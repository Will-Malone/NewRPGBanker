<span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s2">üõë This file is source code, not the primary documentation location</span><span class="s1">! </span><span class="s2">üõë</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;</span>
<span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s2">See </span><span class="s1">**https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/prefer-reduce-type-parameter** </span><span class="s2">for documentation.</span>

<span class="s2">It's common to call `Array#reduce` with a generic type, such as an array or object, as the initial value.</span>
<span class="s2">Since these values are empty, their types are not usable</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">[]</span><span class="s2">` has type `never</span><span class="s1">[]</span><span class="s2">`, which can't have items pushed into it as nothing is type `never`</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`{}` has type `{}`, which doesn't have an index signature and so can</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s2">t have properties added to it</span>

<span class="s2">A common solution to this problem is to use an `as` assertion on the initial value.</span>
<span class="s2">While this will work, it's not the most optimal solution as type assertions have subtle effects on the underlying types that can allow bugs to slip in.</span>

<span class="s2">A better solution is to pass the type in as a generic type argument to `Array#reduce` explicitly.</span>
<span class="s2">This means that TypeScript doesn't have to try to infer the type, and avoids the common pitfalls that come with casting.</span>

<span class="s2">This rule looks for calls to `Array#reduce`, and reports if an initial value is being passed &amp; asserted.</span>
<span class="s2">It will suggest instead pass the asserted type to `Array#reduce` as a generic type argument.</span>
