<span class="s0">/* 
 * Represents an object which can be *sealed* (imperatively marked as 
 * immutable). 
 * 
 * The `sealed` flag is tight to a particular instance of the class and resets 
 * to `false` for all newly created (by copy-constructor, assignment operator 
 * and so on) derivative objects. 
 * 
 * Why do we need this? In Fabric, some objects are semi-immutable 
 * even if they are explicitly marked as `const`. It means that in some special 
 * cases those objects can be const-casted-away and then mutated. That comes 
 * from the fact that we share some object's life-cycle responsibilities with 
 * React and the immutability is guaranteed by some logic split between 
 * native and JavaScript worlds (which makes it impossible to fully use 
 * immutability enforcement at a language level). To detect possible errors as 
 * early as possible we additionally mark objects as *sealed* after some stages 
 * and then enforce this at run-time. 
 * 
 * How to use: 
 *   1. Inherit your class from `Sealable`. 
 *   2. Call `ensureUnsealed()` in all cases where the object might be mutated: 
 *      a. At the beginning of all *always* mutating `non-const` methods; 
 *      b. Right before the place where actual mutation happens in all 
 * *possible* mutating `non-const` methods; c. Right after performing 
 * `const_cast`. (Optionally. This is not strictly necessary but might help 
 * detect problems earlier.) 
 *   3. Call `seal()` at some point from which any modifications 
 *      must be prevented.
