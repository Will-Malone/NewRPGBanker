<span class="s0">/** 
 * RAII Object that attaches a thread to the JVM. Failing to detach from a 
 * thread before it exits will cause a crash, as will calling Detach an extra 
 * time, and this guard class helps keep that straight. In addition, it 
 * remembers whether it performed the attach or not, so it is safe to nest it 
 * with itself or with non-fbjni code that manages the attachment correctly. 
 * 
 * Potential concerns: 
 *  - Attaching to the JVM is fast (~100us on MotoG), but ideally you would 
 * attach while the app is not busy. 
 *  - Having a thread detach at arbitrary points is not safe in Dalvik; you need 
 * to be sure that there is no Java code on the current stack or you run the 
 * risk of a crash like: ERROR: detaching thread with interp frames (count=18) 
 *    (More detail at 
 * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/2H8z5grNqjo) ThreadScope 
 * won't do a detach if the thread was already attached before the guard is 
 *    instantiated, but there's probably some usage that could trip this up. 
 *  - Newly attached C++ threads only get the bootstrap class loader -- i.e. 
 * java language classes, not any of our application's classes. This will be 
 * different behavior than threads that were initiated on the Java side. A 
 * workaround is to pass a global reference for a class or instance to the new 
 * thread; this bypasses the need for the class loader. (See 
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html#attach_current_thread) 
 *    If you need access to the application's classes, you can use 
 * ThreadScope::WithClassLoader.
