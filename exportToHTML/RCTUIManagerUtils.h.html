<span class="s0">/** 
 * Queues Problem Intro: 
 * UIManager queue is a special queue because it has a special relationship with 
 * the Main queue. 
 * 
 * This particular relationship comes from two key factors: 
 *  1. UIManager initiates execution of many blocks on the Main queue; 
 *  2. In some cases, we want to initiate (and wait for) some UIManager's work *synchronously* from 
 *     the Main queue. 
 * 
 * So, how can we meet these criteria? 
 * &quot;Pseudo UIManager queue&quot; comes to rescue! 
 * 
 * &quot;Pseudo UIManager queue&quot; means the safe execution of typical UIManager's work 
 * on the Main queue while the UIManager queue is explicitly blocked for preventing 
 * simultaneous/concurrent memory access. 
 * 
 * So, how can we technically do this? 
 *  1. `RCTAssertUIManagerQueue` is okay with execution on both actual UIManager and 
 *     Pseudo UIManager queues. 
 *  2. Both `RCTExecuteOnUIManagerQueue` and `RCTUnsafeExecuteOnUIManagerQueueSync` 
 *     execute given block *synchronously* if they were called on actual UIManager 
 *     or Pseudo UIManager queues. 
 *  3. `RCTExecuteOnMainQueue` executes given block *synchronously* if we already on 
 *     the Main queue. 
 *  4. `RCTUnsafeExecuteOnUIManagerQueueSync` is smart enough to do the trick: 
 *     It detects calling on the Main queue and in this case, instead of doing 
 *     trivial *synchronous* dispatch, it does: 
 *       - Block the Main queue; 
 *       - Dispatch the special block on UIManager queue to block the queue and 
 *         concurrent memory access; 
 *       - Execute the given block on the Main queue; 
 *       - Unblock the UIManager queue. 
 * 
 * Imagine the analogy: We have two queues: the Main one and UIManager one. 
 * And these queues are two lanes of railway that go in parallel. Then, 
 * at some point, we merge UIManager lane with the Main lane, and all cars use 
 * the unified the Main lane. 
 * And then we split lanes again. 
 * 
 * This solution assumes that the code running on UIManager queue will never 
 * *explicitly* block the Main queue via calling `RCTUnsafeExecuteOnMainQueueSync`. 
 * Otherwise, it can cause a deadlock.
