@interface 
@discussion An instance of JSVirtualMachine represents a single JavaScript &quot;object space&quot; 
 or set of execution resources. Thread safety is supported by locking the 
 virtual machine, with concurrent JavaScript execution supported by allocating 
 separate instances of JSVirtualMachine. 
 
 A virtual machine may need to run deferred tasks on a run loop, such as garbage collection 
 or resolving WebAssembly compilations. By default, a virtual machine will use the run loop 
 of the thread it was initialized on. Currently, there is no API to change a 
 JSVirtualMachine's run loop once it has been initialized.

@discussion Allows clients of JSVirtualMachine to make the JavaScript runtime aware of

 from somewhere in said object graph. 
 
 For correct behavior clients must make their external object graphs

 reachable from within the JavaScript runtime, all managed references  
 transitively reachable from it as recorded using
