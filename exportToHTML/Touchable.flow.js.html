<span class="s0">/** 
 * `Touchable`: Taps done right. 
 * 
 * You hook your `ResponderEventPlugin` events into `Touchable`. `Touchable` 
 * will measure time/geometry and tells you when to give feedback to the user. 
 * 
 * ====================== Touchable Tutorial =============================== 
 * The `Touchable` mixin helps you handle the &quot;press&quot; interaction. It analyzes 
 * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view 
 * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should 
 * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting). 
 * 
 * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight) 
 * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight) 
 * - When a touch was &quot;pressed&quot; - a touch ended while still within the geometry 
 *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has &quot;stolen&quot; touch 
 *   lock (&quot;responder&quot;) (Typically you bounce the element). 
 * 
 * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a 
 * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a 
 * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should 
 * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it 
 * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary 
 * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a &quot;press&quot; is only 
 * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no 
 * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches. 
 * 
 * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the 
 * `Touchable` mixin, do the following: 
 * 
 * - Initialize the `Touchable` state. 
 * 
 *   getInitialState: function() { 
 *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState); 
 *   } 
 * 
 * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive 
 *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder 
 *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose 
 *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence: 
 * 
 *   // In render function: 
 *   return ( 
 *     &lt;View 
 *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder} 
 *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest} 
 *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant} 
 *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove} 
 *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease} 
 *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}&gt; 
 *       &lt;View&gt; 
 *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the 
 *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing 
 *         custom logic that highlights this inner one. 
 *       &lt;/View&gt; 
 *     &lt;/View&gt; 
 *   ); 
 * 
 * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you 
 *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler. 
 * 
 * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide 
 *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods 
 *   that you should implement. 
 * 
 *   touchableHandlePress: function() { 
 *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do. 
 *   }, 
 *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() { 
 *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation 
 *   }, 
 *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() { 
 *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation 
 *   }, 
 * 
 * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below): 
 *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() { 
 *     return 20; 
 *   } 
 *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory). 
 *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() { 
 *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100}; 
 *   }

 * ========== Geometry ========= 
 * `Touchable` only assumes that there exists a `HitRect` node. The `PressRect` 
 * is an abstract box that is extended beyond the `HitRect`. 
 * 
 *  +--------------------------+ 
 *  |                          | - &quot;Start&quot; events in `HitRect` cause `HitRect` 
 *  |  +--------------------+  |   to become the responder. 
 *  |  |  +--------------+  |  | - `HitRect` is typically expanded around 
 *  |  |  |              |  |  |   the `VisualRect`, but shifted downward. 
 *  |  |  |  VisualRect  |  |  | - After pressing down, after some delay, 
 *  |  |  |              |  |  |   and before letting up, the Visual React 
 *  |  |  +--------------+  |  |   will become &quot;active&quot;. This makes it eligible 
 *  |  |     HitRect        |  |   for being highlighted (so long as the 
 *  |  +--------------------+  |   press remains in the `PressRect`). 
 *  |        PressRect     o   | 
 *  +----------------------|---+ 
 *           Out Region    | 
 *                         +-----+ This gap between the `HitRect` and 
 *                                 `PressRect` allows a touch to move far away 
 *                                 from the original hit rect, and remain 
 *                                 highlighted, and eligible for a &quot;Press&quot;. 
 *                                 Customize this via 
 *                                 `touchableGetPressRectOffset()`.
