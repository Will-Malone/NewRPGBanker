<span class="s0">ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA</span>

<span class="s0">I.</span>


<span class="s0">To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</span>

<span class="s0">I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.</span>

<span class="s0">One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.</span>

<span class="s0">His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wedlock suits you,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Seven!&quot; I answered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then, how do you know?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear Holmes,&quot; said I, &quot;this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is simplicity itself,&quot; said he; &quot;my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. &quot;When I hear you give your reasons,&quot; I remarked, &quot;the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite so,&quot; he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. &quot;You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Frequently.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How often?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, some hundreds of times.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then how many are there?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How many? I don't know.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.&quot; He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. &quot;It came by the last post,&quot; said he. &quot;Read it aloud.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,&quot; it said, &quot;a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is indeed a mystery,&quot; I remarked. &quot;What do you imagine that it means?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,&quot; I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. &quot;Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Peculiar--that is the very word,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I did so, and saw a large &quot;E&quot; with a small &quot;g,&quot; a &quot;P,&quot; and a large &quot;G&quot; with a small &quot;t&quot; woven into the texture of the paper.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What do you make of that?&quot; asked Holmes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.&quot; He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. &quot;Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?&quot; His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The paper was made in Bohemia,&quot; I said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A pair, by the sound,&quot; said he. &quot;Yes,&quot; he continued, glancing out of the window. &quot;A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think that I had better go, Holmes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But your client--&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come in!&quot; said Holmes.</span>

<span class="s0">A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You had my note?&quot; he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. &quot;I told you that I would call.&quot; He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pray take a seat,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. &quot;It is both, or none,&quot; said he. &quot;You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. &quot;Then I must begin,&quot; said he, &quot;by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I promise,&quot; said Holmes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You will excuse this mask,&quot; continued our strange visitor. &quot;The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was aware of it,&quot; said Holmes dryly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was also aware of that,&quot; murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,&quot; he remarked, &quot;I should be better able to advise you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. &quot;You are right,&quot; he cried; &quot;I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, indeed?&quot; murmured Holmes. &quot;Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you can understand,&quot; said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, &quot;you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then, pray consult,&quot; said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,&quot; murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let me see!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Precisely so. But how--&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Was there a secret marriage?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;None.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No legal papers or certificates?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;None.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There is the writing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pooh, pooh! Forgery.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My private note-paper.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stolen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My own seal.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Imitated.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My photograph.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bought.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We were both in the photograph.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was mad--insane.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have compromised yourself seriously.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It must be recovered.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We have tried and failed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She will not sell.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stolen, then.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.&quot;</span>



<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. &quot;It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&quot; he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. &quot;He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are certainly joking, Holmes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &quot;It is a question of cubic capacity,&quot; said he; &quot;a man with so large a brain must have something in it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The decline of his fortunes, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes laughed. &quot;Here is the foresight,&quot; said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. &quot;They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But he might be a bachelor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, it is very ingenious,&quot; said I, laughing; &quot;but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!&quot; he gasped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?&quot; Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!&quot; He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. &quot;By Jove, Peterson!&quot; said he, &quot;this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!&quot; I ejaculated.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!&quot; The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,&quot; I remarked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.&quot; He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hum! So much for the police-court,&quot; said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. &quot;The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What will you say?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very. But will he see it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In which, sir?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very well, sir. And this stone?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. &quot;It's a bonny thing,&quot; said he. &quot;Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I cannot tell.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And you can do nothing until then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,&quot; said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. &quot;Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We have retained these things for some days,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. &quot;Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To eat it!&quot; Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, certainly, certainly,&quot; answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The man burst into a hearty laugh. &quot;They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,&quot; said he, &quot;but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There is your hat, then, and there your bird,&quot; said he. &quot;By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. &quot;There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.&quot; With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So much for Mr. Henry Baker,&quot; said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. &quot;It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not particularly.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;By all means.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My geese!&quot; The man seemed surprised.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Indeed! Whose, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Breckinridge is his name.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now for Mr. Breckinridge,&quot; he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. &quot;Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-evening. It's a cold night,&quot; said Holmes.</span>

<span class="s0">The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sold out of geese, I see,&quot; continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's no good.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, but I was recommended to you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who by?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The landlord of the Alpha.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, then, mister,&quot; said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, &quot;what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,&quot; said Holmes carelessly. &quot;If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred,&quot; snapped the salesman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's nothing of the kind.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say it is.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't believe it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You'll never persuade me to believe that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Will you bet, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The salesman chuckled grimly. &quot;Bring me the books, Bill,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, Mr. Cocksure,&quot; said the salesman, &quot;I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249,&quot; read Holmes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Holmes turned to the page indicated. &quot;Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, then, what's the last entry?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite so. There you are. And underneath?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What have you to say now?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,&quot; said he. &quot;I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I've had enough of you and your geese,&quot; he shouted. &quot;I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No; but one of them was mine all the same,&quot; whined the little man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She told me to ask you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!&quot; He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,&quot; whispered Holmes. &quot;Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.&quot; Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who are you, then? What do you want?&quot; he asked in a quavering voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You will excuse me,&quot; said Holmes blandly, &quot;but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you can know nothing of this?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,&quot; cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. &quot;I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. &quot;In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,&quot; said he. &quot;But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The man hesitated for an instant. &quot;My name is John Robinson,&quot; he answered with a sidelong glance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, no; the real name,&quot; said Holmes sweetly. &quot;It is always awkward doing business with an alias.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. &quot;Well then,&quot; said he, &quot;my real name is James Ryder.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here we are!&quot; said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. &quot;The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Ryder quivered with emotion. &quot;Oh, sir,&quot; he cried, &quot;can you tell me where it went to?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It came here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The game's up, Ryder,&quot; said Holmes quietly. &quot;Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,&quot; said he in a crackling voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. &quot;For God's sake, have mercy!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Get back into your chair!&quot; said Holmes sternly. &quot;It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. &quot;I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,&quot; said he. &quot;When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Which dealer's?'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!&quot; He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Get out!&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No more words. Get out!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;After all, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, &quot;I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</span>


<span class="s0">On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.</span>

<span class="s0">It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it, then--a fire?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-morning, madam,&quot; said Holmes cheerily. &quot;My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is not cold which makes me shiver,&quot; said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.&quot; She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You must not fear,&quot; said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. &quot;We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know me, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There is no mystery, my dear madam,&quot; said he, smiling. &quot;The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,&quot; said she. &quot;I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Farintosh,&quot; said he. &quot;Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Alas!&quot; replied our visitor, &quot;the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am all attention, madam.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Holmes nodded his head. &quot;The name is familiar to me,&quot; said he.</span>



<span class="s0">&quot;I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,&quot; said I, &quot;for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Terse and to the point,&quot; remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Anything else?&quot; asked Holmes, yawning.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Before the what?&quot; asked Holmes with a start.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The vanishing of the lady.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When did she vanish, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At the wedding breakfast.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I warn you that they are very incomplete.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps we may make them less so.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot; 'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' &quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And is that all?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And it is--&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lord Robert St. Simon,&quot; announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-day, Lord St. Simon,&quot; said Holmes, rising and bowing. &quot;Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I am descending.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I beg pardon.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My last client of the sort was a king.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The King of Scandinavia.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What! Had he lost his wife?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You can understand,&quot; said Holmes suavely, &quot;that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lord St. Simon glanced over it. &quot;Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pray do so.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In San Francisco, a year ago.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You were travelling in the States?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did you become engaged then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you were on a friendly footing?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Her father is very rich?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how did he make his money?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. &quot;You see, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he, &quot;my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear&quot;--he gave a little stately cough--&quot;had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you her photograph?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I brought this with me.&quot; He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I really have made no inquiries on the subject.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Was she in good spirits?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And did you observe any change in her then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pray let us have it, for all that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I saw her in conversation with her maid.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And who is her maid?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A confidential servant?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How long did she speak to this Alice?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You did not overhear what they said?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She walked into the breakfast-room.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On your arm?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. &quot;We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did your wife hear all this?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, thank goodness, she did not.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, it is a possible supposition.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You think so, too?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,&quot; said Holmes, smiling. &quot;And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We could see the other side of the road and the Park.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,&quot; said our client, rising.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have solved it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh? What was that?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say that I have solved it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where, then, is my wife?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lord St. Simon shook his head. &quot;I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,&quot; he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. &quot;I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I have heard all that you have heard.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's up, then?&quot; asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. &quot;You look dissatisfied.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Really! You surprise me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And very wet it seems to have made you,&quot; said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In heaven's name, what for?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why? What do you mean?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. &quot;I suppose you know all about it,&quot; he snarled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think it very unlikely.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?&quot; He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. &quot;There,&quot; said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. &quot;There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. &quot;You dragged them from the Serpentine?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am afraid that you will find it difficult.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are you, indeed, now?&quot; cried Lestrade with some bitterness. &quot;I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.&quot; He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. &quot;Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very good, Lestrade,&quot; said Holmes, laughing. &quot;You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.&quot; He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. &quot;This is indeed important,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha! you find it so?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. &quot;Why,&quot; he shrieked, &quot;you're looking at the wrong side!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary, this is the right side.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There's nothing in it. I looked at it before,&quot; said Lestrade. &quot; 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I've wasted time enough,&quot; said Lestrade, rising. &quot;I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.&quot; He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just one hint to you, Lestrade,&quot; drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; &quot;I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.</span>

<span class="s0">He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. &quot;There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,&quot; he remarked, &quot;so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.</span>

<span class="s0">Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They have laid the supper, then,&quot; he said, rubbing his hands.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,&quot; said he. &quot;I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</span>



<span class="s0">To conserve the patient's strength by preventing or diminishing the</span>
<span class="s0">severity of the spasms, he should be placed in a quiet room, and every</span>
<span class="s0">form of disturbance avoided. Sedatives, such as bromides, paraldehyde,</span>
<span class="s0">or opium, must be given in large doses. Chloral is perhaps the best, and</span>
<span class="s0">the patient should rarely have less than 150 grains in twenty-four</span>
<span class="s0">hours. When he is unable to swallow, it should be given by the rectum.</span>
<span class="s0">The administration of chloroform is of value in conserving the strength</span>
<span class="s0">of the patient, by abolishing the spasms, and enabling the attendants to</span>
<span class="s0">administer nourishment or drugs either through a stomach tube or by the</span>
<span class="s0">rectum. Extreme elevation of temperature is met by tepid sponging. It is</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to use the catheter if retention of urine occurs.</span>


<span class="s0">HYDROPHOBIA</span>

<span class="s0">Hydrophobia is an acute infective disease following on the bite of a</span>
<span class="s0">rabid animal. It most commonly follows the bite or lick of a rabid dog</span>
<span class="s0">or cat. The virus appears to be communicated through the saliva of the</span>
<span class="s0">animal, and to show a marked affinity for nerve tissues; and the disease</span>
<span class="s0">is most likely to develop when the patient is infected on the face or</span>
<span class="s0">other uncovered part, or in a part richly endowed with nerves.</span>

<span class="s0">A dog which has bitten a person should on no account be killed until its</span>
<span class="s0">condition has been proved one way or the other. Should rabies develop</span>
<span class="s0">and its destruction become necessary, the head and spinal cord should be</span>
<span class="s0">retained and forwarded, packed in ice, to a competent observer. Much</span>
<span class="s0">anxiety to the person bitten and to his friends would be avoided if</span>
<span class="s0">these rules were observed, because in many cases it will be shown that</span>
<span class="s0">the animal did not after all suffer from rabies, and that the patient</span>
<span class="s0">consequently runs no risk. If, on the other hand, rabies is proved to be</span>
<span class="s0">present, the patient should be submitted to the Pasteur treatment.</span>

<span class="s0">_Clinical Features._--There is almost always a history of the patient</span>
<span class="s0">having been bitten or licked by an animal supposed to suffer from</span>
<span class="s0">rabies. The incubation period averages about forty days, but varies from</span>
<span class="s0">a fortnight to seven or eight months, and is shorter in young than in</span>
<span class="s0">old persons. The original wound has long since healed, and beyond a</span>
<span class="s0">slight itchiness or pain shooting along the nerves of the part, shows no</span>
<span class="s0">sign of disturbance. A few days of general malaise, with chills and</span>
<span class="s0">giddiness precede the onset of the acute manifestations, which affect</span>
<span class="s0">chiefly the muscles of deglutition and respiration. One of the earliest</span>
<span class="s0">signs is that the patient has periodically a sudden catch in his</span>
<span class="s0">breathing &quot;resembling what often occurs when a person goes into a cold</span>
<span class="s0">bath.&quot; This is due to spasm of the diaphragm, and is frequently</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied by a loud-sounding hiccough, likened by the laity to the</span>
<span class="s0">barking of a dog. Difficulty in swallowing fluids may be the first</span>
<span class="s0">symptom.</span>

<span class="s0">The spasms rapidly spread to all the muscles of deglutition and</span>
<span class="s0">respiration, so that the patient not only has the greatest difficulty in</span>
<span class="s0">swallowing, but has a constant sense of impending suffocation. To add to</span>
<span class="s0">his distress, a copious secretion of viscid saliva fills his mouth. Any</span>
<span class="s0">voluntary effort, as well as all forms of external stimuli, only serve</span>
<span class="s0">to aggravate the spasms which are always induced by the attempt to</span>
<span class="s0">swallow fluid, or even by the sound of running water.</span>

<span class="s0">The temperature is raised; the pulse is small, rapid, and intermittent;</span>
<span class="s0">and the urine may contain sugar and albumen.</span>

<span class="s0">The mind may remain clear to the end, or the patient may have delusions,</span>
<span class="s0">supposing himself to be surrounded by terrifying forms. There is always</span>
<span class="s0">extreme mental agitation and despair, and the sufferer is in constant</span>
<span class="s0">fear of his impending fate. Happily the inevitable issue is not long</span>
<span class="s0">delayed, death usually occurring in from two to four days from the</span>
<span class="s0">onset. The symptoms of the disease are so characteristic that there is</span>
<span class="s0">no difficulty in diagnosis. The only condition with which it is liable</span>
<span class="s0">to be confused is the variety of cephalic tetanus in which the muscles</span>
<span class="s0">of deglutition are specially involved--the so-called tetanus</span>
<span class="s0">hydrophobicus.</span>

<span class="s0">_Prophylaxis._--The bite of an animal suspected of being rabid should be</span>
<span class="s0">cauterised at once by means of the actual or Paquelin cautery, or by a</span>
<span class="s0">strong chemical escharotic such as pure carbolic acid, after which</span>
<span class="s0">antiseptic dressings are applied.</span>

<span class="s0">It is, however, to Pasteur's _preventive inoculation_ that we must look</span>
<span class="s0">for our best hope of averting the onset of symptoms. &quot;It may now be</span>
<span class="s0">taken as established that a grave responsibility rests on those</span>
<span class="s0">concerned if a person bitten by a mad animal is not subjected to the</span>
<span class="s0">Pasteur treatment&quot; (Muir and Ritchie).</span>

<span class="s0">This method is based on the fact that the long incubation period of the</span>
<span class="s0">disease admits of the patient being inoculated with a modified virus</span>
<span class="s0">producing a mild attack, which protects him from the natural disease.</span>

<span class="s0">_Treatment._--When the symptoms have once developed they can only be</span>
<span class="s0">palliated. The patient must be kept absolutely quiet and free from all</span>
<span class="s0">sources of irritation. The spasms may be diminished by means of chloral</span>
<span class="s0">and bromides, or by chloroform inhalation.</span>


<span class="s0">ANTHRAX</span>

<span class="s0">Anthrax is a comparatively rare disease, communicable to man from</span>
<span class="s0">certain of the lower animals, such as sheep, oxen, horses, deer, and</span>
<span class="s0">other herbivora. In animals it is characterised by symptoms of acute</span>
<span class="s0">general poisoning, and, from the fact that it produces a marked</span>
<span class="s0">enlargement of the spleen, is known in veterinary surgery as &quot;splenic</span>
<span class="s0">fever.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The _bacillus anthracis_ (Fig. 27), the largest of the known pathogenic</span>
<span class="s0">bacteria, occurs in groups or in chains made up of numerous bacilli,</span>
<span class="s0">each bacillus measuring from 6 to 8 u in length. The organisms are found</span>
<span class="s0">in enormous numbers throughout the bodies of animals that have died of</span>
<span class="s0">anthrax, and are readily recognised and cultivated. Sporulation only</span>
<span class="s0">takes place outside the body, probably because free oxygen is necessary</span>
<span class="s0">to the process. In the spore-free condition, the organisms are readily</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed by ordinary germicides, and by the gastric juice. The spores,</span>
<span class="s0">on the other hand, have a high degree of resistance. Not only do they</span>
<span class="s0">remain viable in the dry state for long periods, even up to a year, but</span>
<span class="s0">they survive boiling for five minutes, and must be subjected to dry heat</span>
<span class="s0">at 140 o C. for several hours before they are destroyed.</span>

<span class="s0">[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Bacillus of Anthrax in section of skin, from a</span>
<span class="s0">case of malignant pustule; shows vesicle containing bacilli. x 400 diam.</span>
<span class="s0">Gram's stain.]</span>

<span class="s0">_Clinical Varieties of Anthrax._--In man, anthrax may manifest itself in</span>
<span class="s0">one of three clinical forms.</span>

<span class="s0">It may be transmitted by means of spores or bacilli directly from a</span>
<span class="s0">diseased animal to those who, by their occupation or otherwise, are</span>
<span class="s0">brought into contact with it--for example, shepherds, butchers,</span>
<span class="s0">veterinary surgeons, or hide-porters. Infection may occur on the face by</span>
<span class="s0">the use of a shaving-brush contaminated by spores. The path of infection</span>
<span class="s0">is usually through an abrasion of the skin, and the primary</span>
<span class="s0">manifestations are local, constituting what is known as _the malignant</span>
<span class="s0">pustule_.</span>

<span class="s0">In other cases the disease is contracted through the inhalation of the</span>
<span class="s0">dried spores into the respiratory passages. This occurs oftenest in</span>
<span class="s0">those who work amongst wool, fur, and rags, and a form of acute</span>
<span class="s0">pneumonia of great virulence ensues. This affection is known as</span>
<span class="s0">_wool-sorter's disease_, and is almost universally fatal.</span>

<span class="s0">There is reason to believe that infection may also take place by means</span>
<span class="s0">of spores ingested into the alimentary canal in meat or milk derived</span>
<span class="s0">from diseased animals, or in infected water.</span>


<span class="s0">become associated with branches from the musculo-cutaneous is followed</span>
<span class="s0">by a loss of sensibility on the radial side of the hand and thumb. Wounds</span>
<span class="s0">on the dorsal surface of the wrist and forearm are often followed by</span>
<span class="s0">loss of sensibility over a larger area, because the musculo-cutaneous</span>
<span class="s0">nerve is divided as well, and some of the fibres of the lower lateral</span>
<span class="s0">cutaneous branch of the radial.</span>

<span class="s0">[Illustration: FIG. 91.--To illustrate the Loss of Sensation produced by</span>
<span class="s0">Division of the Median Nerve. The area of complete cutaneous</span>
<span class="s0">insensibility is shaded black. The parts insensitive to light touch and</span>
<span class="s0">to intermediate degrees of temperature are enclosed within the dotted</span>
<span class="s0">line.</span>

<span class="s0">(After Head and Sherren.)]</span>

<span class="s0">#The Median Nerve# is most frequently injured in wounds made by broken</span>
<span class="s0">glass in the region of the wrist. It may also be injured in fractures of</span>
<span class="s0">the lower end of the humerus, in fractures of both bones of the forearm,</span>
<span class="s0">and as a result of pressure by splints. After _division at the elbow_,</span>
<span class="s0">there is impairment of mobility which affects the thumb, and to a less</span>
<span class="s0">extent the index finger: the terminal phalanx of the thumb cannot be</span>
<span class="s0">flexed owing to the paralysis of the flexor pollicis longus, and the</span>
<span class="s0">index can only be flexed at its metacarpo-phalangeal joint by the</span>
<span class="s0">interosseous muscles attached to it. Pronation of the forearm is feeble,</span>
<span class="s0">and is completed by the weight of the hand. After _division at the</span>
<span class="s0">wrist_, the abductor-opponens group of muscles and the two lateral</span>
<span class="s0">lumbricals only are affected; the abduction of the thumb can be feebly</span>
<span class="s0">imitated by the short extensor and the long abductor (ext. ossis</span>
<span class="s0">metacarpi pollicis), while opposition may be simulated by contraction of</span>
<span class="s0">the long flexor and the short abductor of the thumb; the paralysis of</span>
<span class="s0">the two medial lumbricals produces no symptoms that can be recognised.</span>
<span class="s0">It is important to remember that when the median nerve is divided at the</span>
<span class="s0">wrist, deep touch can be appreciated over the whole of the area</span>
<span class="s0">supplied by the nerve; the injury, therefore, is liable to be over</span>
<span class="s0">looked. If, however, the tendons are divided as well as the nerve, there</span>
<span class="s0">is insensibility to deep touch. The areas of epicritic and of</span>
<span class="s0">protopathic insensibility are illustrated in Fig. 91. The division of</span>
<span class="s0">the nerve at the elbow, or even at the axilla, does not increase the</span>
<span class="s0">extent of the loss of epicritic or protopathic sensibility, but usually</span>
<span class="s0">affects deep sensibility.</span>

<span class="s0">[Illustration: FIG. 92.--To illustrate Loss of Sensation produced by</span>

<span class="s0">#The Ulnar Nerve.#--The most common injury of this nerve is its division</span>
<span class="s0">in transverse accidental wounds just above the wrist. In the arm it may</span>
<span class="s0">be contused, along with the radial, in crutch paralysis; in the region</span>
<span class="s0">of the elbow it may be injured in fractures or dislocations, or it may</span>
<span class="s0">be accidentally divided in the operation for excising the elbow-joint.</span>


<span class="s0">same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and</span>
<span class="s0">traditions, Bolkonski would soon have discovered his weak, human,</span>
<span class="s0">unheroic sides; but as it was, Speranski's strange and logical turn of</span>
<span class="s0">mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite</span>
<span class="s0">understand him. Moreover, Speranski, either because he appreciated the</span>
<span class="s0">other's capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to</span>
<span class="s0">his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes</span>
<span class="s0">hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption</span>
<span class="s0">that one's companion is the only man besides oneself capable of</span>
<span class="s0">understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the</span>
<span class="s0">reasonableness and profundity of one's own ideas.</span>

<span class="s0">During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speranski</span>
<span class="s0">more than once remarked: &quot;We regard everything that is above the</span>
<span class="s0">common level of rooted custom...&quot; or, with a smile: &quot;But we want the</span>
<span class="s0">wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe...&quot; or: &quot;They cannot</span>
<span class="s0">understand this...&quot; and all in a way that seemed to say: &quot;We, you</span>
<span class="s0">and I, understand what they are and who we are.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">This first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened in</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first</span>
<span class="s0">meeting. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast</span>
<span class="s0">intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power,</span>
<span class="s0">which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia. In Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's eyes Speranski was the man he would himself have wished to</span>
<span class="s0">be--one who explained all the facts of life reasonably, considered</span>
<span class="s0">important only what was rational, and was capable of applying the</span>
<span class="s0">standard of reason to everything. Everything seemed so simple and</span>
<span class="s0">clear in Speranski's exposition that Prince Andrew involuntarily</span>
<span class="s0">agreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued, it was</span>
<span class="s0">only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit</span>
<span class="s0">to Speranski's opinions entirely. Everything was right and</span>
<span class="s0">everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew. This was Speranski's cold, mirrorlike look, which did not</span>
<span class="s0">allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands,</span>
<span class="s0">which Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the</span>
<span class="s0">hands of those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those</span>
<span class="s0">delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was</span>
<span class="s0">unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he</span>
<span class="s0">observed in Speranski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he</span>
<span class="s0">used to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental</span>
<span class="s0">device, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a</span>
<span class="s0">practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and</span>
<span class="s0">laugh ironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one</span>
<span class="s0">he very frequently employed.) He would transfer a question to</span>
<span class="s0">metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time, and</span>
<span class="s0">thought, and, having deduced the refutation he needed, would again</span>
<span class="s0">descend to the level of the original discussion.</span>

<span class="s0">In general the trait of Speranski's mentality which struck Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and</span>
<span class="s0">authority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur</span>
<span class="s0">to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is</span>
<span class="s0">after all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had</span>
<span class="s0">never felt the doubt, &quot;Is not all I think and believe nonsense?&quot; And</span>
<span class="s0">it was just this peculiarity of Speranski's mind that particularly</span>
<span class="s0">attracted Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt a</span>
<span class="s0">passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt</span>
<span class="s0">for Bonaparte. The fact that Speranski was the son of a village</span>
<span class="s0">priest, and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account</span>
<span class="s0">of his humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to</span>
<span class="s0">cherish his sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to</span>
<span class="s0">strengthen it.</span>

<span class="s0">On that first evening Bolkonski spent with him, having mentioned the</span>
<span class="s0">Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speranski told him</span>
<span class="s0">sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and</span>
<span class="s0">fifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that</span>
<span class="s0">Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the</span>
<span class="s0">different codes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said he. &quot;We want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have</span>
<span class="s0">no laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to</span>
<span class="s0">serve in these times!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in</span>
<span class="s0">jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious</span>
<span class="s0">circle from which we must break a way out.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army</span>
<span class="s0">Regulations and--what he had not at all expected--was chairman of a</span>
<span class="s0">section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski's request he took the first part of the Civil Code that</span>
<span class="s0">was being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the</span>
<span class="s0">Institutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section on</span>
<span class="s0">Personal Rights.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found</span>
<span class="s0">himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He</span>
<span class="s0">arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members,</span>
<span class="s0">and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic</span>
<span class="s0">charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented</span>
<span class="s0">as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the</span>
<span class="s0">majority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported almost</span>
<span class="s0">singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg.</span>

<span class="s0">His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations</span>
<span class="s0">and dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he</span>
<span class="s0">considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations</span>
<span class="s0">of the bachelor circles in which he moved.</span>

<span class="s0">Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to</span>
<span class="s0">rest upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under</span>
<span class="s0">him. At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under</span>
<span class="s0">him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had</span>
<span class="s0">joined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who</span>
<span class="s0">confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his</span>
<span class="s0">foot down it sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness the ground,</span>
<span class="s0">he put his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in</span>
<span class="s0">it, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.</span>

<span class="s0">Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg--he had of late stood</span>
<span class="s0">aside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost</span>
<span class="s0">entirely in Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew</span>
<span class="s0">in ordinary life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely</span>
<span class="s0">as Brothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Ivan Vasilevich D.,</span>
<span class="s0">whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under</span>
<span class="s0">the Masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at</span>
<span class="s0">which they aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and</span>
<span class="s0">reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in</span>
<span class="s0">promises from a dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay</span>
<span class="s0">as himself, Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother</span>
<span class="s0">promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on</span>
<span class="s0">which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul.</span>

<span class="s0">He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first</span>
<span class="s0">he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the</span>
<span class="s0">lodges or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the</span>
<span class="s0">mystical science of the order: with questions of the threefold</span>
<span class="s0">designation of God, the three primordial elements--sulphur, mercury,</span>
<span class="s0">and salt--or the meaning of the square and all the various figures</span>
<span class="s0">of the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to</span>
<span class="s0">which the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought,</span>
<span class="s0">Joseph Alexeevich himself, but he did not share their interests. His</span>
<span class="s0">heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.</span>

<span class="s0">In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like</span>
<span class="s0">him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a</span>
<span class="s0">straight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.</span>

<span class="s0">In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority)</span>
<span class="s0">who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and</span>
<span class="s0">ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without</span>
<span class="s0">troubling about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and</span>
<span class="s0">even the Grand Master of the principal lodge.</span>

<span class="s0">Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,</span>
<span class="s0">particularly those who had lately joined. These according to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor</span>
<span class="s0">desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate</span>
<span class="s0">with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their</span>
<span class="s0">connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing.</span>
<span class="s0">Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him</span>
<span class="s0">based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry</span>
<span class="s0">itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path</span>
<span class="s0">and deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end of</span>
<span class="s0">the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the</span>
<span class="s0">order.</span>

<span class="s0">In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our</span>
<span class="s0">Freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov</span>
<span class="s0">had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons, had been</span>
<span class="s0">initiated into many mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade,</span>
<span class="s0">and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the</span>
<span class="s0">advantage of the Masonic cause in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons</span>
<span class="s0">all came to see him, tried to ingratiate themselves with him, and it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and</span>
<span class="s0">concealing it.</span>

<span class="s0">A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened,</span>
<span class="s0">at which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers</span>
<span class="s0">what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their</span>
<span class="s0">order. The meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">rose and began his address.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear Brothers,&quot; he began, blushing and stammering, with a written</span>
<span class="s0">speech in his hand, &quot;it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries</span>
<span class="s0">in the seclusion of our lodge--we must act--act! We are drowsing,</span>
<span class="s0">but we must act.&quot; Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of</span>
<span class="s0">virtue,&quot; he read, &quot;we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse</span>
<span class="s0">principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the</span>
<span class="s0">education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the</span>
<span class="s0">wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity,</span>
<span class="s0">and folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by</span>
<span class="s0">unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over</span>
<span class="s0">vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this</span>
<span class="s0">world, receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great</span>
<span class="s0">endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of</span>
<span class="s0">today. What is to be done in these circumstances? To favor</span>
<span class="s0">revolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?... No! We are</span>
<span class="s0">very far from that. Every violent reform deserves censure, for it</span>
<span class="s0">quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, and also</span>
<span class="s0">because wisdom needs no violence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of</span>
<span class="s0">preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of</span>
<span class="s0">conviction--aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and</span>
<span class="s0">patronizing talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and</span>
<span class="s0">attaching them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the</span>
<span class="s0">power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder</span>
<span class="s0">and to control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we</span>
<span class="s0">must found a form of government holding universal sway, which should</span>
<span class="s0">be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of</span>
<span class="s0">citizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue in</span>
<span class="s0">their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great</span>
<span class="s0">aim of our order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice.</span>
<span class="s0">This aim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and</span>
<span class="s0">good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction</span>
<span class="s0">of the best and wisest men.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching</span>
<span class="s0">alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her</span>
<span class="s0">with special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods.</span>
<span class="s0">It is now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in</span>
<span class="s0">virtue a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate</span>
<span class="s0">the passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it</span>
<span class="s0">is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his</span>
<span class="s0">passions within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means</span>
<span class="s0">to that end.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,</span>
<span class="s0">each of them again training two others and all being closely united,</span>
<span class="s0">everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished much for the welfare of mankind.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">This speech not only made a strong impression, but created</span>
<span class="s0">excitement in the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it</span>
<span class="s0">dangerous designs of Illuminism,* met it with a coldness that</span>
<span class="s0">surprised Pierre. The Grand Master began answering him, and Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">began developing his views with more and more warmth. It was long</span>
<span class="s0">since there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties were formed, some</span>
<span class="s0">accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others supporting him. At that</span>
<span class="s0">meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of</span>
<span class="s0">men's minds, which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself</span>
<span class="s0">identically to two persons. Even those members who seemed to be on his</span>
<span class="s0">side understood him in their own way with limitations and</span>
<span class="s0">alterations he could not agree to, as what he always wanted most was</span>
<span class="s0">to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it.</span>


<span class="s0">*The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical</span>
<span class="s0">institutions.</span>


<span class="s0">At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will</span>
<span class="s0">reproved Bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue</span>
<span class="s0">alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would</span>
<span class="s0">be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for</span>
<span class="s0">the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For</span>
<span class="s0">three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a</span>
<span class="s0">sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere.</span>

<span class="s0">It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who</span>
<span class="s0">implored him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and</span>
<span class="s0">how she wished to devote her whole life to him.</span>

<span class="s0">At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she</span>
<span class="s0">would return to Petersburg from abroad.</span>

<span class="s0">Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and,</span>
<span class="s0">turning the conversation upon Pierre's matrimonial affairs, by way</span>
<span class="s0">of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his</span>
<span class="s0">wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of</span>
<span class="s0">Freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent.</span>

<span class="s0">At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasili's wife, sent to</span>
<span class="s0">him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a</span>
<span class="s0">most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy</span>
<span class="s0">against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and</span>
<span class="s0">in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him.</span>
<span class="s0">Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much</span>
<span class="s0">importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed</span>
<span class="s0">him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his</span>
<span class="s0">wife.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to</span>
<span class="s0">blame,&quot; he thought.</span>

<span class="s0">If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife,</span>
<span class="s0">it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to</span>
<span class="s0">take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned</span>
<span class="s0">her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of</span>
<span class="s0">indifference whether he lived with his wife or not?</span>

<span class="s0">Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see</span>
<span class="s0">Joseph Alexeevich. This is what he noted in his diary:</span>


<span class="s0">Moscow, 17th November</span>

<span class="s0">I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down</span>
<span class="s0">what I have experienced. Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has</span>
<span class="s0">for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the</span>
<span class="s0">bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of</span>
<span class="s0">complaint. From morning till late at night, except when he eats his</span>
<span class="s0">very plain food, he is working at science. He received me graciously</span>
<span class="s0">and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay. I made the sign of</span>
<span class="s0">the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem, and he responded in the same</span>
<span class="s0">manner, asking me with a mild smile what I had learned and gained in</span>
<span class="s0">the Prussian and Scottish lodges. I told him everything as best I</span>
<span class="s0">could, and told him what I had proposed to our Petersburg lodge, of</span>
<span class="s0">the bad reception I had encountered, and of my rupture with the</span>
<span class="s0">Brothers. Joseph Alexeevich, having remained silent and thoughtful for</span>
<span class="s0">a good while, told me his view of the matter, which at once lit up for</span>
<span class="s0">me my whole past and the future path I should follow. He surprised</span>
<span class="s0">me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the order:</span>
<span class="s0">(1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The purification</span>
<span class="s0">and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The</span>
<span class="s0">improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which</span>
<span class="s0">is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and</span>
<span class="s0">self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently</span>
<span class="s0">of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the</span>
<span class="s0">greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of</span>
<span class="s0">this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our</span>
<span class="s0">impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of the</span>
<span class="s0">human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and</span>
<span class="s0">profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is</span>
<span class="s0">attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground</span>
<span class="s0">Joseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in</span>
<span class="s0">the depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs</span>
<span class="s0">he said to me, &quot;the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you,</span>
<span class="s0">lies in perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the</span>
<span class="s0">difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on</span>
<span class="s0">the contrary, my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares</span>
<span class="s0">that we can attain our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge--for man</span>
<span class="s0">can only know himself by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can</span>
<span class="s0">only be attained by conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief</span>
<span class="s0">virtue--love of death. Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its</span>
<span class="s0">vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new</span>
<span class="s0">life.&quot; These words are all the more remarkable because, in spite of</span>
<span class="s0">his great physical sufferings, Joseph Alexeevich is never weary of</span>
<span class="s0">life though he loves death, for which--in spite of the purity and</span>
<span class="s0">loftiness of his inner man--he does not yet feel himself</span>
<span class="s0">sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained to me fully the</span>
<span class="s0">meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me that the</span>
<span class="s0">numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He advised me not</span>
<span class="s0">to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to take up only</span>
<span class="s0">second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting the</span>
<span class="s0">Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path</span>
<span class="s0">self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for</span>
<span class="s0">myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that</span>
<span class="s0">end he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which</span>
<span class="s0">I will in future note down all my actions.</span>


<span class="s0">Petersburg, 23rd November</span>

<span class="s0">I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears</span>
<span class="s0">and said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her;</span>
<span class="s0">that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I</span>
<span class="s0">knew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to</span>
<span class="s0">go on refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know</span>
<span class="s0">whose aid and advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would</span>
<span class="s0">have told me what to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph</span>
<span class="s0">Alexeevich's letters and recalled my conversations with him, and</span>
<span class="s0">deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a suppliant, and</span>
<span class="s0">ought to reach a helping hand to everyone--especially to one so</span>
<span class="s0">closely bound to me--and that I must bear my cross. But if I forgive</span>
<span class="s0">her for the sake of doing right, then let union with her have only a</span>
<span class="s0">spiritual aim. That is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph</span>
<span class="s0">Alexeevich. I told my wife that I begged her to forget the past, to</span>
<span class="s0">forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her, and that I had</span>
<span class="s0">nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need not know</span>
<span class="s0">how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on the upper</span>
<span class="s0">floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">regeneration.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at</span>
<span class="s0">court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each</span>
<span class="s0">with its own particular tone. The largest of these was the French</span>
<span class="s0">circle of the Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumyantsev</span>
<span class="s0">and Caulaincourt. In this group Helene, as soon as she had settled</span>
<span class="s0">in Petersburg with her husband, took a very prominent place. She was</span>
<span class="s0">visited by the members of the French embassy and by many belonging</span>
<span class="s0">to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners.</span>

<span class="s0">Helene had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperors and had brought from there these connections with the</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleonic notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;C'est un superbe animal.&quot;* Her success as a beautiful and elegant</span>
<span class="s0">woman did not surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer</span>
<span class="s0">than before. What did surprise him was that during these last two</span>
<span class="s0">years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation &quot;d' une femme</span>
<span class="s0">charmante, aussi spirituelle que belle.&quot;*[2] The distinguished</span>
<span class="s0">Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. Bilibin saved up his</span>
<span class="s0">epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezukhova's presence. To be</span>
<span class="s0">received in the Countess Bezukhova's salon was regarded as a diploma</span>
<span class="s0">of intellect. Young men read books before attending Helene's evenings,</span>
<span class="s0">to have something to say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy,</span>
<span class="s0">and even ambassadors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a</span>
<span class="s0">way Helene was a power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid,</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes attended, with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her</span>
<span class="s0">evenings and dinner parties, where politics, poetry, and philosophy</span>
<span class="s0">were discussed. At these parties his feelings were like those of a</span>
<span class="s0">conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment.</span>
<span class="s0">But whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a</span>
<span class="s0">salon, or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the</span>
<span class="s0">deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and Helene Bezukhova's</span>
<span class="s0">reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established</span>
<span class="s0">that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody</span>
<span class="s0">would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound</span>
<span class="s0">meaning in it of which she herself had no conception.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;That's a superb animal.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">*[2] &quot;Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He</span>
<span class="s0">was that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no</span>
<span class="s0">one's way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general</span>
<span class="s0">impression of the drawing room, he served, by the contrast he</span>
<span class="s0">presented to her, as an advantageous background to his elegant and</span>
<span class="s0">tactful wife. Pierre during the last two years, as a result of his</span>
<span class="s0">continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt</span>
<span class="s0">for all else, had acquired in his wife's circle, which did not</span>
<span class="s0">interest him, that air of unconcern, indifference, and benevolence</span>
<span class="s0">toward all, which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">inspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife's drawing room as</span>
<span class="s0">one enters a theater, was acquainted with everybody, equally pleased</span>
<span class="s0">to see everyone, and equally indifferent to them all. Sometimes he</span>
<span class="s0">joined in a conversation which interested him and, regardless of</span>
<span class="s0">whether any &quot;gentlemen of the embassy&quot; were present or not,</span>
<span class="s0">lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not at all in</span>
<span class="s0">accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general opinion</span>
<span class="s0">concerning the queer husband of &quot;the most distinguished woman in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg&quot; was so well established that no one took his freaks</span>
<span class="s0">seriously.</span>

<span class="s0">Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, Boris</span>
<span class="s0">Drubetskoy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was</span>
<span class="s0">the most intimate friend of the Bezukhov household since Helene's</span>
<span class="s0">return from Erfurt. Helene spoke of him as &quot;mon page&quot; and treated</span>
<span class="s0">him like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody, but</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Boris</span>
<span class="s0">behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade of</span>
<span class="s0">deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three</span>
<span class="s0">years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected</span>
<span class="s0">him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition,</span>
<span class="s0">first by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing</span>
<span class="s0">himself to suspect.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally</span>
<span class="s0">renounced her former infatuations,&quot; he told himself. &quot;There has</span>
<span class="s0">never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs</span>
<span class="s0">of the heart&quot;--a statement which, though gathered from an unknown</span>
<span class="s0">source, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Boris' presence</span>
<span class="s0">in his wife's drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a</span>
<span class="s0">physical effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed</span>
<span class="s0">the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a strange antipathy,&quot; thought Pierre, &quot;yet I used to like</span>
<span class="s0">him very much.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather</span>
<span class="s0">blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who</span>
<span class="s0">did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured</span>
<span class="s0">fellow. But a complex and difficult process of internal development</span>
<span class="s0">was taking place all this time in Pierre's soul, revealing much to him</span>
<span class="s0">and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it</span>
<span class="s0">during that time:</span>


<span class="s0">24th November</span>

<span class="s0">Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. [By</span>
<span class="s0">Joseph Alexeevich's advice Pierre had entered the service of the state</span>
<span class="s0">and served on one of the committees.] Returned home for dinner and</span>
<span class="s0">dined alone--the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and</span>
<span class="s0">drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the</span>
<span class="s0">Brothers. In the evening I went down to the countess and told a</span>
<span class="s0">funny story about B., and only remembered that I ought not to have</span>
<span class="s0">done so when everybody laughed loudly at it.</span>

<span class="s0">I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me</span>
<span class="s0">to walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and</span>
<span class="s0">deliberation, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion,</span>
<span class="s0">(3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the</span>
<span class="s0">state, (b) family duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the</span>
<span class="s0">management of my affairs.</span>


<span class="s0">27th November</span>

<span class="s0">I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,</span>
<span class="s0">help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the</span>
<span class="s0">Scriptures, but without proper feeling. Brother Urusov came and we</span>
<span class="s0">talked about worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor's new</span>
<span class="s0">projects. I began to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my</span>
<span class="s0">benefactor's words--that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker</span>
<span class="s0">for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not</span>
<span class="s0">called on to assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O.</span>
<span class="s0">visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a</span>
<span class="s0">new Brother. They laid on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak</span>
<span class="s0">and unworthy. Then our talk turned to the interpretation of the</span>
<span class="s0">seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven sciences, the seven</span>
<span class="s0">virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="s0">Brother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the admission took place.</span>
<span class="s0">The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the</span>
<span class="s0">magnificence of the spectacle. It was Boris Drubetskoy who was</span>
<span class="s0">admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange feeling</span>
<span class="s0">agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber. I</span>
<span class="s0">caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I</span>
<span class="s0">vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like to save him</span>
<span class="s0">from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of</span>
<span class="s0">him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in entering</span>
<span class="s0">the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of</span>
<span class="s0">our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several times</span>
<span class="s0">whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I</span>
<span class="s0">could not reply) and that according to my observation he is</span>
<span class="s0">incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied</span>
<span class="s0">and satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I</span>
<span class="s0">had no cause to doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all</span>
<span class="s0">the time I stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me</span>
<span class="s0">that he was smiling contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to</span>
<span class="s0">stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it. I could not be</span>
<span class="s0">eloquent, nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to</span>
<span class="s0">the Grand Master. Great Architect of Nature, help me to find the</span>
<span class="s0">true path out of the labyrinth of lies!</span>


 <span class="s0">After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then</span>
<span class="s0">the following was written:</span>


<span class="s0">I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who</span>
<span class="s0">advised me to hold fast by brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was</span>
<span class="s0">revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim</span>
<span class="s0">is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name</span>
<span class="s0">unutterable which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen,</span>
<span class="s0">refresh, and support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt</span>
<span class="s0">has no place. The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane</span>
<span class="s0">science and our sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human</span>
<span class="s0">sciences dissect everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to</span>
<span class="s0">examine it. In the holy science of our order all is one, all is</span>
<span class="s0">known in its entirety and life. The Trinity--the three elements of</span>
<span class="s0">matter--are sulphur, mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and</span>
<span class="s0">fiery nature; in combination with salt by its fiery nature it</span>
<span class="s0">arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts</span>
<span class="s0">mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination produces other</span>
<span class="s0">bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence. Christ, the</span>
<span class="s0">Holy Spirit, Him!...</span>


<span class="s0">3rd December</span>

<span class="s0">Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went</span>
<span class="s0">and paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but</span>
<span class="s0">instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago,</span>
<span class="s0">when Dolokhov, meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I</span>
<span class="s0">was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence. At</span>
<span class="s0">the time I gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that</span>
<span class="s0">meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter</span>
<span class="s0">replies. I recollected myself and drove away that thought only when</span>
<span class="s0">I found myself glowing with anger, but I did not sufficiently</span>
<span class="s0">repent. Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy came and began relating various</span>
<span class="s0">adventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I said something</span>
<span class="s0">disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much that was</span>
<span class="s0">unpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I recollected</span>
<span class="s0">myself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with him</span>
<span class="s0">at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so</span>
<span class="s0">become much worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on</span>
<span class="s0">the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his</span>
<span class="s0">presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave so that he too</span>
<span class="s0">may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I</span>
<span class="s0">clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, &quot;Thy day!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded</span>
<span class="s0">by dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my</span>
<span class="s0">left thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it</span>
<span class="s0">with my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger</span>
<span class="s0">one, began biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the</span>
<span class="s0">bigger and heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking</span>
<span class="s0">my arm, led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a</span>
<span class="s0">narrow plank. I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to</span>
<span class="s0">clamber up a fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After</span>
<span class="s0">much effort I dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one</span>
<span class="s0">side and my body on the other. I looked round and saw Brother A.</span>
<span class="s0">standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden,</span>
<span class="s0">and in the garden was a large and beautiful building. I woke up. O</span>
<span class="s0">Lord, great Architect of Nature, help me to tear from myself these</span>
<span class="s0">dogs--my passions especially the last, which unites in itself the</span>
<span class="s0">strength of all the former ones, and aid me to enter that temple of</span>
<span class="s0">virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream.</span>


<span class="s0">7th December</span>

<span class="s0">I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house, and that I</span>
<span class="s0">was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered</span>
<span class="s0">incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this</span>
<span class="s0">could not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace</span>
<span class="s0">him. But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and</span>
<span class="s0">grown young, and he was quietly telling me something about the</span>
<span class="s0">teaching of our order, but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened. We</span>
<span class="s0">were sitting or lying on the floor. He was telling me something, and I</span>
<span class="s0">wished to show him my sensibility, and not listening to what he was</span>
<span class="s0">saying I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and</span>
<span class="s0">the grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and I</span>
<span class="s0">was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation and jumped</span>
<span class="s0">up, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he</span>
<span class="s0">had been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a</span>
<span class="s0">kind look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where</span>
<span class="s0">there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with</span>
<span class="s0">longing to caress him and lie down too. And he said, &quot;Tell me</span>
<span class="s0">frankly what is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think you</span>
<span class="s0">know it already.&quot; Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was</span>
<span class="s0">my chief temptation. He shook his head incredulously; and even more</span>
<span class="s0">abashed, I said that though I was living with my wife as he advised, I</span>
<span class="s0">was not living with her as her husband. To this he replied that one</span>
<span class="s0">should not deprive a wife of one's embraces and gave me to</span>
<span class="s0">understand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should be</span>
<span class="s0">ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and</span>
<span class="s0">found in my mind the text from the Gospel: &quot;The life was the light</span>
<span class="s0">of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness</span>
<span class="s0">comprehended it not.&quot; Joseph Alexeevich's face had looked young and</span>
<span class="s0">bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he</span>
<span class="s0">wrote about &quot;conjugal duties.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">9th December</span>

<span class="s0">I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw</span>
<span class="s0">that I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and</span>
<span class="s0">Joseph Alexeevich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at</span>
<span class="s0">once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in</span>
<span class="s0">him, and I rushed to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands,</span>
<span class="s0">and he said, &quot;Hast thou noticed that my face is different?&quot; I looked</span>
<span class="s0">at him, still holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young,</span>
<span class="s0">but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite</span>
<span class="s0">changed. And I said, &quot;I should have known you had I met you by</span>
<span class="s0">chance,&quot; and I thought to myself, &quot;Am I telling the truth?&quot; And</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered</span>
<span class="s0">and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of</span>
<span class="s0">drawing paper; I said, &quot;I drew that,&quot; and he answered by bowing his</span>
<span class="s0">head. I opened the book, and on all the pages there were excellent</span>
<span class="s0">drawings. And in my dream I knew that these drawings represented the</span>
<span class="s0">love adventures of the soul with its beloved. And on its pages I saw a</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and</span>
<span class="s0">with a transparent body, flying up to the clouds. And I seemed to know</span>
<span class="s0">that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the Song of</span>
<span class="s0">Songs. And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt that I was doing</span>
<span class="s0">wrong, but could not tear myself away from them. Lord, help me! My</span>
<span class="s0">God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but if I am</span>
<span class="s0">myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall perish of my</span>
<span class="s0">debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">The Rostovs' monetary affairs had not improved during the two</span>
<span class="s0">years they had spent in the country.</span>

<span class="s0">Though Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was</span>
<span class="s0">still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending</span>
<span class="s0">comparatively little, the way of life at Otradnoe--Mitenka's</span>
<span class="s0">management of affairs, in particular--was such that the debts</span>
<span class="s0">inevitably increased every year. The only resource obviously</span>
<span class="s0">presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official</span>
<span class="s0">post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he</span>
<span class="s0">said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vera and was</span>
<span class="s0">accepted.</span>

<span class="s0">Though in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society without</span>
<span class="s0">themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they</span>
<span class="s0">were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.</span>

<span class="s0">The Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country</span>
<span class="s0">neighbors from Otradnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,</span>
<span class="s0">Peronskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bezukhov, and the son of their</span>
<span class="s0">district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the</span>
<span class="s0">men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostovs' house in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg were Boris, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and</span>
<span class="s0">dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">and paid the eldest daughter, Countess Vera, the attentions a young</span>
<span class="s0">man pays when he intends to propose.</span>

<span class="s0">Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at</span>
<span class="s0">Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He</span>
<span class="s0">narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air</span>
<span class="s0">that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he</span>
<span class="s0">had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.</span>

<span class="s0">In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had</span>
<span class="s0">picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp</span>
<span class="s0">standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his</span>
<span class="s0">commander. Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this</span>
<span class="s0">occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again</span>
<span class="s0">believed it had been necessary to do this, and he received two</span>
<span class="s0">decorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in</span>
<span class="s0">the Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg.</span>

<span class="s0">Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg's merits, it could not</span>
<span class="s0">be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent</span>
<span class="s0">terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant</span>
<span class="s0">career before him and an assured position in society.</span>

<span class="s0">Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow theater, Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him and had</span>
<span class="s0">said in German, &quot;das soll mein Weib werden,&quot;* and from that moment had</span>
<span class="s0">made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs' position and his own, he decided that the time had come</span>
<span class="s0">to propose.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;That girl shall be my wife.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Berg's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not</span>
<span class="s0">flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an</span>
<span class="s0">obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess</span>
<span class="s0">Rostova; but Berg's chief characteristic was such a naive and good</span>
<span class="s0">natured egotism that the Rostovs involuntarily came to think it</span>
<span class="s0">would be a good thing, since he himself was so firmly convinced that</span>
<span class="s0">it was good, indeed excellent. Moreover, the Rostovs' affairs were</span>
<span class="s0">seriously embarrassed, as the suitor could not but know; and above</span>
<span class="s0">all, Vera was twenty-four, had been taken out everywhere, and though</span>
<span class="s0">she was certainly good-looking and sensible, no one up to now had</span>
<span class="s0">proposed to her. So they gave their consent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see,&quot; said Berg to his comrade, whom he called &quot;friend&quot; only</span>
<span class="s0">because he knew that everyone has friends, &quot;you see, I have considered</span>
<span class="s0">it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if</span>
<span class="s0">it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and</span>
<span class="s0">mamma are now provided for--I have arranged that rent for them in</span>
<span class="s0">the Baltic Provinces--and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with</span>
<span class="s0">her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not</span>
<span class="s0">marrying for money--I consider that dishonorable--but a wife should</span>
<span class="s0">bring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the</span>
<span class="s0">service, she has connections and some means. In our times that is</span>
<span class="s0">worth something, isn't it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable</span>
<span class="s0">girl, and she loves me...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Berg blushed and smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.</span>
<span class="s0">Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite</span>
<span class="s0">different--an unpleasant character and has not the same</span>
<span class="s0">intelligence. She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my</span>
<span class="s0">fiancee!... Well, you will be coming,&quot; he was going to say, &quot;to dine,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">but changed his mind and said &quot;to take tea with us,&quot; and quickly</span>
<span class="s0">doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke,</span>
<span class="s0">perfectly embodying his dream of happiness.</span>

<span class="s0">After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by</span>
<span class="s0">Berg's proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times</span>
<span class="s0">took possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and</span>
<span class="s0">insincere. In the family's feeling toward this wedding a certain</span>
<span class="s0">awkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not</span>
<span class="s0">having loved Vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off</span>
<span class="s0">their hands. The old count felt this most. He would probably have been</span>
<span class="s0">unable to state the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from</span>
<span class="s0">the state of his affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what</span>
<span class="s0">his debts amounted to, or what dowry he could give Vera. When his</span>
<span class="s0">daughters were born he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an</span>
<span class="s0">estate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had</span>
<span class="s0">already been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so</span>
<span class="s0">much in arrears that it would have to be sold, so that it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to give it to Vera. Nor had he any money.</span>

<span class="s0">Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained</span>
<span class="s0">before the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own</span>
<span class="s0">mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At</span>
<span class="s0">one time the count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of</span>
<span class="s0">selling a forest, at another time of borrowing money on a note of</span>
<span class="s0">hand. A few days before the wedding Berg entered the count's study</span>
<span class="s0">early one morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his</span>
<span class="s0">future father-in-law to let him know what Vera's dowry would be. The</span>
<span class="s0">count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without</span>
<span class="s0">consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head. &quot;I like</span>
<span class="s0">your being businesslike about it.... I like it. You shall be</span>
<span class="s0">satisfied....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the</span>
<span class="s0">conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did</span>
<span class="s0">not know for certain how much Vera would have and did not receive at</span>
<span class="s0">least part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters</span>
<span class="s0">off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because, consider, Count--if I allowed myself to marry now</span>
<span class="s0">without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be</span>
<span class="s0">acting badly....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and</span>
<span class="s0">to avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand</span>
<span class="s0">for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on</span>
<span class="s0">the shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty</span>
<span class="s0">thousand in ready money. &quot;Or at least twenty thousand, Count,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">added, &quot;and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, all right!&quot; said the count hurriedly. &quot;Only excuse me, my</span>

<span class="s0">dear fellow, I'll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for</span>
<span class="s0">eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">Natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which</span>
<span class="s0">she had counted on her fingers with Boris after they had kissed four</span>
<span class="s0">years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before Sonya and her</span>
<span class="s0">mother, if Boris happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of</span>
<span class="s0">that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not</span>
<span class="s0">worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question</span>
<span class="s0">whether her engagement to Boris was a jest or an important, binding</span>
<span class="s0">promise tormented her.</span>

<span class="s0">Since Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had had not seen</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed</span>
<span class="s0">near Otradnoe, but had never been to see them.</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes it occurred to Natasha that he not wish to see her, and</span>
<span class="s0">this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders</span>
<span class="s0">spoke of him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nowadays old friends are not remembered,&quot; the countess would say</span>
<span class="s0">when Boris was mentioned.</span>

<span class="s0">Anna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently,</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke</span>
<span class="s0">rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant career on which he had entered. When the Rostovs came to</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg Boris called on them.</span>

<span class="s0">He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natasha was</span>
<span class="s0">his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of</span>
<span class="s0">letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between</span>
<span class="s0">himself and Natasha could not be binding either on her or on him. He</span>
<span class="s0">had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with</span>
<span class="s0">Countess Bezukhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to</span>
<span class="s0">the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he</span>
<span class="s0">enjoyed, and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the</span>
<span class="s0">richest heiresses in Petersburg, plans which might very easily be</span>
<span class="s0">realized. When he entered the Rostovs' drawing room Natasha was in her</span>
<span class="s0">own room. When she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the</span>
<span class="s0">drawing room, flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris remembered Natasha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining</span>
<span class="s0">from under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had</span>
<span class="s0">known her four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a</span>
<span class="s0">different Natasha entered, and his face expressed rapturous</span>
<span class="s0">astonishment. This expression on his face pleased Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?&quot; asked the</span>
<span class="s0">countess.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris kissed Natasha's hand and said that he was astonished at the</span>
<span class="s0">change in her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How handsome you have grown!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I should think so!&quot; replied Natasha's laughing eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And is Papa older?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha sat down and, without joining in Boris' conversation with</span>
<span class="s0">the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood's suitor. He</span>
<span class="s0">felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced</span>
<span class="s0">at her occasionally.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris' uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were</span>
<span class="s0">all comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natasha noticed at</span>
<span class="s0">once. He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess,</span>
<span class="s0">arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his</span>
<span class="s0">left hand like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined</span>
<span class="s0">compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg</span>
<span class="s0">society, recalling with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances. It was not accidentally, Natasha felt, that he alluded,</span>
<span class="s0">when speaking of the highest aristocracy, to an ambassador's ball he</span>
<span class="s0">had attended, and to invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.</span>

<span class="s0">All this time Natasha sat silent, glancing up at him from under</span>
<span class="s0">her brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Boris more and more. He</span>
<span class="s0">looked round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he</span>
<span class="s0">was saying. He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and</span>
<span class="s0">took his leave. The same inquisitive, challenging, and rather</span>
<span class="s0">mocking eyes still looked at him. After his first visit Boris said</span>
<span class="s0">to himself that Natasha attracted him just as much as ever, but that</span>
<span class="s0">he must not yield to that feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost</span>
<span class="s0">without fortune, would mean ruin to his career, while to renew their</span>
<span class="s0">former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable.</span>
<span class="s0">Boris made up his mind to avoid meeting Natasha, but despite that</span>
<span class="s0">resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often</span>
<span class="s0">and spending whole days at the Rostovs'. It seemed to him that he</span>
<span class="s0">ought to have an explanation with Natasha and tell her that the old</span>
<span class="s0">times must be forgotten, that in spite of everything... she could</span>
<span class="s0">not be his wife, that he had no means, and they would never let her</span>
<span class="s0">marry him. But he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on</span>
<span class="s0">such an explanation. From day to day he became more and more</span>
<span class="s0">entangled. It seemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in</span>
<span class="s0">love with Boris as of old. She sang him his favorite songs, showed him</span>
<span class="s0">her album, making him write in it, did not allow him to allude to</span>
<span class="s0">the past, letting it be understood how was the present; and every</span>
<span class="s0">day he went away in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and</span>
<span class="s0">not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end.</span>
<span class="s0">He left off visiting Helene and received reproachful notes from her</span>
<span class="s0">every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,</span>
<span class="s0">without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing</span>
<span class="s0">under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and</span>
<span class="s0">bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Natasha, also</span>
<span class="s0">in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in</span>
<span class="s0">curlpapers, ran in. The countess--her prayerful mood dispelled--looked</span>
<span class="s0">round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: &quot;Can it be</span>
<span class="s0">that this couch will be my grave?&quot; Natasha, flushed and eager,</span>
<span class="s0">seeing her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down,</span>
<span class="s0">and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing</span>
<span class="s0">that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and,</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her</span>
<span class="s0">slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might</span>
<span class="s0">become her grave. This couch was high, with a feather bed and five</span>
<span class="s0">pillows each smaller than the one below. Natasha jumped on it, sank</span>
<span class="s0">into the feather bed, rolled over to the wall, and began snuggling</span>
<span class="s0">up the bedclothes as she settled down, raising her knees to her</span>
<span class="s0">chin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly, now covering</span>
<span class="s0">herself up head and all, and now peeping at her mother. The countess</span>
<span class="s0">finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face, but</span>
<span class="s0">seeing, that Natasha's head was covered, she smiled in her kind,</span>
<span class="s0">weak way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, now then!&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Now, just one on</span>
<span class="s0">your throat and another... that'll do!&quot; And seizing her mother round</span>
<span class="s0">the neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her</span>
<span class="s0">mother Natasha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that</span>
<span class="s0">however she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without</span>
<span class="s0">hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what is it tonight?&quot; said the mother, having arranged her</span>
<span class="s0">pillows and waited until Natasha, after turning over a couple of</span>
<span class="s0">times, had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her</span>
<span class="s0">arms, and assumed a serious expression.</span>

<span class="s0">These visits of Natasha's at night before the count returned from</span>
<span class="s0">his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and</span>
<span class="s0">daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it tonight?--But I have to tell you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha put her hand on her mother's mouth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;About Boris... I know,&quot; she said seriously; &quot;that's what I have</span>
<span class="s0">come about. Don't say it--I know. No, do tell me!&quot; and she removed her</span>
<span class="s0">hand. &quot;Tell me, Mamma! He's nice?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say</span>
<span class="s0">Boris is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what</span>
<span class="s0">then?... What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his</span>
<span class="s0">head, I can see that....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the</span>
<span class="s0">mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the</span>
<span class="s0">countess only saw her daughter's face in profile. That face struck her</span>
<span class="s0">by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was listening and considering.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what then?&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him?</span>
<span class="s0">You know you can't marry him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why not?&quot; said Natasha, without changing her position.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a</span>
<span class="s0">relation... and because you yourself don't love him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know. It is not right, darling!&quot;</span>

 <span class="s0">&quot;But if I want to...&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Leave off talking nonsense,&quot; said the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But if I want to...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, I am in earnest...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha did not let her finish. She drew the countess' large hand to</span>
<span class="s0">her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned</span>
<span class="s0">it over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between</span>
<span class="s0">the knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, &quot;January, February,</span>
<span class="s0">March, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don't you say anything? Speak!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her</span>
<span class="s0">daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she</span>
<span class="s0">had wished to say.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It won't do, my love! Not everyone will understand this</span>
<span class="s0">friendship dating from your childish days, and to see him so</span>
<span class="s0">intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who</span>
<span class="s0">visit us, and above all it torments him for nothing. He may already</span>
<span class="s0">have found a suitable and wealthy match, and now he's half crazy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Crazy?&quot; repeated Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know! Cyril Matveich... but he is old.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He was not always old. But this is what I'll do, Natasha, I'll have</span>
<span class="s0">a talk with Boris. He need not come so often....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why not, if he likes to?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because I know it will end in nothing....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can you know? No, Mamma, don't speak to him! What nonsense!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. &quot;Well,</span>
<span class="s0">I won't marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha smiled and looked at her mother. &quot;Not to marry, but just</span>
<span class="s0">so,&quot; she added.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How so, my pet?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just so. There's no need for me to marry him. But... just so.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just so, just so,&quot; repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she</span>
<span class="s0">went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't laugh, stop!&quot; cried Natasha. &quot;You're shaking the whole bed!</span>
<span class="s0">You're awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...&quot; and she</span>
<span class="s0">seized the countess' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little</span>
<span class="s0">finger, saying, &quot;June,&quot; and continued, kissing, &quot;July, August,&quot; on the</span>
<span class="s0">other hand. &quot;But, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you think?</span>
<span class="s0">Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And he's very nice, very,</span>
<span class="s0">very nice. Only not quite my taste--he is so narrow, like the</span>
<span class="s0">dining-room clock.... Don't you understand? Narrow, you know--gray,</span>
<span class="s0">light gray...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What rubbish you're talking!&quot; said the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha continued: &quot;Don't you really understand? Nicholas would</span>
<span class="s0">understand.... Bezukhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is</span>
<span class="s0">square.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You flirt with him too,&quot; said the countess, laughing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue</span>
<span class="s0">and red.... How can I explain it to you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Little countess!&quot; the count's voice called from behind the door.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;You're not asleep?&quot; Natasha jumped up, snatched up her slippers,</span>
<span class="s0">and ran barefoot to her own room.</span>

<span class="s0">It was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no</span>
<span class="s0">one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya?&quot; she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little</span>
<span class="s0">kitten with her enormous plait of hair. &quot;No, how could she? She's</span>
<span class="s0">virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know</span>
<span class="s0">anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how</span>
<span class="s0">clever I am and how... charming she is,&quot; she went on, speaking of</span>
<span class="s0">herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise</span>
<span class="s0">man--the wisest and best of men--who was saying it of her. &quot;There is</span>
<span class="s0">everything, everything in her,&quot; continued this man. &quot;She is</span>
<span class="s0">unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty,</span>
<span class="s0">uncommonly pretty, and agile--she swims and rides splendidly... and</span>
<span class="s0">her voice! One can really say it's a wonderful voice!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw</span>
<span class="s0">herself on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would</span>
<span class="s0">immediately fall asleep, called Dunyasha the maid to put out the</span>
<span class="s0">candle, and before Dunyasha had left the room had already passed</span>
<span class="s0">into yet another happier world of dreams, where everything was as</span>
<span class="s0">light and beautiful as in reality, and even more so because it was</span>
<span class="s0">different.</span>


<span class="s0">Next day the countess called Boris aside and had a talk with him,</span>
<span class="s0">after which he ceased coming to the Rostovs'.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">On the thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, 1809 --10 an old</span>
<span class="s0">grandee of Catherine's day was giving a ball and midnight supper.</span>
<span class="s0">The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.</span>

<span class="s0">The grandee's well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered</span>
<span class="s0">with innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit</span>
<span class="s0">entrance which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but</span>
<span class="s0">dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood</span>
<span class="s0">at the porch. Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving,</span>
<span class="s0">with red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the</span>
<span class="s0">carriages emerged men wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while</span>
<span class="s0">ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps</span>
<span class="s0">which were let down for them with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly</span>
<span class="s0">and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance.</span>

<span class="s0">Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through</span>
<span class="s0">the crowd and caps were doffed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor?... No, a minister.... prince... ambassador. Don't</span>
<span class="s0">you see the plumes?...&quot; was whispered among the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone</span>
<span class="s0">and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.</span>

<span class="s0">A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostovs, who</span>
<span class="s0">were to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.</span>

<span class="s0">There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostov family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive,</span>
<span class="s0">that the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be</span>
<span class="s0">arranged as it should be.</span>

<span class="s0">Marya Ignatevna Peronskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at</span>
<span class="s0">the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the</span>
<span class="s0">countess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg high</span>
<span class="s0">society, was to accompany them to the ball.</span>

<span class="s0">They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten</span>
<span class="s0">o'clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were</span>
<span class="s0">not yet dressed.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight</span>
<span class="s0">that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all</span>
<span class="s0">day. All her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring</span>
<span class="s0">that they all--she herself, Mamma, and Sonya--should be as well</span>
<span class="s0">dressed as possible. Sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in</span>
<span class="s0">her hands. The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and</span>
<span class="s0">the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their</span>
<span class="s0">bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque.</span>

<span class="s0">Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks,</span>
<span class="s0">and ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the</span>
<span class="s0">openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were</span>
<span class="s0">already on; the hairdressing was almost done. Sonya was finishing</span>
<span class="s0">dressing and so was the countess, but Natasha, who had bustled about</span>
<span class="s0">helping them all, was behindhand. She was still sitting before a</span>
<span class="s0">looking-glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders. Sonya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and,</span>
<span class="s0">pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger, was</span>
<span class="s0">fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's not the way, that's not the way, Sonya!&quot; cried Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the</span>
<span class="s0">maid who was dressing it had not time to release. &quot;That bow is not</span>
<span class="s0">right. Come here!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya sat down and Natasha pinned the ribbon on differently.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Allow me, Miss! I can't do it like that,&quot; said the maid who was</span>
<span class="s0">holding Natasha's hair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That's right, Sonya.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Aren't you ready? It is nearly ten,&quot; came the countess' voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have only my cap to pin on.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't do it without me!&quot; called Natasha. &quot;You won't do it right.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it's already ten.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They had decided to be at the ball by half past ten, and Natasha had</span>
<span class="s0">still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.</span>

<span class="s0">When her hair was done, Natasha, in her short petticoat from under</span>
<span class="s0">which her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother's dressing jacket,</span>
<span class="s0">ran up to Sonya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother.</span>
<span class="s0">Turning her mother's head this way and that, she fastened on the cap</span>
<span class="s0">and, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were</span>
<span class="s0">turning up the hem of her skirt.</span>

<span class="s0">The cause of the delay was Natasha's skirt, which was too long.</span>
<span class="s0">Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of</span>
<span class="s0">thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the</span>
<span class="s0">countess and Sonya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer</span>
<span class="s0">garment up high on one uplifted hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mavra, quicker, darling!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give me my thimble, Miss, from there...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whenever will you be ready?&quot; asked the count coming to the door.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Here is here is some scent. Peronskaya must be tired of waiting.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's ready, Miss,&quot; said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze</span>
<span class="s0">dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as</span>
<span class="s0">if by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of</span>
<span class="s0">what she held.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha began putting on the dress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In a minute! In a minute! Don't come in, Papa!&quot; she cried to her</span>
<span class="s0">father as he opened the door--speaking from under the filmy skirt</span>
<span class="s0">which still covered her whole face.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in.</span>
<span class="s0">He was wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and</span>
<span class="s0">was perfumed and his hair pomaded.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!&quot; cried Natasha, as she stood</span>
<span class="s0">in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If you please, Miss! allow me,&quot; said the maid, who on her knees was</span>
<span class="s0">pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of</span>
<span class="s0">her mouth to the other with her tongue.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Say what you like,&quot; exclaimed Sonya, in a despairing voice as she</span>
<span class="s0">looked at Natasha, &quot;say what you like, it's still too long.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress</span>
<span class="s0">was too long.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Really, madam, it is not at all too long,&quot; said Mavra, crawling</span>
<span class="s0">on her knees after her young lady.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, if it's too long we'll take it up... we'll tack it up in</span>
<span class="s0">one minute,&quot; said the resolute Dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck</span>
<span class="s0">on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set</span>
<span class="s0">to work once more.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in</span>
<span class="s0">her cap and velvet gown.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oo-oo, my beauty!&quot; exclaimed the count, &quot;she looks better than</span>
<span class="s0">any of you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside</span>
<span class="s0">fearing to be rumpled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, your cap, more to this side,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;I'll arrange</span>
<span class="s0">it,&quot; and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up</span>
<span class="s0">her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn</span>
<span class="s0">off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Never mind, I'll run it up, it won't show,&quot; said Dunyasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a beauty--a very queen!&quot; said the nurse as she came to the</span>
<span class="s0">door. &quot;And Sonya! They are lovely!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and</span>
<span class="s0">started. But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.</span>

<span class="s0">Peronskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she</span>
<span class="s0">had gone through the same process as the Rostovs, but with less</span>
<span class="s0">flurry--for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was</span>
<span class="s0">washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed</span>
<span class="s0">behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her</span>
<span class="s0">old lady's maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">servants had been.</span>

<span class="s0">She praised the Rostovs' toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,</span>
<span class="s0">and at eleven o'clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they</span>
<span class="s0">settled themselves in their carriages and drove off.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not</span>
<span class="s0">once had time to think of what lay before her.</span>

<span class="s0">In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage,</span>
<span class="s0">she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her</span>
<span class="s0">there at the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms--with music,</span>
<span class="s0">flowers, dances, the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg. The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it</span>
<span class="s0">would come true, so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness</span>
<span class="s0">and closeness of the carriage. She understood all that awaited her</span>
<span class="s0">only when, after stepping over the red baize at the entrance, she</span>
<span class="s0">entered the hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside Sonya and in</span>
<span class="s0">front of her mother, mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between</span>
<span class="s0">the flowers. Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball,</span>
<span class="s0">and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable</span>
<span class="s0">for a girl on such an occasion. But, fortunately for her, she felt her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes growing misty, she saw nothing clearly, her pulse beat a</span>
<span class="s0">hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed at her heart. She</span>
<span class="s0">could not assume that pose, which would have made her ridiculous,</span>
<span class="s0">and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all</span>
<span class="s0">her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that became</span>
<span class="s0">her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering, also</span>
<span class="s0">talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the</span>
<span class="s0">landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with</span>
<span class="s0">diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her</span>
<span class="s0">reflection from the others. All was blended into one brilliant</span>
<span class="s0">procession. On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices,</span>
<span class="s0">footsteps, and greetings deafened Natasha, and the light and glitter</span>
<span class="s0">dazzled her still more. The host and hostess, who had already been</span>
<span class="s0">standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to</span>
<span class="s0">the various arrivals, &quot;Charme de vous voir,&quot;* greeted the Rostovs</span>
<span class="s0">and Peronskaya in the same manner.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Delighted to see you.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her</span>
<span class="s0">black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess' eye</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natasha. She looked at her and</span>
<span class="s0">gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as</span>
<span class="s0">hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden,</span>
<span class="s0">irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The</span>
<span class="s0">host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was</span>
<span class="s0">his daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Charming!&quot; said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.</span>

<span class="s0">In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front</span>
<span class="s0">rows of that crowd. Natasha heard and felt that several people were</span>
<span class="s0">asking about her and looking at her. She realized that those</span>
<span class="s0">noticing her liked her, and this observation helped to calm her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There are some like ourselves and some worse,&quot; she thought.</span>

<span class="s0">Peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important</span>
<span class="s0">people at the ball.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray</span>
<span class="s0">curly hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he</span>
<span class="s0">said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezukhova,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Peronskaya, indicating Helene who had just entered. &quot;How lovely! She</span>
<span class="s0">is quite equal to Marya Antonovna. See how the men, young and old, pay</span>
<span class="s0">court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince--is quite mad</span>
<span class="s0">about her. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even</span>
<span class="s0">more run after.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very</span>
<span class="s0">plain daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She is a splendid match, a millionairess,&quot; said Peronskaya. &quot;And</span>
<span class="s0">look, here come her suitors.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is Bezukhova's brother, Anatole Kuragin,&quot; she said, indicating</span>
<span class="s0">a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head</span>
<span class="s0">erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies. &quot;He's</span>
<span class="s0">handsome, isn't he? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl.</span>
<span class="s0">But your cousin, Drubetskoy, is also very attentive to her. They say</span>
<span class="s0">she has millions. Oh yes, that's the French ambassador himself!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">replied to the countess' inquiry about Caulaincourt. &quot;Looks as if he</span>
<span class="s0">were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.</span>
<span class="s0">No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still</span>
<span class="s0">the most beautiful of them all, our Marya Antonovna! And how simply</span>
<span class="s0">she is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the</span>
<span class="s0">universal Freemason,&quot; she went on, indicating Pierre. &quot;Put him</span>
<span class="s0">beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly</span>
<span class="s0">as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently looking for someone.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, &quot;the</span>
<span class="s0">buffoon,&quot; as Peronskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for</span>
<span class="s0">them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and</span>
<span class="s0">introduce partners to her.</span>

<span class="s0">But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome,</span>
<span class="s0">dark man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a</span>
<span class="s0">window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natasha at</span>
<span class="s0">once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it</span>
<span class="s0">was Bolkonski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger,</span>
<span class="s0">happier, and better-looking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There's someone else we know--Bolkonski, do you see, Mamma?&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, pointing out Prince Andrew. &quot;You remember, he stayed a</span>
<span class="s0">night with us at Otradnoe.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, you know him?&quot; said Peronskaya. &quot;I can't bear him. Il fait a</span>
<span class="s0">present la pluie et le beau temps.* He's too proud for anything.</span>
<span class="s0">Takes after his father. And he's hand in glove with Speranski, writing</span>
<span class="s0">some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There's one</span>
<span class="s0">talking to him and he has turned away,&quot; she said, pointing at him.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I'd give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;He is all the rage just now.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and</span>
<span class="s0">then back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up.</span>
<span class="s0">Behind him walked his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing</span>
<span class="s0">to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the</span>
<span class="s0">reception over. The band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on</span>
<span class="s0">account of the words that had been set to it, beginning: &quot;Alexander,</span>
<span class="s0">Elisaveta, all our hearts you ravish quite...&quot; The Emperor passed on</span>
<span class="s0">to the drawing room, the crowd made a rush for the doors, and</span>
<span class="s0">several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again.</span>
<span class="s0">Then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing-room door, at which</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor reappeared talking to the hostess. A young man, looking</span>
<span class="s0">distraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking them to move aside.</span>
<span class="s0">Some ladies, with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the</span>
<span class="s0">rules of decorum, pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets.</span>
<span class="s0">The men began to choose partners and take their places for the</span>
<span class="s0">polonaise.</span>

<span class="s0">Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the</span>
<span class="s0">music. The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina; then came</span>
<span class="s0">ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Peronskaya</span>
<span class="s0">diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners and</span>
<span class="s0">were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the</span>
<span class="s0">polonaise. Natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not</span>
<span class="s0">having been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms</span>
<span class="s0">hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly,</span>
<span class="s0">and with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight</span>
<span class="s0">before her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She</span>
<span class="s0">was not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people</span>
<span class="s0">whom Peronskaya was pointing out--she had but one thought: &quot;Is it</span>
<span class="s0">possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to</span>
<span class="s0">dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?</span>
<span class="s0">They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they</span>
<span class="s0">were saying, 'Ah, she's not the one I'm after, so it's not worth</span>
<span class="s0">looking at her!' No, it's impossible,&quot; she thought. &quot;They must know</span>
<span class="s0">how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would</span>
<span class="s0">enjoy dancing with me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable</span>
<span class="s0">time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha's ears.</span>
<span class="s0">She wanted to cry. Peronskaya had left them. The count was at the</span>
<span class="s0">other end of the room. She and the countess and Sonya were standing by</span>
<span class="s0">themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of</span>
<span class="s0">strangers, with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone.</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them.</span>
<span class="s0">The handsome Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and</span>
<span class="s0">looked at Natasha as one looks at a wall. Boris passed them twice</span>
<span class="s0">and each time turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing,</span>
<span class="s0">came up to them.</span>

<span class="s0">This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natasha--as if there</span>
<span class="s0">were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did</span>
<span class="s0">not listen to or look at Vera, who was telling her something about her</span>
<span class="s0">own green dress.</span>

<span class="s0">At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced</span>
<span class="s0">with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they</span>
<span class="s0">were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the</span>
<span class="s0">distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had</span>
<span class="s0">yet begun dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went</span>
<span class="s0">up to Countess Bezukhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly</span>
<span class="s0">raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him.</span>
<span class="s0">The aide-de-camp, an adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly</span>
<span class="s0">round her waist, with confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding</span>
<span class="s0">first round the edge of the circle, then at the corner of the room</span>
<span class="s0">he caught Helene's left hand and turned her, the only sound audible,</span>
<span class="s0">apart from the ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of</span>
<span class="s0">the spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his</span>
<span class="s0">partner's velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled</span>
<span class="s0">round. Natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not</span>
<span class="s0">she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing</span>
<span class="s0">stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in</span>
<span class="s0">the front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs. Baron Firhoff</span>
<span class="s0">was talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State</span>
<span class="s0">to be held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission,</span>
<span class="s0">could give reliable information about that sitting, concerning which</span>
<span class="s0">various rumors were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was</span>
<span class="s0">saying, he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men</span>
<span class="s0">intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the</span>
<span class="s0">circle.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to</span>
<span class="s0">dance.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You always dance. I have a protegee, the young Rostova, here. Ask</span>
<span class="s0">her,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is she?&quot; asked Bolkonski. &quot;Excuse me!&quot; he added, turning to</span>
<span class="s0">the baron, &quot;we will finish this conversation elsewhere--at a ball</span>
<span class="s0">one must dance.&quot; He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.</span>
<span class="s0">The despairing, dejected expression of Natasha's face caught his</span>
<span class="s0">eye. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her</span>
<span class="s0">debut, remembered her conversation at the window, and with an</span>
<span class="s0">expression of pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostova.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Allow me to introduce you to my daughter,&quot; said the countess,</span>
<span class="s0">with heightened color.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess</span>
<span class="s0">remembers me,&quot; said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite</span>
<span class="s0">belying Peronskaya's remarks about his rudeness, and approaching</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed</span>
<span class="s0">his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have long been waiting for you,&quot; that frightened happy little</span>
<span class="s0">girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as</span>
<span class="s0">she raised her hand to Prince Andrew's shoulder. They were the</span>
<span class="s0">second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best</span>
<span class="s0">dancers of his day and Natasha danced exquisitely. Her little feet</span>
<span class="s0">in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly,</span>
<span class="s0">and independently of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic</span>
<span class="s0">happiness. Her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful--compared</span>
<span class="s0">to Helene's her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But</span>
<span class="s0">Helene seemed, as it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands</span>
<span class="s0">of looks that had scanned her person, while Natasha was like a girl</span>
<span class="s0">exposed for the first time, who would have felt very much ashamed</span>
<span class="s0">had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as</span>
<span class="s0">possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed</span>
<span class="s0">to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he</span>
<span class="s0">disliked, caused by the Emperor's presence, he danced, and had</span>
<span class="s0">chosen Natasha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she</span>
<span class="s0">was the first pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he</span>
<span class="s0">embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close</span>
<span class="s0">to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to</span>
<span class="s0">his head, and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after</span>
<span class="s0">leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">After Prince Andrew, Boris came up to ask Natasha for dance, and</span>
<span class="s0">then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young</span>
<span class="s0">men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous</span>
<span class="s0">partners to Sonya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She</span>
<span class="s0">noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did</span>
<span class="s0">she fail to notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French</span>
<span class="s0">ambassador, and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or</span>
<span class="s0">that Prince So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and</span>
<span class="s0">that Helene had great success and was honored was by the special</span>
<span class="s0">attention of So-and-so, but she did not even see the Emperor, and only</span>
<span class="s0">noticed that he had gone because the ball became livelier after his</span>
<span class="s0">departure. For one of the merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">was again her partner. He reminded her of their first encounter in the</span>
<span class="s0">Otradnoe avenue, and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight</span>
<span class="s0">night, and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself, as if</span>
<span class="s0">there had been something to be ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had</span>
<span class="s0">overheard.</span>

<span class="s0">Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked</span>
<span class="s0">meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And</span>
<span class="s0">such was Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and</span>
<span class="s0">even her mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special</span>
<span class="s0">care and tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest</span>
<span class="s0">and most unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the</span>
<span class="s0">middle of the cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">still out of breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer</span>
<span class="s0">chose her. She was tired and panting and evidently thought of</span>
<span class="s0">declining, but immediately put her hand gaily on the man's shoulder,</span>
<span class="s0">smiling at Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'd be glad to sit beside you and rest: I'm tired; but you see</span>
<span class="s0">how they keep asking me, and I'm glad of it, I'm happy and I love</span>
<span class="s0">everybody, and you and I understand it all,&quot; and much, much more was</span>
<span class="s0">said in her smile. When her partner left her Natasha ran across the</span>
<span class="s0">room to choose two ladies for the figure.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she</span>
<span class="s0">will be my wife,&quot; said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own</span>
<span class="s0">surprise, as he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What rubbish sometimes enters one's head!&quot; thought Prince Andrew,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;but what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,</span>
<span class="s0">that she won't be dancing here a month before she will be</span>
<span class="s0">married.... Such as she are rare here,&quot; he thought, as Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself</span>
<span class="s0">beside him.</span>

<span class="s0">When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up</span>
<span class="s0">to the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and</span>
<span class="s0">asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natasha did not</span>
<span class="s0">answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said</span>
<span class="s0">reproachfully: &quot;How can you ask such a question?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have never enjoyed myself so much before!&quot; she said, and Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her</span>
<span class="s0">father and instantly dropped again. Natasha was happier than she had</span>
<span class="s0">ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one</span>
<span class="s0">becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the</span>
<span class="s0">possibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.</span>

<span class="s0">At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the</span>
<span class="s0">position his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and</span>
<span class="s0">absent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing</span>
<span class="s0">by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one.</span>

<span class="s0">On her way to supper Natasha passed him.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of</span>
<span class="s0">him. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of</span>
<span class="s0">her own happiness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How delightful it is, Count!&quot; said she. &quot;Isn't it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I am very glad,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can people be dissatisfied with anything?&quot; thought Natasha.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Especially such a capital fellow as Bezukhov!&quot; In Natasha's eyes</span>
<span class="s0">all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people,</span>
<span class="s0">loving one another; none of them capable of injuring another--and so</span>
<span class="s0">they ought all to be happy.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not</span>
<span class="s0">dwell on it long. &quot;Yes, it was a very brilliant ball,&quot; and then...</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, that little Rostova is very charming. There's something fresh,</span>
<span class="s0">original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.&quot; That</span>
<span class="s0">was all he thought about yesterday's ball, and after his morning tea</span>
<span class="s0">he set to work.</span>

<span class="s0">But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for</span>
<span class="s0">work and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work,</span>
<span class="s0">as he often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.</span>

<span class="s0">The visitor was Bitski, who served on various committees, frequented</span>
<span class="s0">all the societies in Petersburg, and a passionate devotee of the new</span>
<span class="s0">ideas and of Speranski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger--one of</span>
<span class="s0">those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to</span>
<span class="s0">the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest</span>
<span class="s0">partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking.</span>
<span class="s0">He had just heard particulars of that morning's sitting of the Council</span>
<span class="s0">of State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically.</span>
<span class="s0">The Emperor's speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such</span>
<span class="s0">as only constitutional monarchs deliver. &quot;The Sovereign plainly said</span>
<span class="s0">that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the</span>
<span class="s0">government must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts</span>
<span class="s0">published,&quot; recounted Bitski, emphasizing certain words and opening</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes significantly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, yes! Today's events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our</span>
<span class="s0">history,&quot; he concluded.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the</span>
<span class="s0">Council of State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which</span>
<span class="s0">he had attached such importance, and was surprised that this event,</span>
<span class="s0">now that it had taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite</span>
<span class="s0">insignificant. He listened with quiet irony to Bitski's enthusiastic</span>
<span class="s0">account of it. A very simple thought occurred to him: &quot;What does it</span>
<span class="s0">matter to me or to Bitski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the</span>
<span class="s0">Council? Can all that make me any happier or better?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to</span>
<span class="s0">dine that evening at Speranski's, &quot;with only a few friends,&quot; as the</span>
<span class="s0">host had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the</span>
<span class="s0">intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his</span>
<span class="s0">domestic surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.</span>

<span class="s0">At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room</span>
<span class="s0">this small house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting</span>
<span class="s0">that of a monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the</span>
<span class="s0">friendly gathering of Speranski's intimate acquaintances already</span>
<span class="s0">assembled at five o'clock. There were no ladies present except</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski's little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her</span>
<span class="s0">governess. The other guests were Gervais, Magnitski, and Stolypin.</span>
<span class="s0">While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a</span>
<span class="s0">ringing staccato laugh--a laugh such as one hears on the stage.</span>
<span class="s0">Someone--it sounded like Speranski--was distinctly ejaculating</span>
<span class="s0">ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard Speranski's famous</span>
<span class="s0">laugh, and this ringing, high pitched laughter from a statesman made a</span>
<span class="s0">strange impression on him.</span>

<span class="s0">He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing</span>
<span class="s0">between two windows at a small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres.</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast,</span>
<span class="s0">and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had</span>
<span class="s0">worn at the meeting of the Council of State, stood at the table with a</span>
<span class="s0">beaming countenance. His guests surrounded him. Magnitski,</span>
<span class="s0">addressing himself to Speranski, was relating an anecdote, and</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski was laughing in advance at what Magnitski was going to</span>
<span class="s0">say. When Prince Andrew entered the room Magnitski's words were</span>
<span class="s0">again crowned by laughter. Stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he</span>
<span class="s0">munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed softly with a</span>
<span class="s0">hissing chuckle, and Speranski in a high-pitched staccato manner.</span>

<span class="s0">Still laughing, Speranski held out his soft white hand to Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very pleased to see you, Prince,&quot; he said. &quot;One moment...&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">went on, turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story. &quot;We have</span>
<span class="s0">agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about</span>
<span class="s0">business!&quot; and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment,</span>
<span class="s0">regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared</span>
<span class="s0">mysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and</span>
<span class="s0">unattractive.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before</span>
<span class="s0">Magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate</span>
<span class="s0">something still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the</span>
<span class="s0">state service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in</span>
<span class="s0">this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely</span>
<span class="s0">accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good</span>
<span class="s0">humored ridicule. Speranski related how at the Council that morning</span>
<span class="s0">a deaf dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so</span>
<span class="s0">too. Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable</span>
<span class="s0">for the stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolypin, stuttering,</span>
<span class="s0">broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the</span>
<span class="s0">abuses that existed under the former order of things--threatening to</span>
<span class="s0">give a serious turn to the conversation. Magnitski starting quizzing</span>
<span class="s0">Stolypin about his vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and</span>
<span class="s0">the talk reverted to its former lively tone.</span>

<span class="s0">Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find</span>
<span class="s0">amusement in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his</span>
<span class="s0">wish, tried to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speranski's</span>
<span class="s0">high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter</span>
<span class="s0">grated on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and</span>
<span class="s0">feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company, but no</span>
<span class="s0">one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood.</span>
<span class="s0">They all seemed very gay.</span>

<span class="s0">He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his</span>
<span class="s0">remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the</span>
<span class="s0">water, and he could not jest with them.</span>

<span class="s0">There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was</span>
<span class="s0">witty and might have been funny, but it lacked just that something</span>
<span class="s0">which is the salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a</span>
<span class="s0">thing existed.</span>

<span class="s0">After dinner Speranski's daughter and her governess rose. He</span>
<span class="s0">patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that</span>
<span class="s0">gesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">The men remained at table over their port--English fashion. In the</span>
<span class="s0">midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon's Spanish</span>
<span class="s0">affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to</span>
<span class="s0">express a contrary opinion. Speranski smiled and, with an evident wish</span>
<span class="s0">to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a</span>
<span class="s0">story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few</span>
<span class="s0">moments all were silent.</span>

<span class="s0">Having sat some time at table, Speranski corked a bottle of wine</span>
<span class="s0">and, remarking, &quot;Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">passed it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk</span>
<span class="s0">loudly went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier</span>
<span class="s0">were handed to Speranski and he took them to his study. As soon as</span>
<span class="s0">he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests</span>
<span class="s0">began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now for the recitation!&quot; said Speranski on returning from his</span>
<span class="s0">study. &quot;A wonderful talent!&quot; he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnitski</span>
<span class="s0">immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses</span>
<span class="s0">in French which he had composed about various well-known Petersburg</span>
<span class="s0">people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When the</span>
<span class="s0">verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Speranski and took his</span>
<span class="s0">leave.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where are you off to so early?&quot; asked Speranski.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I promised to go to a reception.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those</span>
<span class="s0">mirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of</span>
<span class="s0">him to have expected anything from Speranski and from any of his own</span>
<span class="s0">activities connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance</span>
<span class="s0">to what Speranski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang</span>
<span class="s0">in Prince Andrew's ears long after he had left the house.</span>

<span class="s0">When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something</span>
<span class="s0">new. He recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of</span>
<span class="s0">his project of army reform, which had been accepted for</span>
<span class="s0">consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence</span>
<span class="s0">simply because another, a very poor one, had already been prepared and</span>
<span class="s0">submitted to the Emperor. He thought of the meetings of a committee of</span>
<span class="s0">which Berg was a member. He remembered how carefully and at what</span>
<span class="s0">length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at</span>
<span class="s0">those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that related to</span>
<span class="s0">the gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on the</span>
<span class="s0">Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of</span>
<span class="s0">the Roman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of</span>
<span class="s0">himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself Bogucharovo, his</span>
<span class="s0">occupations in the country, his journey to Ryazan; he remembered the</span>
<span class="s0">peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally applying to them the</span>
<span class="s0">Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he felt astonished</span>
<span class="s0">that he could have spent so much time on such useless work.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited</span>
<span class="s0">before, and among them at the Rostovs' with whom he had renewed</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintance at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness</span>
<span class="s0">which demanded the call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl</span>
<span class="s0">who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a</span>
<span class="s0">dark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier</span>
<span class="s0">than in her ball dress. She and all the Rostov family welcomed him</span>
<span class="s0">as an old friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he</span>
<span class="s0">had formerly judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of</span>
<span class="s0">excellent, simple, and kindly people. The old count's hospitality</span>
<span class="s0">and good nature, which struck one especially in Petersburg as a</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant surprise, were such that Prince Andrew could not refuse to</span>
<span class="s0">stay to dinner. &quot;Yes,&quot; he thought, &quot;they are capital people, who of</span>
<span class="s0">course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting</span>
<span class="s0">for this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely</span>
<span class="s0">alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,</span>
<span class="s0">that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had</span>
<span class="s0">already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no</span>
<span class="s0">longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered</span>
<span class="s0">it found in it a new enjoyment.</span>

<span class="s0">After dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrew's request, went to the</span>
<span class="s0">clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window</span>
<span class="s0">talking to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he</span>
<span class="s0">ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had</span>
<span class="s0">thought impossible for him. He looked at Natasha as she sang, and</span>
<span class="s0">something new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the</span>
<span class="s0">same time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was</span>
<span class="s0">ready to weep. What about? His former love? The little princess? His</span>
<span class="s0">disillusionments?... His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The</span>
<span class="s0">chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the terrible contrast</span>
<span class="s0">between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that</span>
<span class="s0">limited and material something that he, and even she, was. This</span>
<span class="s0">contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as Natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how</span>
<span class="s0">he liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling</span>
<span class="s0">that she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and</span>
<span class="s0">said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew left the Rostovs' late in the evening. He went to</span>
<span class="s0">bed from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having</span>
<span class="s0">lit his candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again</span>
<span class="s0">not at all troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and</span>
<span class="s0">joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into God's own</span>
<span class="s0">fresh air. It did not enter his head that he was in love with Natasha;</span>
<span class="s0">he was not thinking about her, but only picturing her to himself,</span>
<span class="s0">and in consequence all life appeared in a new light. &quot;Why do I strive,</span>
<span class="s0">why do I toil in this narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with</span>
<span class="s0">all its joys, is open to me?&quot; said he to himself. And for the first</span>
<span class="s0">time for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future.</span>
<span class="s0">He decided that he must attend to his son's education by finding a</span>
<span class="s0">tutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire</span>
<span class="s0">from the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and</span>
<span class="s0">Italy. &quot;I must use my freedom while I feel so much strength and</span>
<span class="s0">youth in me,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Pierre was right when he said one</span>
<span class="s0">must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and</span>
<span class="s0">now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead, but while one</span>
<span class="s0">has life one must live and be happy!&quot; thought he.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XX</span>


<span class="s0">One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an</span>
<span class="s0">immaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed</span>
<span class="s0">forward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately</span>
<span class="s0">she could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more</span>
<span class="s0">fortunate with you,&quot; he said with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count&quot; (Berg said this</span>
<span class="s0">with perfect conviction that this information could not but be</span>
<span class="s0">agreeable), &quot;and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own</span>
<span class="s0">and my wife's friends.&quot; (He smiled still more pleasantly.) &quot;I wished</span>
<span class="s0">to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to</span>
<span class="s0">supper.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Only Countess Helene, considering the society of such people as</span>
<span class="s0">the Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an</span>
<span class="s0">invitation. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at</span>
<span class="s0">his house a small but select company, and why this would give him</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure, and why though he grudged spending money on cards or</span>
<span class="s0">anything harmful, he was prepared to run into some expense for the</span>
<span class="s0">sake of good society--that Pierre could not refuse, and promised to</span>
<span class="s0">come.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But don't be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten</span>
<span class="s0">minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is</span>
<span class="s0">coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you</span>
<span class="s0">will do me the favor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at</span>
<span class="s0">the Bergs' house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.</span>

<span class="s0">Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were</span>
<span class="s0">ready for their guests' arrival.</span>

<span class="s0">In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and</span>
<span class="s0">pictures and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely</span>
<span class="s0">buttoned up in his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to</span>
<span class="s0">her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above</span>
<span class="s0">one, because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I</span>
<span class="s0">managed from my first promotion.&quot; (Berg measured his life not by years</span>
<span class="s0">but by promotions.) &quot;My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only</span>
<span class="s0">waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to</span>
<span class="s0">be your husband.&quot; (He rose and kissed Vera's hand, and on the way to</span>
<span class="s0">her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) &quot;And how</span>
<span class="s0">have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my</span>
<span class="s0">aquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious</span>
<span class="s0">and methodical.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and</span>
<span class="s0">paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak</span>
<span class="s0">woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man's dignity,</span>
<span class="s0">what it was ein Mann zu sein.* Vera at the same time smiling with a</span>
<span class="s0">sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the</span>
<span class="s0">same understood life wrongly, as according to Vera all men did.</span>
<span class="s0">Berg, judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. Vera,</span>
<span class="s0">judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation,</span>
<span class="s0">supposed that all men, though they understand nothing and are</span>
<span class="s0">conceited and selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.</span>


<span class="s0">*To be a man.</span>


<span class="s0">Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her</span>
<span class="s0">lace fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on</span>
<span class="s0">the lips.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The only thing is, we mustn't have children too soon,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Vera, &quot;I don't at all want that. We must live for</span>
<span class="s0">society.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this,&quot; said Berg,</span>
<span class="s0">pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.</span>

<span class="s0">Just then Count Bezukhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced</span>
<span class="s0">at one another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally</span>
<span class="s0">claiming the honor of this visit.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is what what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">thought Berg. &quot;This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But please don't interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Vera, &quot;because I know what interests each of them and what to say</span>
<span class="s0">to different people.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Berg smiled again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It can't be helped: men must sometimes have masculine</span>
<span class="s0">conversation,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">They received Pierre in their small, new drawing-room, where it</span>
<span class="s0">was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,</span>
<span class="s0">neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange</span>
<span class="s0">that Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an</span>
<span class="s0">armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently</span>
<span class="s0">painfully undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor</span>
<span class="s0">to settle the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry</span>
<span class="s0">by moving a chair for himself, and Berg and Vera immediately began</span>
<span class="s0">their evening party, interrupting each other in their efforts to</span>
<span class="s0">entertain their guest.</span>

<span class="s0">Vera, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be</span>
<span class="s0">entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once</span>
<span class="s0">began accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation</span>
<span class="s0">was required, interrupted his wife's remarks and touched on the</span>
<span class="s0">question of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the</span>
<span class="s0">general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made</span>
<span class="s0">him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had</span>
<span class="s0">declined them. Though the conversation was very incoherent and Vera</span>
<span class="s0">was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element, both husband</span>
<span class="s0">and wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only one guest was</span>
<span class="s0">present, their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas</span>
<span class="s0">to every other evening party with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.</span>

<span class="s0">Before long Boris, Berg's old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of</span>
<span class="s0">condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vera. After</span>
<span class="s0">Boris came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other</span>
<span class="s0">evening parties. Berg and Vera could not repress their smiles of</span>
<span class="s0">satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room, at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of</span>
<span class="s0">dresses, and the bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody</span>
<span class="s0">always has it, especially so the general, who admired the apartment,</span>
<span class="s0">patted Berg on the shoulder, and with parental authority superintended</span>
<span class="s0">the setting out of the table for boston. The general sat down by Count</span>
<span class="s0">Ilya Rostov, who was next to himself the most important guest. The old</span>
<span class="s0">people sat with the old, the young with the young, and the hostess</span>
<span class="s0">at the tea table, on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a</span>
<span class="s0">silver cake basket as the Panins had at their party. Everything was</span>
<span class="s0">just as it was everywhere else.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXI</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston</span>
<span class="s0">with Count Rostov, the general, and the colonel. At the card table</span>
<span class="s0">he happened to be directly facing Natasha, and was struck by a curious</span>
<span class="s0">change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and</span>
<span class="s0">not only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from</span>
<span class="s0">plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's the matter with her?&quot; thought Pierre, glancing at her. She</span>
<span class="s0">was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without</span>
<span class="s0">looking at him, made some reply to Boris who sat down beside her.</span>
<span class="s0">After playing out a whole suit and to his partner's delight taking</span>
<span class="s0">five tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who</span>
<span class="s0">had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again</span>
<span class="s0">at Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What has happened to her?&quot; he asked himself with still greater</span>
<span class="s0">surprise.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her</span>
<span class="s0">with a look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was</span>
<span class="s0">looking up at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid</span>
<span class="s0">breathing. And the bright glow of some inner fire that had been</span>
<span class="s0">suppressed was again alight in her. She was completely transformed and</span>
<span class="s0">from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and</span>
<span class="s0">youthful expression in his friend's face.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now</span>
<span class="s0">with his back to Natasha and now facing her, but during the whole of</span>
<span class="s0">the six rubbers he watched her and his friend.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Something very important is happening between them,&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him</span>
<span class="s0">and made him neglect the game.</span>

<span class="s0">After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use</span>
<span class="s0">playing like that, and Pierre was released. Natasha on one side was</span>
<span class="s0">talking with Sonya and Boris, and Vera with a subtle smile was</span>
<span class="s0">saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and,</span>
<span class="s0">asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them.</span>
<span class="s0">Vera, having noticed Prince Andrew's attentions to Natasha, decided</span>
<span class="s0">that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the</span>
<span class="s0">tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about</span>
<span class="s0">feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest</span>
<span class="s0">as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ</span>
<span class="s0">her diplomatic tact.</span>

<span class="s0">When Pierre went up to them he noticed that Vera was being carried</span>
<span class="s0">away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed</span>
<span class="s0">embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What do you think?&quot; Vera was saying with an arch smile. &quot;You are so</span>
<span class="s0">discerning, Prince, and understand people's characters so well at a</span>
<span class="s0">glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her</span>
<span class="s0">attachments? Could she, like other women&quot; (Vera meant herself),</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;love a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is</span>
<span class="s0">what I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know your sister too little,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, with a</span>
<span class="s0">sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, &quot;to</span>
<span class="s0">be able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed</span>
<span class="s0">that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to</span>
<span class="s0">be,&quot; he added, and looked up Pierre who was just approaching them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days,&quot; continued Vera--mentioning</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;our days&quot; as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing,</span>
<span class="s0">imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;our days&quot; and that human characteristics change with the times--&quot;in</span>
<span class="s0">our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted</span>
<span class="s0">often stifles real feeling in her. And it must be confessed that</span>
<span class="s0">Natalie is very susceptible.&quot; This return to the subject of Natalie</span>
<span class="s0">caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about</span>
<span class="s0">to rise, but Vera continued with a still more subtle smile:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think no one has been more courted than she,&quot; she went on, &quot;but</span>
<span class="s0">till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you</span>
<span class="s0">know, Count,&quot; she said to Pierre, &quot;even our dear cousin Boris, who,</span>
<span class="s0">between ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are friendly with Boris, aren't you?&quot; asked Vera.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I know him...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natasha?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, there was childish love?&quot; suddenly asked Prince Andrew,</span>
<span class="s0">blushing unexpectedly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le</span>
<span class="s0">cousinage est un dangereux voisinage.* Don't you think so?&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, undoubtedly!&quot; said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural</span>
<span class="s0">liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very</span>
<span class="s0">careful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of</span>
<span class="s0">these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew</span>
<span class="s0">him aside.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well?&quot; asked Pierre, seeing his friend's strange animation with</span>
<span class="s0">surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Natasha as he rose.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I must... I must have a talk with you,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;You</span>
<span class="s0">know that pair of women's gloves?&quot; (He referred to the Masonic</span>
<span class="s0">gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he</span>
<span class="s0">loved.) &quot;I... but no, I will talk to you later on,&quot; and with a strange</span>
<span class="s0">light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">approached Natasha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.</span>

<span class="s0">But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he</span>
<span class="s0">should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on</span>
<span class="s0">the affairs in Spain.</span>

<span class="s0">Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his</span>
<span class="s0">face. The party was very successful and quite like other parties he</span>
<span class="s0">had seen. Everything was similar: the ladies' subtle talk, the</span>
<span class="s0">cards, the general raising his voice at the card table, and the</span>
<span class="s0">samovar and the tea cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had</span>
<span class="s0">always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate. They had</span>
<span class="s0">not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about</span>
<span class="s0">something important and clever. Now the general had begun such a</span>
<span class="s0">discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXII</span>


<span class="s0">Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs and spent the rest of the day there.</span>

<span class="s0">Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came,</span>
<span class="s0">and without concealing it he tried to be with Natasha all day. Not</span>
<span class="s0">only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">but in the whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something</span>
<span class="s0">important that was bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and</span>
<span class="s0">sternly serious eyes at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon</span>
<span class="s0">as he looked her way. Sonya was afraid to leave Natasha and afraid</span>
<span class="s0">of being in the way when she was with them. Natasha grew pale, in a</span>
<span class="s0">panic of expectation, when she remained alone with him for a moment.</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew surprised her by his timidity. She felt that he wanted</span>
<span class="s0">to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so.</span>

<span class="s0">In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha and whispered: &quot;Well, what?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma! For heaven's sake don't ask me anything now! One can't</span>
<span class="s0">talk about that,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">But all the same that night Natasha, now agitated and now</span>
<span class="s0">frightened, lay a long time in her mother's bed gazing straight</span>
<span class="s0">before her. She told her how he had complimented her, how he told</span>
<span class="s0">her he was going abroad, asked her where they were going to spend</span>
<span class="s0">the summer, and then how he had asked her about Boris.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But such a... such a... never happened to me before!&quot; she said.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Only I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I'm</span>
<span class="s0">with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that it's the real</span>
<span class="s0">thing? Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, my love; I am frightened myself,&quot; answered her mother. &quot;Now</span>
<span class="s0">go!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All the same I shan't sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!</span>
<span class="s0">Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before,&quot; she said,</span>
<span class="s0">surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. &quot;And</span>
<span class="s0">could we ever have thought!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It seemed to Natasha that even at the time she first saw Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew at Otradnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she</span>
<span class="s0">feared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very</span>
<span class="s0">man she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and</span>
<span class="s0">of finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg</span>
<span class="s0">while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that</span>
<span class="s0">ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!</span>
<span class="s0">Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew had written in Natasha's album.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't, Natasha! Pray to God. 'Marriages are made in heaven,'&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said her mother.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!&quot; cried Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.</span>

<span class="s0">At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and</span>
<span class="s0">telling him of his love for Natasha and his firm resolve to make her</span>
<span class="s0">his wife.</span>

<span class="s0">That day Countess Helene had a reception at her house. The French</span>
<span class="s0">ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of</span>
<span class="s0">late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies</span>
<span class="s0">and gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the</span>
<span class="s0">rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and</span>
<span class="s0">morose air.</span>

<span class="s0">Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous</span>
<span class="s0">depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the</span>
<span class="s0">intimacy of his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly</span>
<span class="s0">been made a gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had</span>
<span class="s0">begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than</span>
<span class="s0">before. At the same time the feeling he had noticed between his</span>
<span class="s0">protegee Natasha and Prince Andrew accentuated his gloom by the</span>
<span class="s0">contrast between his own position and his friend's. He tried equally</span>
<span class="s0">to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natasha and Prince Andrew;</span>
<span class="s0">and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with</span>
<span class="s0">eternity; again the question: for what? presented itself; and he</span>
<span class="s0">forced himself to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to</span>
<span class="s0">drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, after</span>
<span class="s0">he had left the countess' apartments, he was sitting upstairs in a</span>
<span class="s0">shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction of the</span>
<span class="s0">Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with</span>
<span class="s0">tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, it's you!&quot; said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And I, you see, am hard at it.&quot; He pointed to his manuscript book</span>
<span class="s0">with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy</span>
<span class="s0">people look at their work.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life</span>
<span class="s0">on his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,</span>
<span class="s0">smiled at him with the egotism of joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, dear heart,&quot; said he, &quot;I wanted to tell you about it</span>
<span class="s0">yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything</span>
<span class="s0">like it before. I am in love, my friend!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person</span>
<span class="s0">down on the sofa beside Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;With Natasha Rostova, yes?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,</span>
<span class="s0">but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and</span>
<span class="s0">suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in</span>
<span class="s0">the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can't live</span>
<span class="s0">without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why</span>
<span class="s0">don't you speak?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I? I? What did I tell you?&quot; said Pierre suddenly, rising and</span>
<span class="s0">beginning to pace up and down the room. &quot;I always thought it....</span>
<span class="s0">That girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,</span>
<span class="s0">I entreat you, don't philosophize, don't doubt, marry, marry,</span>
<span class="s0">marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what of her?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She loves you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't talk rubbish...&quot; said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She does, I know,&quot; Pierre cried fiercely.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But do listen,&quot; returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. &quot;Do</span>
<span class="s0">you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,&quot; said Pierre, and his face</span>
<span class="s0">really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a</span>
<span class="s0">different, quite a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for</span>
<span class="s0">life, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he</span>
<span class="s0">made up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in</span>
<span class="s0">his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future,</span>
<span class="s0">said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father's caprice,</span>
<span class="s0">and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this</span>
<span class="s0">marriage and love her, or would do without his consent; then he</span>
<span class="s0">marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange,</span>
<span class="s0">apart from and independent of himself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of</span>
<span class="s0">such love,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;It is not at all the same feeling</span>
<span class="s0">that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into</span>
<span class="s0">two halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the</span>
<span class="s0">other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom</span>
<span class="s0">and darkness....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Darkness and gloom,&quot; reiterated Pierre: &quot;yes, yes, I understand</span>
<span class="s0">that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very</span>
<span class="s0">happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched</span>
<span class="s0">and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew's lot</span>
<span class="s0">appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIII</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Andrew needed his father's consent to his marriage, and to</span>
<span class="s0">obtain this he started for the country next day.</span>

<span class="s0">His father received his son's communication with external composure,</span>
<span class="s0">but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to</span>
<span class="s0">alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life</span>
<span class="s0">was already ending. &quot;If only they would let me end my days as I want</span>
<span class="s0">to,&quot; thought the old man, &quot;then they might do as they please.&quot; With</span>
<span class="s0">his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for</span>
<span class="s0">important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole</span>
<span class="s0">matter.</span>

<span class="s0">In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards</span>
<span class="s0">birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young</span>
<span class="s0">as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special</span>
<span class="s0">stress on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son</span>
<span class="s0">whom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. &quot;Fourthly</span>
<span class="s0">and finally,&quot; the father said, looking ironically at his son, &quot;I beg</span>
<span class="s0">you to put it off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as</span>
<span class="s0">you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your</span>
<span class="s0">love or passion or obstinacy--as you please--is still as great, marry!</span>
<span class="s0">And that's my last word on it. Mind, the last...&quot; concluded the</span>
<span class="s0">prince, in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his</span>
<span class="s0">decision.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his</span>
<span class="s0">feelings, or his fiancee's, would not stand a year's test, or that</span>
<span class="s0">he (the old prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to</span>
<span class="s0">conform to his father's wish--to propose, and postpone the wedding for</span>
<span class="s0">a year.</span>

<span class="s0">Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostovs,</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg.</span>


<span class="s0">Next day after her talk with her mother Natasha expected Bolkonski</span>
<span class="s0">all day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the</span>
<span class="s0">same. Pierre did not come either and Natasha, not knowing that</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew had gone to see his father, could not explain his</span>
<span class="s0">absence to herself.</span>

<span class="s0">Three weeks passed in this way. Natasha had no desire to go out</span>
<span class="s0">anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and</span>
<span class="s0">listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in</span>
<span class="s0">the evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing</span>
<span class="s0">at her and pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound</span>
<span class="s0">to her vanity intensified her misery.</span>

<span class="s0">Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">began to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not</span>
<span class="s0">know why it is being punished.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess began to soothe Natasha, who after first listening to</span>
<span class="s0">her mother's words, suddenly interrupted her:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Leave off, Mamma! I don't think, and don't want to think about</span>
<span class="s0">it! He just came and then left off, left off...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and</span>
<span class="s0">went on quietly:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I don't at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I</span>
<span class="s0">have now become quite calm, quite calm.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The day after this conversation Natasha put on the old dress which</span>
<span class="s0">she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the</span>
<span class="s0">mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she</span>
<span class="s0">had abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went</span>
<span class="s0">to the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud</span>
<span class="s0">resonance, and began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished</span>
<span class="s0">her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and</span>
<span class="s0">sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her. She listened</span>
<span class="s0">joyfully (as though she had not expected it) to the charm of the notes</span>
<span class="s0">reverberating, filling the whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying</span>
<span class="s0">away; and all at once she felt cheerful. &quot;What's the good of making so</span>
<span class="s0">much of it? Things are nice as it is,&quot; she said to herself, and she</span>
<span class="s0">began walking up and down the room, not stepping simply on the</span>
<span class="s0">resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the</span>
<span class="s0">toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening to the</span>
<span class="s0">regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to</span>
<span class="s0">the sounds of her own voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;There, that's me!&quot; the expression of her face seemed to say as she</span>
<span class="s0">caught sight of herself. &quot;Well, and very nice too! I need nobody.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room</span>
<span class="s0">but she would not let him, and having closed the door behind him</span>
<span class="s0">continued her walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite</span>
<span class="s0">mood--love of, and delight in, herself. &quot;How charming that Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">is!&quot; she said again, speaking as some third, collective, male</span>
<span class="s0">person. &quot;Pretty, a good voice, young, and in nobody's way if only they</span>
<span class="s0">leave her in peace.&quot; But however much they left her in peace she could</span>
<span class="s0">not now be at peace, and immediately felt this.</span>

<span class="s0">In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, &quot;At home?&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">then footsteps were heard. Natasha was looking at the mirror, but</span>
<span class="s0">did not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When</span>
<span class="s0">she saw herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for</span>
<span class="s0">certain, though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.</span>

<span class="s0">Pale and agitated, Natasha ran into the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma! Bolkonski has come!&quot; she said. &quot;Mamma, it is awful, it is</span>
<span class="s0">unbearable! I don't want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room</span>
<span class="s0">with an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natasha his</span>
<span class="s0">face brightened. He kissed the countess' hand and Natasha's, and sat</span>
<span class="s0">down beside the sofa.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is long since we had the pleasure...&quot; began the countess, but</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,</span>
<span class="s0">obviously in haste to say what he had to.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have not been to see all this time because I have been at my</span>
<span class="s0">father's. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I</span>
<span class="s0">only got back last night,&quot; he said glancing at Natasha; &quot;I want to</span>
<span class="s0">have a talk with you, Countess,&quot; he added after a moment's pause.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am at your disposal,&quot; she murmured.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:</span>
<span class="s0">something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared</span>
<span class="s0">straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At once? This instant!... No, it can't be!&quot; she thought.</span>

<span class="s0">Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she</span>
<span class="s0">was not mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be</span>
<span class="s0">decided.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go, Natasha! I will call you,&quot; said the countess in a whisper.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">and at her mother and went out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter's hand,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess' face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your offer...&quot; she began at last sedately. He remained silent,</span>
<span class="s0">looking into her eyes. &quot;Your offer...&quot; (she grew confused) &quot;is</span>
<span class="s0">agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband...</span>
<span class="s0">I hope... but it will depend on her....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it</span>
<span class="s0">to me?&quot; said Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and</span>
<span class="s0">with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips</span>
<span class="s0">to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him</span>
<span class="s0">as a son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I am sure my husband will consent,&quot; said the countess, &quot;but your</span>
<span class="s0">father...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express</span>
<span class="s0">condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a</span>
<span class="s0">year. And I wished to tell you of that,&quot; said Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is true that Natasha is still young, but--so long as that?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is unavoidable,&quot; said Prince Andrew with a sigh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will send her to you,&quot; said the countess, and left the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lord have mercy upon us!&quot; she repeated while seeking her daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom. Natasha was sitting on</span>
<span class="s0">the bed, pale and dry eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering</span>
<span class="s0">something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped</span>
<span class="s0">up and flew to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Mamma?... Well?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,&quot; said the countess,</span>
<span class="s0">coldly it seemed to Natasha. &quot;Go... go,&quot; said the mother, sadly and</span>
<span class="s0">reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When</span>
<span class="s0">she came in and saw him she paused. &quot;Is it possible that this stranger</span>
<span class="s0">has now become everything to me?&quot; she asked herself, and immediately</span>
<span class="s0">answered, &quot;Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than</span>
<span class="s0">everything in the world.&quot; Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast</span>
<span class="s0">eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned</span>
<span class="s0">expression of her face. Her face said: &quot;Why ask? Why doubt what you</span>
<span class="s0">cannot but know? Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you love me?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; Natasha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed</span>
<span class="s0">loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it? What's the matter?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I am so happy!&quot; she replied, smiled through her tears, bent</span>
<span class="s0">over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether</span>
<span class="s0">she might, and then kissed him.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find</span>
<span class="s0">in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of</span>
<span class="s0">desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness,</span>
<span class="s0">fear at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful</span>
<span class="s0">sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present</span>
<span class="s0">feeling, though not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger</span>
<span class="s0">and more serious.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it possible that I--the 'chit of a girl,' as everybody called</span>
<span class="s0">me,&quot; thought Natasha--&quot;is it possible that I am now to be the wife and</span>
<span class="s0">the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father</span>
<span class="s0">looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no</span>
<span class="s0">more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies</span>
<span class="s0">a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he</span>
<span class="s0">ask me?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; she replied, but she had not understood his question.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive me!&quot; he said. &quot;But you are so young, and I have already</span>
<span class="s0">been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know</span>
<span class="s0">yourself.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing</span>
<span class="s0">to take in the meaning of his words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,&quot; continued</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, &quot;it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask</span>
<span class="s0">you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall</span>
<span class="s0">remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or</span>
<span class="s0">should you come to love...&quot; said Prince Andrew with an unnatural</span>
<span class="s0">smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Natasha interrupted him. &quot;You know that</span>
<span class="s0">from the very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In a year you will learn to know yourself....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A whole year!&quot; Natasha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that</span>
<span class="s0">the marriage was to be postponed for a year. &quot;But why a year? Why a</span>
<span class="s0">year?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha did not hear him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And can't it be helped?&quot; she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,</span>
<span class="s0">but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's awful! Oh, it's awful! awful!&quot; Natasha suddenly cried, and</span>
<span class="s0">again burst into sobs. &quot;I shall die, waiting a year: it's</span>
<span class="s0">impossible, it's awful!&quot; She looked into her lover's face and saw in</span>
<span class="s0">it a look of commiseration and perplexity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, no! I'll do anything!&quot; she said, suddenly checking her tears.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I am so happy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed</span>
<span class="s0">couple their blessing.</span>

<span class="s0">From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostovs' as</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's affianced lover.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIV</span>

<span class="s0">No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha's engagement to</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said</span>
<span class="s0">that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole</span>
<span class="s0">burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever,</span>
<span class="s0">but that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom.</span>
<span class="s0">If after six months she felt that she did not love him she would</span>
<span class="s0">have full right to reject him. Naturally neither Natasha nor her</span>
<span class="s0">parents wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came</span>
<span class="s0">every day to the Rostovs', but did not behave to Natasha as an</span>
<span class="s0">affianced lover: he did not use the familiar thou, but said you to</span>
<span class="s0">her, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement, quite</span>
<span class="s0">different, intimate, and natural relations sprang up between them.</span>
<span class="s0">It was as if they had not known each other till now. Both liked to</span>
<span class="s0">recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were</span>
<span class="s0">nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite different</span>
<span class="s0">beings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere. At first</span>
<span class="s0">the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew;</span>
<span class="s0">he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all</span>
<span class="s0">that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all of</span>
<span class="s0">them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to</span>
<span class="s0">be. After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without</span>
<span class="s0">restraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he</span>
<span class="s0">took his part. He could talk about rural economy with the count,</span>
<span class="s0">fashions with the countess and Natasha, and about albums and fancywork</span>
<span class="s0">with Sonya. Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his</span>
<span class="s0">presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the</span>
<span class="s0">evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew's coming to Otradnoe</span>
<span class="s0">and their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents</span>
<span class="s0">betokening that it had to be.</span>

<span class="s0">In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always</span>
<span class="s0">accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting</span>
<span class="s0">together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and</span>
<span class="s0">go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely</span>
<span class="s0">spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to</span>
<span class="s0">speak of it. Natasha shared this as she did all his feelings, which</span>
<span class="s0">she constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his</span>
<span class="s0">son. Prince Andrew blushed, as he often did now--Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">particularly liked it in him--and said that his son would not live</span>
<span class="s0">with them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Natasha in a frightened tone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How I should have loved him!&quot; said Natasha, immediately guessing</span>
<span class="s0">his thought; &quot;but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding</span>
<span class="s0">fault with us.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask</span>
<span class="s0">his advice about Petya's education or Nicholas' service. The old</span>
<span class="s0">countess sighed as she looked at them; Sonya was always getting</span>
<span class="s0">frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for</span>
<span class="s0">leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">spoke (he could tell a story very well), Natasha listened to him</span>
<span class="s0">with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed</span>
<span class="s0">attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in</span>
<span class="s0">perplexity: &quot;What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover</span>
<span class="s0">something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic</span>
<span class="s0">of her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned</span>
<span class="s0">himself entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always</span>
<span class="s0">felt nearer to him. Natasha would have been completely happy if the</span>
<span class="s0">thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not</span>
<span class="s0">terrified her, just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and</span>
<span class="s0">cold.</span>

<span class="s0">On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought</span>
<span class="s0">with him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostovs' once since the ball.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the</span>
<span class="s0">countess, and Natasha sat down beside a little chess table with Sonya,</span>
<span class="s0">thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have known Bezukhov a long time?&quot; he asked. &quot;Do you like him?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he's a dear, but very absurd.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of</span>
<span class="s0">his absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known</span>
<span class="s0">him from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew said with sudden seriousness--&quot;I am going away and</span>
<span class="s0">heaven knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know</span>
<span class="s0">I am not to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when</span>
<span class="s0">I am not here...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What can happen?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whatever trouble may come,&quot; Prince Andrew continued, &quot;I beg you,</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for</span>
<span class="s0">advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but</span>
<span class="s0">he has a heart of gold.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Neither her father, nor her mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would</span>
<span class="s0">act on Natasha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that</span>
<span class="s0">day, dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not</span>
<span class="s0">understanding what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking</span>
<span class="s0">leave, he kissed her hand for the last time. &quot;Don't go!&quot; she said in a</span>
<span class="s0">tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and</span>
<span class="s0">which he remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone;</span>
<span class="s0">but for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no</span>
<span class="s0">interest in anything and only saying now and then, &quot;Oh, why did he</span>
<span class="s0">go away?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around</span>
<span class="s0">her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and</span>
<span class="s0">became her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy,</span>
<span class="s0">as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of</span>
<span class="s0">face.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXV</span>


<span class="s0">During that year after his son's departure, Prince Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski's health and temper became much worse. He grew still more</span>
<span class="s0">irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of</span>
<span class="s0">his frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out</span>
<span class="s0">her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary had two passions and consequently two joys--her</span>
<span class="s0">nephew, little Nicholas, and religion--and these were the favorite</span>
<span class="s0">subjects of the prince's attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken</span>
<span class="s0">of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or</span>
<span class="s0">the petting and spoiling of children. &quot;You want to make him&quot;--little</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas--&quot;into an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants</span>
<span class="s0">a son and not an old maid,&quot; he would say. Or, turning to</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary's presence</span>
<span class="s0">how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.</span>

<span class="s0">He continually hurt Princess Mary's feelings and tormented her,</span>
<span class="s0">but it cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame</span>
<span class="s0">toward her, or could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of</span>
<span class="s0">it all, be unjust? And what is justice? The princess never thought</span>
<span class="s0">of that proud word &quot;justice.&quot; All the complex laws of man centered for</span>
<span class="s0">her in one clear and simple law--the law of love and self-sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">taught us by Him who lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself</span>
<span class="s0">was God. What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other</span>
<span class="s0">people? She had to endure and love, and that she did.</span>

<span class="s0">During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had</span>
<span class="s0">been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known</span>
<span class="s0">him for a long time past. She felt that something had happened to him,</span>
<span class="s0">but he said nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a</span>
<span class="s0">long talk with his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed</span>
<span class="s0">that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend</span>
<span class="s0">Julie Karagina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls</span>
<span class="s0">dream) of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in</span>
<span class="s0">mourning for her own brother, killed in Turkey.</span>


<span class="s0">Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.</span>

<span class="s0">Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a</span>
<span class="s0">special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and</span>
<span class="s0">your excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone,</span>
<span class="s0">can--I will not say comfort us--but save us from despair. Religion</span>
<span class="s0">alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend:</span>
<span class="s0">why, for what cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in</span>
<span class="s0">life--not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of</span>
<span class="s0">others--are called away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons,</span>
<span class="s0">or such as are a burden to themselves and to others, are left</span>
<span class="s0">living. The first death I saw, and one I shall never forget--that of</span>
<span class="s0">my dear sister-in-law--left that impression on me. Just as you ask</span>
<span class="s0">destiny why your splendid brother had to die, so I asked why that</span>
<span class="s0">angel Lise, who not only never wronged anyone, but in whose soul there</span>
<span class="s0">were never any unkind thoughts, had to die. And what do you think,</span>
<span class="s0">dear friend? Five years have passed since then, and already I, with my</span>
<span class="s0">petty understanding, begin to see clearly why she had to die, and in</span>
<span class="s0">what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness</span>
<span class="s0">of the Creator, whose every action, though generally</span>
<span class="s0">incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite love</span>
<span class="s0">for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically</span>
<span class="s0">innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother's duties. As a</span>
<span class="s0">young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been</span>
<span class="s0">so as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably</span>
<span class="s0">she will there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not</span>
<span class="s0">to speak of her alone, that early and terrible death has had the</span>
<span class="s0">most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all</span>
<span class="s0">our grief. Then, at the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not</span>
<span class="s0">occur to me; I should then have dismissed them with horror, but now</span>
<span class="s0">they are very clear and certain. I write all this to you, dear friend,</span>
<span class="s0">only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a</span>
<span class="s0">principle of life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without</span>
<span class="s0">His will. And His will is governed only by infinite love for us, and</span>
<span class="s0">so whatever befalls us is for our good.</span>

<span class="s0">You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my</span>
<span class="s0">wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You</span>
<span class="s0">will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte!</span>
<span class="s0">The case is this: my father's health is growing noticeably worse, he</span>
<span class="s0">cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This</span>
<span class="s0">irritability is, as you know, chiefly directed to political questions.</span>
<span class="s0">He cannot endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal</span>
<span class="s0">terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own,</span>
<span class="s0">the grandson of the Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite</span>
<span class="s0">indifferent to politics, but from my father's remarks and his talks</span>
<span class="s0">with Michael Ivanovich I know all that goes on in the world and</span>
<span class="s0">especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who only at</span>
<span class="s0">Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a great</span>
<span class="s0">man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand this.</span>
<span class="s0">It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views</span>
<span class="s0">that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he</span>
<span class="s0">foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing</span>
<span class="s0">his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive</span>
<span class="s0">from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes</span>
<span class="s0">about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will be</span>
<span class="s0">decided very shortly.</span>

<span class="s0">Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much</span>
<span class="s0">of late. After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his</span>
<span class="s0">spirits. He has again become as I used to know him when a child: kind,</span>
<span class="s0">affectionate, with that heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has</span>
<span class="s0">realized, it seems to me, that life is not over for him. But</span>
<span class="s0">together with this mental change he has grown physically much</span>
<span class="s0">weaker. He has become thinner and more nervous. I am anxious about him</span>
<span class="s0">and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended</span>
<span class="s0">long ago. I hope it will cure him. You write that in Petersburg he</span>
<span class="s0">is spoken of as one of the most active, cultivated, and capable of the</span>
<span class="s0">young men. Forgive my vanity as a relation, but I never doubted it.</span>
<span class="s0">The good he has done to everybody here, from his peasants up to the</span>
<span class="s0">gentry, is incalculable. On his arrival in Petersburg he received only</span>
<span class="s0">his due. I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, especially such false ones as that you write about--I mean the</span>
<span class="s0">report of my brother's betrothal to the little Rostova. I do not think</span>
<span class="s0">my brother will ever marry again, and certainly not her; and this is</span>
<span class="s0">why: first, I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he</span>
<span class="s0">has lost, the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for</span>
<span class="s0">him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a</span>
<span class="s0">stepmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that girl is not the</span>
<span class="s0">kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew. I do not think he would</span>
<span class="s0">choose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish it. But I am</span>
<span class="s0">running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet. Good-by,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty care. My</span>
<span class="s0">dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.</span>

<span class="s0">MARY</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVI</span>


<span class="s0">In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected</span>
<span class="s0">letter from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her</span>
<span class="s0">strange and surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha Rostova. The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his</span>
<span class="s0">betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister. He</span>
<span class="s0">wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he</span>
<span class="s0">understand and know what life was. He asked his sister to forgive</span>
<span class="s0">him for not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited</span>
<span class="s0">Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his father. He had not</span>
<span class="s0">done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her father to give his</span>
<span class="s0">consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his</span>
<span class="s0">displeasure without attaining her object. &quot;Besides,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the</span>
<span class="s0">matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now. My father then</span>
<span class="s0">insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months, half of that</span>
<span class="s0">period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever. If the</span>
<span class="s0">doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia,</span>
<span class="s0">but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You know</span>
<span class="s0">me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have</span>
<span class="s0">been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and</span>
<span class="s0">arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a</span>
<span class="s0">short time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him</span>
<span class="s0">about the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand</span>
<span class="s0">him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and</span>
<span class="s0">whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four</span>
<span class="s0">months.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave</span>
<span class="s0">the letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her</span>
<span class="s0">quietly:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won't</span>
<span class="s0">be long--I shall soon set him free.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her</span>
<span class="s0">speak and, raising his voice more and more, cried:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,</span>
<span class="s0">eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell</span>
<span class="s0">him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas' stepmother and I'll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He</span>
<span class="s0">mustn't be without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more</span>
<span class="s0">women are wanted in my house--let him marry and live by himself.</span>
<span class="s0">Perhaps you will go and live with him too?&quot; he added, turning to</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary. &quot;Go in heavens name! Go out into the frost... the</span>
<span class="s0">frost... the frost!</span>

<span class="s0">After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the</span>
<span class="s0">matter. But repressed vexation at his son's poor-spirited behavior</span>
<span class="s0">found expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former</span>
<span class="s0">pretexts for irony a fresh one was now added--allusions to stepmothers</span>
<span class="s0">and amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why shouldn't I marry her?&quot; he asked his daughter. &quot;She'll make a</span>
<span class="s0">splendid princess!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">noticed that her father was really associating more and more with</span>
<span class="s0">the Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his</span>
<span class="s0">letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to</span>
<span class="s0">the idea.</span>

<span class="s0">Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and</span>
<span class="s0">religion were Princess Mary's joys and consolations; but besides that,</span>
<span class="s0">since everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the</span>
<span class="s0">profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that</span>
<span class="s0">supplied the chief consolation of her life. This comforting dream</span>
<span class="s0">and hope were given her by God's folk--the half-witted and other</span>
<span class="s0">pilgrims who visited her without the prince's knowledge. The longer</span>
<span class="s0">she lived, the more experience and observation she had of life, the</span>
<span class="s0">greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness of men who seek</span>
<span class="s0">enjoyment and happiness here on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling,</span>
<span class="s0">and harming one another, to obtain that impossible, visionary,</span>
<span class="s0">sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that</span>
<span class="s0">was not enough: he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman.</span>
<span class="s0">Her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and</span>
<span class="s0">wealthier match for Andrew. And they all struggled and suffered and</span>
<span class="s0">tormented one another and injured their souls, their eternal souls,</span>
<span class="s0">for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant. Not</span>
<span class="s0">only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came</span>
<span class="s0">down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is</span>
<span class="s0">a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;How is it that no one realizes this?&quot; thought Princess Mary. &quot;No</span>
<span class="s0">one except these despised God's folk who, wallet on back, come to me</span>
<span class="s0">by the back door, afraid of being seen by the prince, not for fear</span>
<span class="s0">of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him to sin. To leave</span>
<span class="s0">family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in order without</span>
<span class="s0">clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place</span>
<span class="s0">under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for all-</span>
<span class="s0">for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one:</span>
<span class="s0">higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty</span>
<span class="s0">called Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot</span>
<span class="s0">and worn heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her.</span>
<span class="s0">Once, when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia</span>
<span class="s0">was talking of her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found</span>
<span class="s0">the true path of life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force</span>
<span class="s0">that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone</span>
<span class="s0">to sleep Princess Mary thought about this for a long time, and at last</span>
<span class="s0">made up her mind that, strange as it might seem, she must go on a</span>
<span class="s0">pilgrimage. She disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor,</span>
<span class="s0">Father Akinfi, the monk, and he approved of her intention. Under guise</span>
<span class="s0">of a present for the pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim's</span>
<span class="s0">complete costume for herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough</span>
<span class="s0">coat, and a black kerchief. Often, approaching the chest of drawers</span>
<span class="s0">containing this secret treasure, Princess Mary paused, uncertain</span>
<span class="s0">whether the time had not already come to put her project into</span>
<span class="s0">execution.</span>

<span class="s0">Often, listening to the pilgrims' tales, she was so stimulated by</span>
<span class="s0">their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep</span>
<span class="s0">meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning</span>
<span class="s0">everything and running away from home. In imagination she already</span>
<span class="s0">pictured herself by Theodosia's side, dressed in coarse rags,</span>
<span class="s0">walking with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road,</span>
<span class="s0">directing her wanderings from one saint's shrine to another, free from</span>
<span class="s0">envy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where</span>
<span class="s0">there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to</span>
<span class="s0">get used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on</span>
<span class="s0">till my legs fail, and I'll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at</span>
<span class="s0">last reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow</span>
<span class="s0">nor sighing...&quot; thought Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko</span>
<span class="s0">(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that</span>
<span class="s0">she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK SEVEN: 1810 --11</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor--idleness--was a</span>
<span class="s0">condition of the first man's blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man</span>
<span class="s0">has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race</span>
<span class="s0">not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our</span>
<span class="s0">brows, but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both</span>
<span class="s0">idle and at ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we</span>
<span class="s0">are idle. If man could find a state in which he felt that though</span>
<span class="s0">idle he was fulfilling his duty, he would have found one of the</span>
<span class="s0">conditions of man's primitive blessedness. And such a state of</span>
<span class="s0">obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class-</span>
<span class="s0">the military. The chief attraction of military service has consisted</span>
<span class="s0">and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas Rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full</span>
<span class="s0">when, after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pavlograd regiment,</span>
<span class="s0">in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked</span>
<span class="s0">and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was</span>
<span class="s0">well contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters</span>
<span class="s0">from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their</span>
<span class="s0">affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder, and that it</span>
<span class="s0">was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents.</span>

<span class="s0">Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to</span>
<span class="s0">take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the</span>
<span class="s0">entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt</span>
<span class="s0">that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life,</span>
<span class="s0">with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its</span>
<span class="s0">accounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society,</span>
<span class="s0">and with Sonya's love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully</span>
<span class="s0">difficult and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold,</span>
<span class="s0">formal letters in French, beginning: &quot;My dear Mamma,&quot; and ending:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Your obedient son,&quot; which said nothing of when he would return. In</span>
<span class="s0">1810 he received letters from his parents, in which they told him of</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's engagement to Bolkonski, and that the wedding would be in</span>
<span class="s0">a year's time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter</span>
<span class="s0">grieved and mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family,</span>
<span class="s0">should be lost to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of</span>
<span class="s0">view, he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after</span>
<span class="s0">all, and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with permission</span>
<span class="s0">from his dotard father. For a moment he hesitated whether he should</span>
<span class="s0">not apply for leave in order to see Natasha before she was married,</span>
<span class="s0">but then came the maneuvers, and considerations about Sonya and</span>
<span class="s0">about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off.</span>
<span class="s0">But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his</span>
<span class="s0">mother, written without his father's knowledge, and that letter</span>
<span class="s0">persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take</span>
<span class="s0">matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and</span>
<span class="s0">they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and</span>
<span class="s0">trusted Mitenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody</span>
<span class="s0">took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. &quot;For</span>
<span class="s0">God's sake, I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make</span>
<span class="s0">me and the whole family wretched,&quot; wrote the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a</span>
<span class="s0">matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.</span>

<span class="s0">The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any</span>
<span class="s0">rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but</span>
<span class="s0">after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely</span>
<span class="s0">vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and</span>
<span class="s0">when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka</span>
<span class="s0">(Denisov's servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who</span>
<span class="s0">turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was</span>
<span class="s0">going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he</span>
<span class="s0">would go away without having heard from the staff--and this interested</span>
<span class="s0">him extremely--whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive</span>
<span class="s0">the Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to</span>
<span class="s0">think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the</span>
<span class="s0">Polish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had</span>
<span class="s0">betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had</span>
<span class="s0">given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would</span>
<span class="s0">take place without him--he knew he must go away from this good, bright</span>
<span class="s0">world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week</span>
<span class="s0">later he obtained his leave. His hussar comrades--not only those of</span>
<span class="s0">his own regiment, but the whole brigade--gave Rostov a dinner to which</span>
<span class="s0">the subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were</span>
<span class="s0">two bands and two choirs of singers. Rostov danced the Trepak with</span>
<span class="s0">Major Basov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov; the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;hurrah!&quot; and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as</span>
<span class="s0">far as the first post station.</span>

<span class="s0">During the first half of the journey--from Kremenchug to Kiev--all</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov's thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with</span>
<span class="s0">the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to</span>
<span class="s0">forget his three roans and Dozhoyveyko, his quartermaster, and to</span>
<span class="s0">wonder anxiously how things would be at Otradnoe and what he would</span>
<span class="s0">find there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached</span>
<span class="s0">it--far stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law</span>
<span class="s0">by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the</span>
<span class="s0">square of the distance. At the last post station before Otradnoe he</span>
<span class="s0">gave the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran</span>
<span class="s0">breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.</span>

<span class="s0">After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">unsatisfied expectation--the feeling that &quot;everything is just the</span>
<span class="s0">same, so why did I hurry?&quot;--Nicholas began to settle down in his old</span>
<span class="s0">home world. His father and mother were much the same, only a little</span>
<span class="s0">older. What was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional</span>
<span class="s0">discord, which there used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found</span>
<span class="s0">out, was due to the bad state of their affairs. Sonya was nearly</span>
<span class="s0">twenty; she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more</span>
<span class="s0">than she was already, but that was enough. She exhaled happiness and</span>
<span class="s0">love from the time Nicholas returned, and the faithful, unalterable</span>
<span class="s0">love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him. Petya and Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">surprised Nicholas most. Petya was a big handsome boy of thirteen,</span>
<span class="s0">merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking.</span>
<span class="s0">As for Natasha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed</span>
<span class="s0">whenever he looked at her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're not the same at all,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How? Am I uglier?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!&quot; he whispered to</span>
<span class="s0">her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, yes!&quot; cried Natasha, joyfully.</span>

<span class="s0">She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit</span>
<span class="s0">to Otradnoe and showed him his last letter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, are you glad?&quot; Natasha asked. &quot;I am so tranquil and happy</span>
<span class="s0">now.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very glad,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;He is an excellent fellow.... And</span>
<span class="s0">are you very much in love?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How shall I put it?&quot; replied Natasha. &quot;I was in love with Boris,</span>
<span class="s0">with my teacher, and with Denisov, but this is quite different. I feel</span>
<span class="s0">at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists, and</span>
<span class="s0">I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the</span>
<span class="s0">marriage for a year; but Natasha attacked her brother with</span>
<span class="s0">exasperation, proving to him that it could not be otherwise, and</span>
<span class="s0">that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the father's</span>
<span class="s0">will, and that she herself wished it so.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You don't at all understand,&quot; she said.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.</span>

<span class="s0">Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem</span>
<span class="s0">at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband.</span>
<span class="s0">She was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This</span>
<span class="s0">amazed Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkonski's courtship</span>
<span class="s0">skeptically. He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially</span>
<span class="s0">as he had not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him</span>
<span class="s0">that there was something not quite right about this intended marriage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why this delay? Why no betrothal?&quot; he thought. Once, when he had</span>
<span class="s0">touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his</span>
<span class="s0">surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her</span>
<span class="s0">soul she too had doubts about this marriage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see he writes,&quot; said she, showing her son a letter of Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a</span>
<span class="s0">daughter's future married happiness, &quot;he writes that he won't come</span>
<span class="s0">before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His</span>
<span class="s0">health is very delicate. Don't tell Natasha. And don't attach</span>
<span class="s0">importance to her being so bright: that's because she's living through</span>
<span class="s0">the last days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every</span>
<span class="s0">time we receive a letter from him! However, God grant that</span>
<span class="s0">everything turns out well!&quot; (She always ended with these words.) &quot;He</span>
<span class="s0">is an excellent man!&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull.</span>
<span class="s0">He was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid</span>
<span class="s0">business matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw</span>
<span class="s0">off this burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his</span>
<span class="s0">arrival he went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as</span>
<span class="s0">to where he was going, to Mitenka's lodge and demanded an account of</span>
<span class="s0">everything. But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew</span>
<span class="s0">even less than the frightened and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation</span>
<span class="s0">and the examination of the accounts with Mitenka did not last long.</span>
<span class="s0">The village elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were</span>
<span class="s0">waiting in the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young</span>
<span class="s0">count's voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and</span>
<span class="s0">then words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I'll hack the dog to pieces! I'm</span>
<span class="s0">not my father!... Robbing us!...&quot; and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red</span>
<span class="s0">in the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff</span>
<span class="s0">of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great</span>
<span class="s0">agility at convenient moments between the words, shouting, &quot;Be off!</span>
<span class="s0">Never let me see your face here again, you villain!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the</span>
<span class="s0">shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for</span>
<span class="s0">culprits at Otradnoe. Mitenka himself, returning tipsy from the</span>
<span class="s0">town, used to hide there, and many of the residents at Otradnoe,</span>
<span class="s0">hiding from Mitenka, knew of its protective qualities.)</span>

<span class="s0">Mitenka's wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and</span>
<span class="s0">frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar</span>
<span class="s0">was boiling and where the steward's high bedstead stood with its</span>
<span class="s0">patchwork quilt.</span>

<span class="s0">The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by</span>
<span class="s0">with resolute strides and went into the house.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened</span>
<span class="s0">at the lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would</span>
<span class="s0">certainly improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect</span>
<span class="s0">this excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his</span>
<span class="s0">door on tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed</span>
<span class="s0">smile, said to him:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you got excited! Mitenka has</span>
<span class="s0">told me all about it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I knew,&quot; thought Nicholas, &quot;that I should never understand anything</span>
<span class="s0">in this crazy world.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they</span>
<span class="s0">were carried forward--and you did not look at the other page.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have</span>
<span class="s0">done, I have done; but, if you like, I won't speak to him again.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, my dear boy&quot; (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he</span>
<span class="s0">had mismanaged his wife's property and was to blame toward his</span>
<span class="s0">children, but he did not know how to remedy it). &quot;No, I beg you to</span>
<span class="s0">attend to the business. I am old. I...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I</span>
<span class="s0">understand it all less than you do.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings</span>
<span class="s0">forward from page to page,&quot; he thought. &quot;I used to understand what a</span>
<span class="s0">'corner' and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to</span>
<span class="s0">another page I don't understand at all,&quot; said he to himself, and after</span>
<span class="s0">that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess</span>
<span class="s0">called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from</span>
<span class="s0">Anna Mikhaylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he</span>
<span class="s0">thought of doing with it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;You say it rests with me. Well, I</span>
<span class="s0">don't like Anna Mikhaylovna and I don't like Boris, but they were</span>
<span class="s0">our friends and poor. Well then, this!&quot; and he tore up the note, and</span>
<span class="s0">by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After</span>
<span class="s0">that, young Rostov took no further part in any business affairs, but</span>
<span class="s0">devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new</span>
<span class="s0">pursuit--the chase--for which his father kept a large establishment.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts</span>
<span class="s0">congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had</span>
<span class="s0">thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the</span>
<span class="s0">brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle, and</span>
<span class="s0">against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat. The wooded</span>
<span class="s0">ravines and the copses, which at the end of August had still been</span>
<span class="s0">green islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden and</span>
<span class="s0">bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had already</span>
<span class="s0">half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to</span>
<span class="s0">scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best</span>
<span class="s0">time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young</span>
<span class="s0">sportsman Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but</span>
<span class="s0">were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give</span>
<span class="s0">them a three days' rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go</span>
<span class="s0">on a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was</span>
<span class="s0">an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.</span>

<span class="s0">All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the</span>
<span class="s0">air was sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began</span>
<span class="s0">to thaw. On the fifteenth, when young Rostov, in his dressing gown,</span>
<span class="s0">looked out of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for</span>
<span class="s0">hunting: it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth</span>
<span class="s0">without any wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping,</span>
<span class="s0">microscopic particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the</span>
<span class="s0">garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly</span>
<span class="s0">fallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black</span>
<span class="s0">and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into</span>
<span class="s0">the dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy</span>
<span class="s0">porch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a</span>
<span class="s0">black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got</span>
<span class="s0">up on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a</span>
<span class="s0">hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and</span>
<span class="s0">mustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the</span>
<span class="s0">garden path, arched his back and, rushing headlong toward the porch</span>
<span class="s0">with lifted tail, began rubbing himself against his legs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O-hoy!&quot; came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman's call</span>
<span class="s0">which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round</span>
<span class="s0">the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,</span>
<span class="s0">wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian</span>
<span class="s0">fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence</span>
<span class="s0">and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his</span>
<span class="s0">Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This</span>
<span class="s0">scorn was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,</span>
<span class="s0">disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all</span>
<span class="s0">the same his serf and huntsman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Daniel!&quot; Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the</span>
<span class="s0">weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away</span>
<span class="s0">by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all</span>
<span class="s0">his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his</span>
<span class="s0">mistress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What orders, your excellency?&quot; said the huntsman in his deep</span>
<span class="s0">bass, deep as a proto-deacon's and hoarse with hallooing--and two</span>
<span class="s0">flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who</span>
<span class="s0">was silent. &quot;Can you resist it?&quot; those eyes seemed to be asking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, scratching Milka behind the ears.</span>

<span class="s0">Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen,&quot; his bass boomed out after a</span>
<span class="s0">minute's pause. &quot;He says she's moved them into the Otradnoe enclosure.</span>
<span class="s0">They were howling there.&quot; (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom</span>
<span class="s0">they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otradnoe copse, a small</span>
<span class="s0">place a mile and a half from the house.)</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We ought to go, don't you think so?&quot; said Nicholas. &quot;Come to me</span>
<span class="s0">with Uvarka.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;As you please.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then put off feeding them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Five minutes later Daniel and Uvarka were standing in Nicholas'</span>
<span class="s0">big study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was</span>
<span class="s0">like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and</span>
<span class="s0">surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual</span>
<span class="s0">stood just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for</span>
<span class="s0">fear of breaking something in the master's apartment, and he</span>
<span class="s0">hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that</span>
<span class="s0">ceiling, out into the open under the sky once more.</span>

<span class="s0">Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion</span>
<span class="s0">that the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting),</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was</span>
<span class="s0">about to go Natasha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her</span>
<span class="s0">hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse's big shawl wrapped</span>
<span class="s0">round her. Petya ran in at the same time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are going?&quot; asked Natasha. &quot;I knew you would! Sonya said you</span>
<span class="s0">wouldn't go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you</span>
<span class="s0">couldn't help going.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, we are going,&quot; replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as</span>
<span class="s0">he intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">Petya. &quot;We are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for</span>
<span class="s0">you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know it is my greatest pleasure,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;It's not fair;</span>
<span class="s0">you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said</span>
<span class="s0">nothing to us about it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;'No barrier bars a Russian's path'--we'll go!&quot; shouted Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you can't. Mamma said you mustn't,&quot; said Nicholas to Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I'll go. I shall certainly go,&quot; said Natasha decisively.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Daniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my</span>
<span class="s0">dogs,&quot; she added to the huntsman.</span>

<span class="s0">It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but</span>
<span class="s0">to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible.</span>
<span class="s0">He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his</span>
<span class="s0">business, careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on</span>
<span class="s0">the young lady.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting</span>
<span class="s0">establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son's</span>
<span class="s0">care, being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September,</span>
<span class="s0">prepared to go out with the others.</span>

<span class="s0">In an hour's time the whole hunting party was at the porch.</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no</span>
<span class="s0">time for attending to trifles, went past Natasha and Petya who were</span>
<span class="s0">trying to tell him something. He had a look at all the details of</span>
<span class="s0">the hunt, sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the</span>
<span class="s0">quarry, mounted his chestnut Donets, and whistling to his own leash of</span>
<span class="s0">borzois, set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the</span>
<span class="s0">Otradnoe wood. The old count's horse, a sorrel gelding called</span>
<span class="s0">Viflyanka, was led by the groom in attendance on him, while the</span>
<span class="s0">count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved</span>
<span class="s0">for him.</span>

<span class="s0">They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and</span>
<span class="s0">whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen and</span>
<span class="s0">more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash</span>
<span class="s0">belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and</span>
<span class="s0">thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.</span>

<span class="s0">Each dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his</span>
<span class="s0">business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the</span>
<span class="s0">fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,</span>
<span class="s0">along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert.</span>

<span class="s0">The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and</span>
<span class="s0">then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky</span>
<span class="s0">still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the</span>
<span class="s0">air was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a</span>
<span class="s0">huntsman, the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a</span>
<span class="s0">straggling hound could be heard.</span>

<span class="s0">When they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders</span>
<span class="s0">with dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostovs. In</span>
<span class="s0">front rode a fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray</span>
<span class="s0">mustache.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good morning, Uncle!&quot; said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's it. Come on!... I was sure of it,&quot; began &quot;Uncle.&quot; (He was</span>
<span class="s0">a distant relative of the Rostovs', a man of small means, and their</span>
<span class="s0">neighbor.) &quot;I knew you wouldn't be able to resist it and it's a good</span>
<span class="s0">thing you're going. That's it! Come on! (This was &quot;Uncle's&quot; favorite</span>
<span class="s0">expression.) &quot;Take the covert at once, for my Girchik says the Ilagins</span>
<span class="s0">are at Korniki with their hounds. That's it. Come on!... They'll</span>
<span class="s0">take the cubs from under your very nose.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's where I'm going. Shall we join up our packs?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">The hounds were joined into one pack, and &quot;Uncle&quot; and Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">rode on side by side. Natasha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide</span>
<span class="s0">her eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed</span>
<span class="s0">by Petya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and</span>
<span class="s0">by a groom appointed to look after her. Petya, who was laughing,</span>
<span class="s0">whipped and pulled at his horse. Natasha sat easily and confidently on</span>
<span class="s0">her black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha. He did not</span>
<span class="s0">like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!&quot; shouted Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good morning, good morning! But don't go overriding the hounds,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said &quot;Uncle&quot; sternly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunila is! He knew me,&quot; said Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">referring to her favorite hound.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In the first place, Trunila is not a 'dog,' but a harrier,&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel</span>
<span class="s0">the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">understood it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way, Uncle,&quot; she said.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;We'll go to our places and won't budge.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A good thing too, little countess,&quot; said &quot;Uncle,&quot; &quot;only mind you</span>
<span class="s0">don't fall off your horse,&quot; he added, &quot;because--that's it, come on!-</span>
<span class="s0">you've nothing to hold on to.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards</span>
<span class="s0">off, the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rostov, having finally</span>
<span class="s0">settled with &quot;Uncle&quot; where they should set on the hounds, and having</span>
<span class="s0">shown Natasha where she was to stand--a spot where nothing could</span>
<span class="s0">possibly run out--went round above the ravine.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, nephew, you're going for a big wolf,&quot; said &quot;Uncle.&quot; &quot;Mind and</span>
<span class="s0">don't let her slip!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's as may happen,&quot; answered Rostov. &quot;Karay, here!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">shouted, answering &quot;Uncle's&quot; remark by this call to his borzoi.</span>
<span class="s0">Karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having</span>
<span class="s0">tackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.</span>

<span class="s0">The old count, knowing his son's ardor in the hunt, hurried so as</span>
<span class="s0">not to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when</span>
<span class="s0">Count Ilya Rostov, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove</span>
<span class="s0">up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for</span>
<span class="s0">him, where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and</span>
<span class="s0">fastened on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek,</span>
<span class="s0">well-fed, and comfortable horse, Viflyanka, which was turning gray,</span>
<span class="s0">like himself. His horses and trap were sent home. Count Ilya Rostov,</span>
<span class="s0">though not at heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well,</span>
<span class="s0">and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged</span>
<span class="s0">his reins, settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was</span>
<span class="s0">ready, looked about with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">Beside him was Simon Chekmar, his personal attendant, an old</span>
<span class="s0">horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekmar held in leash three</span>
<span class="s0">formidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master</span>
<span class="s0">and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred</span>
<span class="s0">paces farther along the edge of the wood stood Mitka, the count's</span>
<span class="s0">other groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the</span>
<span class="s0">hunt, by old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled</span>
<span class="s0">brandy, taken a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his</span>
<span class="s0">favorite Bordeaux.</span>

<span class="s0">He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were</span>
<span class="s0">rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his</span>
<span class="s0">saddle, wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out</span>
<span class="s0">for an outing.</span>

<span class="s0">The thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmar, having got everything ready,</span>
<span class="s0">kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of</span>
<span class="s0">terms for thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in</span>
<span class="s0">expected a pleasant chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through</span>
<span class="s0">the wood (it was plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind</span>
<span class="s0">the count. This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman's</span>
<span class="s0">cloak, with a tall peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who</span>
<span class="s0">went by a woman's name, Nastasya Ivanovna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Nastasya Ivanovna!&quot; whispered the count, winking at him.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;If you scare away the beast, Daniel'll give it you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know a thing or two myself!&quot; said Nastasya Ivanovna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hush!&quot; whispered the count and turned to Simon. &quot;Have you seen</span>
<span class="s0">the young countess?&quot; he asked. &quot;Where is she?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;With young Count Peter, by the Zharov rank grass,&quot; answered</span>
<span class="s0">Simon, smiling. &quot;Though she's a lady, she's very fond of hunting.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And you're surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">count. &quot;She's as good as many a man!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course! It's marvelous. So bold, so easy!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyadov upland, isn't he?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so</span>
<span class="s0">well that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,&quot; said Simon, well</span>
<span class="s0">knowing what would please his master.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the</span>
<span class="s0">Zavarzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight</span>
<span class="s0">when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand</span>
<span class="s0">rubles and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search</span>
<span class="s0">far to find another as smart.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To search far...&quot; repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not</span>
<span class="s0">said more. &quot;To search far,&quot; he said, turning back the skirt of his</span>
<span class="s0">coat to get at his snuffbox.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael</span>
<span class="s0">Sidorych...&quot; Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had</span>
<span class="s0">distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three</span>
<span class="s0">hounds giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a</span>
<span class="s0">warning finger at his master. &quot;They are on the scent of the cubs...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he whispered, &quot;straight to the Lyadov uplands.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked</span>
<span class="s0">into the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space,</span>
<span class="s0">holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry</span>
<span class="s0">of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel's</span>
<span class="s0">hunting horn; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be</span>
<span class="s0">heard in full cry, with that peculiar lift in the note that</span>
<span class="s0">indicates that they are after a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on</span>
<span class="s0">the hounds, but changed to the cry of ulyulyu, and above the others</span>
<span class="s0">rose Daniel's voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open</span>
<span class="s0">field.</span>

<span class="s0">After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his</span>
<span class="s0">attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into</span>
<span class="s0">two packs: the sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue,</span>
<span class="s0">began to die away in the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood</span>
<span class="s0">past the count, and it was with this that Daniel's voice was heard</span>
<span class="s0">calling ulyulyu. The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart</span>
<span class="s0">again, but both were becoming more distant.</span>

<span class="s0">Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi</span>
<span class="s0">had entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in</span>
<span class="s0">his hand, opened it and took a pinch. &quot;Back!&quot; cried Simon to a</span>
<span class="s0">borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and</span>
<span class="s0">dropped the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted to pick it up.</span>
<span class="s0">The count and Simon were looking at him.</span>

<span class="s0">Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were</span>
<span class="s0">just in front of them.</span>

<span class="s0">The count turned and saw on his right Mitka staring at him with eyes</span>
<span class="s0">starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to</span>
<span class="s0">the other side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look out!&quot; he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had</span>
<span class="s0">long fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he</span>
<span class="s0">galloped toward the count.</span>

<span class="s0">The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a</span>
<span class="s0">wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet</span>
<span class="s0">lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.</span>
<span class="s0">The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the</span>
<span class="s0">horses' feet at the wolf.</span>

<span class="s0">The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs</span>
<span class="s0">awkwardly, like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly</span>
<span class="s0">swaying from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish</span>
<span class="s0">of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same</span>
<span class="s0">instant, with a cry like a wail, first one hound, then another, and</span>
<span class="s0">then another, sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the</span>
<span class="s0">whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf</span>
<span class="s0">had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and</span>
<span class="s0">Daniel's chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long back</span>
<span class="s0">sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his disheveled gray hair hanging</span>
<span class="s0">over his flushed, perspiring face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...&quot; he cried. When he caught sight of the</span>
<span class="s0">count his eyes flashed lightning.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Blast you!&quot; he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the</span>
<span class="s0">count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You've let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!&quot; and as if scorning to</span>
<span class="s0">say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving</span>
<span class="s0">flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count</span>
<span class="s0">had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a</span>
<span class="s0">punished schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon's</span>
<span class="s0">sympathy for his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was</span>
<span class="s0">galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both</span>
<span class="s0">sides, all trying to head the wolf, but it vanished into the wood</span>
<span class="s0">before they could do so.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the</span>
<span class="s0">wolf. By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of</span>
<span class="s0">the dogs whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of</span>
<span class="s0">the huntsmen approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was</span>
<span class="s0">happening at the copse. He knew that young and old wolves were</span>
<span class="s0">there, that the hounds had separated into two packs, that somewhere</span>
<span class="s0">a wolf was being chased, and that something had gone wrong. He</span>
<span class="s0">expected the wolf to come his way any moment. He made thousands of</span>
<span class="s0">different conjectures as to where and from what side the beast would</span>
<span class="s0">come and how he would set upon it. Hope alternated with despair.</span>
<span class="s0">Several times he addressed a prayer to God that the wolf should come</span>
<span class="s0">his way. He prayed with that passionate and shame-faced feeling with</span>
<span class="s0">which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial</span>
<span class="s0">causes. &quot;What would it be to Thee to do this for me?&quot; he said to</span>
<span class="s0">God. &quot;I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee,</span>
<span class="s0">but for God's sake do let the old wolf come my way and let Karay</span>
<span class="s0">spring at it--in sight of 'Uncle' who is watching from over there--and</span>
<span class="s0">seize it by the throat in a death grip!&quot; A thousand times during</span>
<span class="s0">that half-hour Rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of</span>
<span class="s0">the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth</span>
<span class="s0">and the gully with its water-worn side and &quot;Uncle's&quot; cap just</span>
<span class="s0">visible above the bush on his right.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I shan't have such luck,&quot; thought Rostov, &quot;yet what wouldn't it</span>
<span class="s0">be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am</span>
<span class="s0">always unlucky.&quot; Memories of Austerlitz and of Dolokhov flashed</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly and clearly through his mind. &quot;Only once in my life to get</span>
<span class="s0">an old wolf, I want only that!&quot; thought he, straining eyes and ears</span>
<span class="s0">and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the</span>
<span class="s0">slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.</span>

<span class="s0">Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him</span>
<span class="s0">across the deserted field. &quot;No, it can't be!&quot; thought Rostov, taking a</span>
<span class="s0">deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped</span>
<span class="s0">for. The height of happiness was reached--and so simply, without</span>
<span class="s0">warning, or noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and</span>
<span class="s0">jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path. She was an old</span>
<span class="s0">animal with a gray back and big reddish belly. She ran without</span>
<span class="s0">hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw her. Rostov, holding his</span>
<span class="s0">breath, looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay not seeing</span>
<span class="s0">the wolf or understanding the situation. Old Karay had turned his head</span>
<span class="s0">and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and</span>
<span class="s0">snapping at his hind legs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ulyulyulyu!&quot; whispered Rostov, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped</span>
<span class="s0">up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Karay</span>
<span class="s0">finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up</span>
<span class="s0">with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Shall I loose them or not?&quot; Nicholas asked himself as the wolf</span>
<span class="s0">approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf's whole</span>
<span class="s0">physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never</span>
<span class="s0">seen before--human eyes fixed upon her--and turning her head a</span>
<span class="s0">little toward Rostov, she paused.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...&quot; the wolf seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">say to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round</span>
<span class="s0">and with a quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ulyulyu!&quot; cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own</span>
<span class="s0">accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies</span>
<span class="s0">to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping,</span>
<span class="s0">nor see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only</span>
<span class="s0">the wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same</span>
<span class="s0">direction along the hollow. The first to come into view was Milka,</span>
<span class="s0">with her black markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the</span>
<span class="s0">wolf. Nearer and nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf</span>
<span class="s0">turned its head to face her, and instead of putting on speed as she</span>
<span class="s0">usually did Milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ulyulyulyulyu!&quot; shouted Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka, sprang</span>
<span class="s0">impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but</span>
<span class="s0">immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her</span>
<span class="s0">teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of</span>
<span class="s0">a couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to</span>
<span class="s0">her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She'll get away! No, it's impossible!&quot; thought Nicholas, still</span>
<span class="s0">shouting with a hoarse voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Karay, ulyulyu!...&quot; he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi</span>
<span class="s0">who was now his only hope. Karay, with all the strength age had left</span>
<span class="s0">him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf,</span>
<span class="s0">galloped heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the</span>
<span class="s0">wolf's lope and the borzoi's slower pace made it plain that Karay</span>
<span class="s0">had miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of</span>
<span class="s0">him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach</span>
<span class="s0">it. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping</span>
<span class="s0">almost straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish</span>

<span class="s0">young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed</span>
<span class="s0">impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But</span>
<span class="s0">the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,</span>
<span class="s0">gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a</span>
<span class="s0">piercing yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a</span>
<span class="s0">gash in its side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Karay? Old fellow!...&quot; wailed Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf's path,</span>
<span class="s0">the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within</span>
<span class="s0">five paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes on Karay, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and</span>
<span class="s0">increased her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something</span>
<span class="s0">happened to Karay--the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they</span>
<span class="s0">rolled together down into a gully just in front of them.</span>

<span class="s0">That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully</span>
<span class="s0">with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and</span>
<span class="s0">outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears</span>
<span class="s0">laid back (Karay was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest</span>
<span class="s0">moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to</span>
<span class="s0">dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up</span>
<span class="s0">from among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge</span>
<span class="s0">of the gully. She clicked her teeth (Karay no longer had her by the</span>
<span class="s0">throat), leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and</span>
<span class="s0">having disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again,</span>
<span class="s0">went forward. Karay, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or</span>
<span class="s0">wounded, climbed with difficulty out of the gully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh my God! Why?&quot; Nicholas cried in despair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle's&quot; huntsman was galloping from the other side across the</span>
<span class="s0">wolf's path and his borzois once more stopped the animal's advance.</span>
<span class="s0">She was again hemmed in.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas and his attendant, with &quot;Uncle&quot; and his huntsman, were</span>
<span class="s0">all riding round the wolf, crying &quot;ulyulyu!&quot; shouting and preparing to</span>
<span class="s0">dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward</span>
<span class="s0">again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she</span>
<span class="s0">would be safe.</span>

<span class="s0">Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the</span>
<span class="s0">ulyulyuing, had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karay seize the wolf,</span>
<span class="s0">and checked his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he</span>
<span class="s0">saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself</span>
<span class="s0">and ran for safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf</span>
<span class="s0">but straight toward the wood, just as Karay had run to cut the</span>
<span class="s0">animal off. As a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just</span>
<span class="s0">when she had been stopped a second time by &quot;Uncle's&quot; borzois.</span>

<span class="s0">Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand</span>
<span class="s0">and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip</span>
<span class="s0">as if it were a flail.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut,</span>
<span class="s0">breathing heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body</span>
<span class="s0">and saw Daniel lying on the wolf's back among the dogs, trying to</span>
<span class="s0">seize her by the ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to</span>
<span class="s0">the wolf herself that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed</span>
<span class="s0">back her ears and tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her.</span>
<span class="s0">Daniel rose a little, took a step, and with his whole weight, as if</span>
<span class="s0">lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by the ears.</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, &quot;Don't! We'll</span>
<span class="s0">gag her!&quot; and, changing his position, set his foot on the wolf's neck.</span>
<span class="s0">A stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash,</span>
<span class="s0">as if bridled, her legs were bound together, and Daniel rolled her</span>
<span class="s0">over once or twice from side to side.</span>

<span class="s0">With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a</span>
<span class="s0">shying and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her,</span>
<span class="s0">took her to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had</span>
<span class="s0">killed two of the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled</span>
<span class="s0">with their booty and their stories, and all came to look at the</span>
<span class="s0">wolf, which, with her broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten</span>
<span class="s0">stick between her jaws, gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd</span>
<span class="s0">of dogs and men surrounding her. When she was touched, she jerked</span>
<span class="s0">her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody. Old Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov also rode up and touched the wolf.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, what a formidable one!&quot; said he. &quot;A formidable one, eh?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">asked Daniel, who was standing near.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.</span>

<span class="s0">The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with</span>
<span class="s0">Daniel.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!&quot; said the count.</span>

<span class="s0">For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable</span>
<span class="s0">smile.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">The old count went home, and Natasha and Petya promised to return</span>
<span class="s0">very soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At</span>
<span class="s0">midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with</span>
<span class="s0">young trees. Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his</span>
<span class="s0">whips.</span>

<span class="s0">Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood</span>
<span class="s0">alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been</span>
<span class="s0">loosed before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltorn, giving tongue at</span>
<span class="s0">intervals; other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving</span>
<span class="s0">tongue. A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a</span>
<span class="s0">fox had been found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along</span>
<span class="s0">the ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the</span>
<span class="s0">ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself</span>
<span class="s0">at any moment on the ryefield opposite.</span>

<span class="s0">The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois,</span>
<span class="s0">and Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going</span>
<span class="s0">hard across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew</span>
<span class="s0">close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and</span>
<span class="s0">sharper curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white</span>
<span class="s0">borzoi dashed in followed by a black one, and everything was in</span>
<span class="s0">confusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying</span>
<span class="s0">their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the</span>
<span class="s0">group. Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in a red cap, the</span>
<span class="s0">other, a stranger, in a green coat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's this?&quot; thought Nicholas. &quot;Where's that huntsman from? He</span>
<span class="s0">is not 'Uncle's' man.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without</span>
<span class="s0">strapping it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high</span>
<span class="s0">saddles, stood near them and there too the dogs were lying. The</span>
<span class="s0">huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox. Then from that</span>
<span class="s0">spot came the sound of a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of</span>
<span class="s0">a fight.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's Ilagin's huntsman having a row with our Ivan,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas' groom.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to him, and rode</span>
<span class="s0">at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds</span>
<span class="s0">together. Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight</span>
<span class="s0">was going on.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and Petya, who had ridden</span>
<span class="s0">up, stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would</span>
<span class="s0">end. Out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and</span>
<span class="s0">rode toward his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper.</span>
<span class="s0">While still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak</span>
<span class="s0">respectfully, but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry.</span>
<span class="s0">One of his eyes was black, but he probably was not even aware of it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What has happened?&quot; asked Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my</span>
<span class="s0">gray bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the</span>
<span class="s0">fox! I gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want</span>
<span class="s0">a taste of this?...&quot; said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and</span>
<span class="s0">probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and</span>
<span class="s0">Petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy's,</span>
<span class="s0">Ilagin's, hunting party was.</span>

<span class="s0">The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.</span>

<span class="s0">The facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel</span>
<span class="s0">and were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very</span>
<span class="s0">woods the Rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs</span>
<span class="s0">had chased.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas, though he had never seen Ilagin, with his usual absence of</span>
<span class="s0">moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his</span>
<span class="s0">arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe.</span>
<span class="s0">He rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and</span>
<span class="s0">fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish</span>
<span class="s0">his enemy.</span>

<span class="s0">Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman</span>
<span class="s0">in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black</span>
<span class="s0">horse, accompanied by two hunt servants.</span>

<span class="s0">Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and</span>
<span class="s0">courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young</span>
<span class="s0">count's acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilagin raised</span>
<span class="s0">his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and</span>
<span class="s0">would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox</span>
<span class="s0">hunted by someone else's borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted</span>
<span class="s0">with the count and invited him to draw his covert.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had</span>
<span class="s0">followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging</span>
<span class="s0">friendly greetings, she rode up to them. Ilagin lifted his beaver</span>
<span class="s0">cap still higher to Natasha and said, with a pleasant smile, that</span>
<span class="s0">the young countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as</span>
<span class="s0">well as in her beauty, of which he had heard much.</span>

<span class="s0">To expiate his huntsman's offense, Ilagin pressed the Rostovs to</span>
<span class="s0">come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for</span>
<span class="s0">himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and</span>
<span class="s0">the hunt, now doubled, moved on.</span>

<span class="s0">The way to Iligin's upland was across the fields. The hunt</span>
<span class="s0">servants fell into line. The masters rode together. &quot;Uncle,&quot; Rostov,</span>
<span class="s0">and Ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one another's dogs, trying</span>
<span class="s0">not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for</span>
<span class="s0">rivals to their own borzois.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small,</span>
<span class="s0">pure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Ilagin's leash, slender but with</span>
<span class="s0">muscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He</span>
<span class="s0">had heard of the swiftness of Ilagin's borzois, and in that</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own Milka.</span>

<span class="s0">In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilagin about the</span>
<span class="s0">year's harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A fine little bitch, that!&quot; said he in a careless tone. &quot;Is she</span>
<span class="s0">swift?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That one? Yes, she's a good dog, gets what she's after,&quot; answered</span>
<span class="s0">Ilagin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erza, for which, a year</span>
<span class="s0">before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. &quot;So</span>
<span class="s0">in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And considering</span>
<span class="s0">it polite to return the young count's compliment, Ilagin looked at his</span>
<span class="s0">borzois and picked out Milka who attracted his attention by her</span>
<span class="s0">breadth. &quot;That black-spotted one of yours is fine--well shaped!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, she's fast enough,&quot; replied Nicholas, and thought: &quot;If only</span>
<span class="s0">a full-grown hare would cross the field now I'd show you what sort</span>
<span class="s0">of borzoi she is,&quot; and turning to his groom, he said he would give a</span>
<span class="s0">ruble to anyone who found a hare.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't understand,&quot; continued Ilagin, &quot;how some sportsmen can be</span>
<span class="s0">so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count, I</span>
<span class="s0">enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?&quot; (he</span>
<span class="s0">again raised his cap to Natasha) &quot;but as for counting skins and what</span>
<span class="s0">one takes, I don't care about that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course not!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not mine catches</span>
<span class="s0">something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not</span>
<span class="s0">so, Count? For I consider that...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A-tu!&quot; came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,</span>
<span class="s0">who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip</span>
<span class="s0">aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, &quot;A-tu!&quot; (This call and</span>
<span class="s0">the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, he has found one, I think,&quot; said Ilagin carelessly. &quot;Yes, we</span>
<span class="s0">must ride up.... Shall we both course it?&quot; answered Nicholas, seeing</span>
<span class="s0">in Erza and &quot;Uncle's&quot; red Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a</span>
<span class="s0">chance of pitting against his own borzois. &quot;And suppose they outdo</span>
<span class="s0">my Milka at once!&quot; he thought as he rode with &quot;Uncle&quot; and Ilagin</span>
<span class="s0">toward the hare.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A full-grown one?&quot; asked Ilagin as he approached the whip who had</span>
<span class="s0">sighted the hare--and not without agitation he looked round and</span>
<span class="s0">whistled to Erza.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And you, Michael Nikanorovich?&quot; he said, addressing &quot;Uncle.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can I join in? Why, you've given a village for each of your</span>
<span class="s0">borzois! That's it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours</span>
<span class="s0">against one another, you two, and I'll look on!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Rugay, hey, hey!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Rugayushka!&quot; he added, involuntarily</span>
<span class="s0">by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on</span>
<span class="s0">this red borzoi. Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly</span>
<span class="s0">men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by</span>
<span class="s0">it.</span>

<span class="s0">The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and</span>
<span class="s0">the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were</span>
<span class="s0">far off on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but</span>
<span class="s0">not the gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and</span>
<span class="s0">sedately.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How is it pointing?&quot; asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces</span>
<span class="s0">toward the whip who had sighted the hare.</span>

<span class="s0">But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming</span>
<span class="s0">next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash</span>
<span class="s0">rushed downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the</span>
<span class="s0">borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare.</span>
<span class="s0">All the hunt, who had been moving slowly, shouted, &quot;Stop!&quot; calling</span>
<span class="s0">in the hounds, while the borzoi whips, with a cry of &quot;A-tu!&quot; galloped</span>
<span class="s0">across the field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilagin,</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, Natasha, and &quot;Uncle&quot; flew, reckless of where and how they</span>
<span class="s0">went, seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose</span>
<span class="s0">sight even for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started</span>
<span class="s0">was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at</span>
<span class="s0">once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling</span>
<span class="s0">that resounded from all sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not</span>
<span class="s0">very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him, and, finally having</span>
<span class="s0">chosen his direction and realized his danger, laid back his ears and</span>
<span class="s0">rushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble, but in front of</span>
<span class="s0">him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft. The two borzois</span>
<span class="s0">of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the nearest, were the</span>
<span class="s0">first to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far before Ilagin's</span>
<span class="s0">red-spotted Erza passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare</span>
<span class="s0">with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had</span>
<span class="s0">seized him, rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his back and</span>
<span class="s0">bounded off yet more swiftly. From behind Erza rushed the</span>
<span class="s0">broad-haunched, black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the</span>
<span class="s0">hare.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Milashka, dear!&quot; rose Nicholas' triumphant cry. It looked as if</span>
<span class="s0">Milka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and</span>
<span class="s0">flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erza reached</span>
<span class="s0">him, but when close to the hare's scut paused as if measuring the</span>
<span class="s0">distance, so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind</span>
<span class="s0">leg.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Erza, darling!&quot; Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erza did</span>
<span class="s0">not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have</span>
<span class="s0">seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between</span>
<span class="s0">the winter rye and the stubble. Again Erza and Milka were abreast,</span>
<span class="s0">running like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the</span>
<span class="s0">hare, but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the</span>
<span class="s0">borzois did not overtake him so quickly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Rugay, Rugayushka! That's it, come on!&quot; came a third voice just</span>
<span class="s0">then, and &quot;Uncle's&quot; red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught</span>
<span class="s0">up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of</span>
<span class="s0">the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off</span>
<span class="s0">the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,</span>
<span class="s0">sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was</span>
<span class="s0">how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of</span>
<span class="s0">borzois surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd of dogs. Only the delighted &quot;Uncle&quot; dismounted, and cut off a</span>
<span class="s0">pad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously</span>
<span class="s0">glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He</span>
<span class="s0">spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about. &quot;That's it,</span>
<span class="s0">come on! That's a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the</span>
<span class="s0">thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That's it, come</span>
<span class="s0">on!&quot; said he, panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were</span>
<span class="s0">abusing someone, as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him,</span>
<span class="s0">and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself. &quot;There</span>
<span class="s0">are your thousand-ruble ones.... That's it, come on!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Rugay, here's a pad for you!&quot; he said, throwing down the hare's</span>
<span class="s0">muddy pad. &quot;You've deserved it, that's it, come on!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She'd tired herself out, she'd run it down three times by herself,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of</span>
<span class="s0">whether he were heard or not.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what is there in running across it like that?&quot; said Ilagin's</span>
<span class="s0">groom.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take</span>
<span class="s0">it,&quot; Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop</span>
<span class="s0">and his excitement. At the same moment Natasha, without drawing</span>
<span class="s0">breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set</span>
<span class="s0">everyone's ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the</span>
<span class="s0">others expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that</span>
<span class="s0">she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone</span>
<span class="s0">else would have been amazed at it at any other time. &quot;Uncle&quot; himself</span>
<span class="s0">twisted up the hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horse's</span>
<span class="s0">back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with</span>
<span class="s0">an air of not wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode</span>
<span class="s0">off. The others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much</span>
<span class="s0">later were they able to regain their former affectation of</span>
<span class="s0">indifference. For a long time they continued to look at red Rugay who,</span>
<span class="s0">his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash,</span>
<span class="s0">walked along just behind &quot;Uncle's&quot; horse with the serene air of a</span>
<span class="s0">conqueror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I am like any other dog as long as it's not a question of</span>
<span class="s0">coursing. But when it is, then look out!&quot; his appearance seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas to be saying.</span>

<span class="s0">When, much later, &quot;Uncle&quot; rode up to Nicholas and began talking to</span>
<span class="s0">him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, &quot;Uncle&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">deigned to speak to him.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">Toward evening Ilagin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they</span>
<span class="s0">were so far from home that he accepted &quot;Uncle's&quot; offer that the</span>
<span class="s0">hunting party should spend the night in his little village of</span>
<span class="s0">Mikhaylovna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And if you put up at my house that will be better still. That's it,</span>
<span class="s0">come on!&quot; said &quot;Uncle.&quot; &quot;You see it's damp weather, and you could</span>
<span class="s0">rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle's&quot; offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for</span>
<span class="s0">a trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to &quot;Uncle's&quot; house.</span>

<span class="s0">Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the</span>
<span class="s0">front porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and</span>
<span class="s0">young, as well as children, popped out from the back entrance to</span>
<span class="s0">have a look at the hunters who were arriving. The presence of Natasha-</span>
<span class="s0">a woman, a lady, and on horseback--raised the curiosity of the serfs</span>
<span class="s0">to such a degree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the</span>
<span class="s0">face, and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though</span>
<span class="s0">she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or</span>
<span class="s0">understand what was said about her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Arinka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt</span>
<span class="s0">dangles.... See, she's got a little hunting horn!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Goodness gracious! See her knife?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Isn't she a Tartar!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How is it you didn't go head over heels?&quot; asked the boldest of all,</span>
<span class="s0">addressing Natasha directly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which</span>
<span class="s0">stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his</span>
<span class="s0">retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should</span>
<span class="s0">take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made</span>
<span class="s0">to receive the guests and the visitors.</span>

<span class="s0">The serfs all dispersed. &quot;Uncle&quot; lifted Natasha off her horse and</span>
<span class="s0">taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch.</span>
<span class="s0">The house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean--it</span>
<span class="s0">did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless--but</span>
<span class="s0">neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of</span>
<span class="s0">fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with</span>
<span class="s0">a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a</span>
<span class="s0">round birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room</span>
<span class="s0">where there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of</span>
<span class="s0">Suvorov, of the host's father and mother, and of himself in military</span>
<span class="s0">uniform. The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. &quot;Uncle&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went</span>
<span class="s0">out of the room. Rugay, his back still muddy, came into the room and</span>
<span class="s0">lay down on the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth.</span>
<span class="s0">Leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with</span>
<span class="s0">ragged curtains could be seen. From behind this came women's</span>
<span class="s0">laughter and whispers. Natasha, Nicholas, and Petya took off their</span>
<span class="s0">wraps and sat down on the sofa. Petya, leaning on his elbow, fell</span>
<span class="s0">asleep at once. Natasha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces</span>
<span class="s0">glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another</span>
<span class="s0">(now that the hunt was over and they were in the house, Nicholas no</span>
<span class="s0">longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over</span>
<span class="s0">his sister), Natasha gave him a wink, and neither refrained long</span>
<span class="s0">from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a</span>
<span class="s0">pretext ready to account for it.</span>

<span class="s0">After a while &quot;Uncle&quot; came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and</span>
<span class="s0">small top boots. And Natasha felt that this costume, the very one</span>
<span class="s0">she had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe, was just the</span>
<span class="s0">right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the</span>
<span class="s0">brother's and sister's laughter (it could never enter his head that</span>
<span class="s0">they might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the</span>
<span class="s0">merriment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's right, young countess, that's it, come on! I never saw</span>
<span class="s0">anyone like her!&quot; said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem</span>
<span class="s0">and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another</span>
<span class="s0">that had been cut short. &quot;She's ridden all day like a man, and is as</span>
<span class="s0">fresh as ever!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after &quot;Uncle's&quot; reappearance the door was opened, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking</span>
<span class="s0">woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered</span>
<span class="s0">carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality</span>
<span class="s0">in her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and,</span>
<span class="s0">with a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional</span>
<span class="s0">stoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and</span>
<span class="s0">throw back her head, this woman (who was &quot;Uncle's&quot; housekeeper) trod</span>
<span class="s0">very lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her</span>
<span class="s0">plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors</span>
<span class="s0">d'oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had</span>
<span class="s0">finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on</span>
<span class="s0">her face. &quot;Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand 'Uncle'?&quot; her</span>
<span class="s0">expression said to Rostov. How could one help understanding? Not</span>
<span class="s0">only Nicholas, but even Natasha understood the meaning of his puckered</span>
<span class="s0">brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips</span>
<span class="s0">when Anisya Fedorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb</span>
<span class="s0">wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with</span>
<span class="s0">buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead,</span>
<span class="s0">apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards</span>
<span class="s0">she brought a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey,</span>
<span class="s0">and preserves made with sugar.</span>

<span class="s0">All this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna's housekeeping,</span>
<span class="s0">gathered and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a</span>
<span class="s0">smack of Anisya Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness,</span>
<span class="s0">cleanliness, whiteness, and pleasant smiles.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Take this, little Lady-Countess!&quot; she kept saying, as she offered</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha first one thing and then another.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten</span>
<span class="s0">such buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets,</span>
<span class="s0">or such a chicken anywhere. Anisya Fedorovna left the room.</span>

<span class="s0">After supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostov and &quot;Uncle&quot; talked of</span>
<span class="s0">past and future hunts, of Rugay and Ilagin's dogs, while Natasha sat</span>
<span class="s0">upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried</span>
<span class="s0">several times to wake Petya that he might eat something, but he only</span>
<span class="s0">muttered incoherent words without waking up. Natasha felt so</span>
<span class="s0">lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only</span>
<span class="s0">feared the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause,</span>
<span class="s0">such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in</span>
<span class="s0">one's own house, &quot;Uncle,&quot; answering a thought that was in his</span>
<span class="s0">visitors' mind, said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.</span>
<span class="s0">That's it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle's&quot; face was very significant and even handsome as he said</span>
<span class="s0">this. Involuntarily Rostov recalled all the good he had heard about</span>
<span class="s0">him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; had the reputation of being the most honorable and</span>
<span class="s0">disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,</span>
<span class="s0">chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a</span>
<span class="s0">justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused</span>
<span class="s0">public appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on</span>
<span class="s0">his bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown</span>
<span class="s0">garden in summer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why don't you enter the service, Uncle?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That's it, come</span>
<span class="s0">on! I can't make head or tail of it. That's for you--I haven't</span>
<span class="s0">brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter--that's it, come on!</span>
<span class="s0">Open the door, there!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Why have you shut it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen's room, as</span>
<span class="s0">they called the room for the hunt servants.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the</span>
<span class="s0">door into the huntsmen's room, from which came the clear sounds of a</span>
<span class="s0">balalayka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was</span>
<span class="s0">playing. Natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and</span>
<span class="s0">now went out into the passage to hear better.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balalayka.</span>
<span class="s0">I'm fond of it,&quot; said &quot;Uncle.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the</span>
<span class="s0">huntsmen's room when &quot;Uncle&quot; returned from the chase. &quot;Uncle&quot; was fond</span>
<span class="s0">of such music.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How good! Really very good!&quot; said Nicholas with some</span>
<span class="s0">unintentional superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the</span>
<span class="s0">sounds pleased him very much.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very good?&quot; said Natasha reproachfully, noticing her brother's</span>
<span class="s0">tone. &quot;Not 'very good' it's simply delicious!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Just as &quot;Uncle's&quot; pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that</span>
<span class="s0">moment, seemed to her the acme of musical delight.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;More, please, more!&quot; cried Natasha at the door as soon as the</span>
<span class="s0">balalayka ceased. Mitka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the</span>
<span class="s0">balalayka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. &quot;Uncle&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air</span>
<span class="s0">was repeated a hundred times. The balalayka was retuned several</span>
<span class="s0">times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did</span>
<span class="s0">not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. Anisya</span>
<span class="s0">Fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You like listening?&quot; she said to Natasha, with a smile extremely</span>
<span class="s0">like &quot;Uncle's.&quot; &quot;That's a good player of ours,&quot; she added.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He doesn't play that part right!&quot; said &quot;Uncle&quot; suddenly, with an</span>
<span class="s0">energetic gesture. &quot;Here he ought to burst out--that's it, come on!-</span>
<span class="s0">ought to burst out.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you play then?&quot; asked Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; did not answer, but smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Anisya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I</span>
<span class="s0">haven't touched it for a long time. That's it--come on! I've given</span>
<span class="s0">it up.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Anisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her</span>
<span class="s0">errand and brought back the guitar.</span>

<span class="s0">Without looking at anyone, &quot;Uncle&quot; blew the dust off it and, tapping</span>
<span class="s0">the case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself</span>
<span class="s0">in his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard,</span>
<span class="s0">arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a</span>
<span class="s0">wink at Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous,</span>
<span class="s0">and then quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow</span>
<span class="s0">time, not My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the</span>
<span class="s0">street. The tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to</span>
<span class="s0">thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natasha, arousing in them the</span>
<span class="s0">same kind of sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna's whole</span>
<span class="s0">being. Anisya Fedorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her</span>
<span class="s0">face went laughing out of the room. &quot;Uncle&quot; continued to play</span>
<span class="s0">correctly, carefully, with energetic firmness, looking with a</span>
<span class="s0">changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anisya Fedorovna had</span>
<span class="s0">just stood. Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of</span>
<span class="s0">his face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song grew brisker</span>
<span class="s0">and the time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his fingers</span>
<span class="s0">over the strings, something seemed to snap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!&quot; shouted Natasha as soon as he</span>
<span class="s0">had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. &quot;Nicholas,</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas!&quot; she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: &quot;What</span>
<span class="s0">is it moves me so?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas too was greatly pleased by &quot;Uncle's&quot; playing, and &quot;Uncle&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">played the piece over again. Anisya Fedorovna's smiling face</span>
<span class="s0">reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...</span>

    <span class="s0">Fetching water clear and sweet,</span>
    <span class="s0">Stop, dear maiden, I entreat-</span>

<span class="s0">played &quot;Uncle&quot; once more, running his fingers skillfully over the</span>
<span class="s0">strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go on, Uncle dear,&quot; Natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her</span>
<span class="s0">life depended on it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of</span>
<span class="s0">them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow</span>
<span class="s0">struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, niece!&quot; he exclaimed, waving to Natasha the hand that had</span>
<span class="s0">just struck a chord.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to</span>
<span class="s0">face &quot;Uncle,&quot; and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with</span>
<span class="s0">her shoulders and struck an attitude.</span>

<span class="s0">Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an emigree</span>
<span class="s0">French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that</span>
<span class="s0">spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale* would, one</span>
<span class="s0">would have supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the</span>
<span class="s0">movements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; had expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and</span>
<span class="s0">smiled triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that</span>
<span class="s0">had at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do</span>
<span class="s0">the right thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.</span>


<span class="s0">*The French shawl dance.</span>


<span class="s0">She did the right thing with such precision, such complete</span>
<span class="s0">precision, that Anisya Fedorovna, who had at once handed her the</span>
<span class="s0">handkerchief she needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though</span>
<span class="s0">she laughed as she watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in</span>
<span class="s0">silks and velvets and so different from herself, who yet was able to</span>
<span class="s0">understand all that was in Anisya and in Anisya's father and mother</span>
<span class="s0">and aunt, and in every Russian man and woman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, little countess; that's it--come on!&quot; cried &quot;Uncle,&quot; with a</span>
<span class="s0">joyous laugh, having finished the dance. &quot;Well done, niece! Now a fine</span>
<span class="s0">young fellow must be found as husband for you. That's it--come on!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's chosen already,&quot; said Nicholas smiling.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh?&quot; said &quot;Uncle&quot; in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">who nodded her head with a happy smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And such a one!&quot; she said. But as soon as she had said it a new</span>
<span class="s0">train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. &quot;What did Nicholas' smile</span>
<span class="s0">mean when he said 'chosen already'? Is he glad of it or not? It is</span>
<span class="s0">as if he thought my Bolkonski would not approve of or understand our</span>
<span class="s0">gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?&quot; she thought,</span>
<span class="s0">and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a second.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Don't dare to think about it,&quot; she said to herself, and sat down</span>
<span class="s0">again smilingly beside &quot;Uncle,&quot; begging him to play something more.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; played another song and a valse; then after a pause he</span>
<span class="s0">cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:</span>

    <span class="s0">As 'twas growing dark last night</span>
    <span class="s0">Fell the snow so soft and light...</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; sang as peasants sing, with full and naive conviction that</span>
<span class="s0">the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune</span>
<span class="s0">comes of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which</span>
<span class="s0">exists only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the</span>
<span class="s0">unconsidered tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily</span>
<span class="s0">good. Natasha was in ecstasies over &quot;Uncle's&quot; singing. She resolved to</span>
<span class="s0">give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Uncle&quot; for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song.</span>

<span class="s0">After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been</span>
<span class="s0">sent to look for them, arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya. The count</span>
<span class="s0">and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious,</span>
<span class="s0">said one of the men.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two</span>
<span class="s0">traps. Natasha and Nicholas got into the other. &quot;Uncle&quot; wrapped</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness.</span>
<span class="s0">He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be</span>
<span class="s0">crossed, so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent</span>
<span class="s0">huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by, dear niece,&quot; his voice called out of the darkness--not the</span>
<span class="s0">voice Natasha had known previously, but the one that had sung As 'twas</span>
<span class="s0">growing dark last night.</span>

<span class="s0">In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a</span>
<span class="s0">cheerful smell of smoke.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a darling Uncle is!&quot; said Natasha, when they had come out onto</span>
<span class="s0">the highroad.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Nicholas. &quot;You're not cold?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No. I'm quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!&quot; answered</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long</span>
<span class="s0">while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but</span>
<span class="s0">only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.</span>

<span class="s0">What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly</span>
<span class="s0">caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did</span>
<span class="s0">they all find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were</span>
<span class="s0">nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As 'twas growing dark</span>
<span class="s0">last night--the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get</span>
<span class="s0">and had at last caught.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Got it?&quot; said Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?&quot; inquired Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">They were fond of asking one another that question.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I?&quot; said Nicholas, trying to remember. &quot;Well, you see, first I</span>
<span class="s0">thought that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were</span>
<span class="s0">a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then</span>
<span class="s0">for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don't you think so?...</span>
<span class="s0">Well, and you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving</span>
<span class="s0">along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows</span>
<span class="s0">where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive</span>
<span class="s0">and suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe, but in Fairyland. And</span>
<span class="s0">then I thought... No, nothing else.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know, I expect you thought of him,&quot; said Nicholas, smiling as</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha knew by the sound of his voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; said Natasha, though she had in reality been thinking about</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would</span>
<span class="s0">have liked &quot;Uncle.&quot; &quot;And then I was saying to myself all the way, 'How</span>
<span class="s0">well Anisya carried herself, how well!'&quot; And Nicholas heard her</span>
<span class="s0">spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. &quot;And do you know,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly said, &quot;I know that I shall never again be as happy and</span>
<span class="s0">tranquil as I am now.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!&quot; exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;How charming this Natasha of mine is! I have no other friend like her</span>
<span class="s0">and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive</span>
<span class="s0">about together!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!&quot; thought Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, there are still lights in the drawingroom!&quot; she said,</span>
<span class="s0">pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the</span>
<span class="s0">moist velvety darkness of the night.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">Count Ilya Rostov had resigned the position of Marshal of the</span>
<span class="s0">Nobility because it involved him in too much expense, but still his</span>
<span class="s0">affairs did not improve. Natasha and Nicholas often noticed their</span>
<span class="s0">parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard</span>
<span class="s0">suggestions of selling the fine ancestral Rostov house and estate near</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. It was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the</span>
<span class="s0">count had been Marshal, and life at Otradnoe was quieter than in</span>
<span class="s0">former years, but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of</span>
<span class="s0">people and more than twenty sat down to table every day. These were</span>
<span class="s0">all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as</span>
<span class="s0">members of the family, or persons who were, it seemed, obliged to live</span>
<span class="s0">in the count's house. Such were Dimmler the musician and his wife,</span>
<span class="s0">Vogel the dancing master and his family, Belova, an old maiden lady,</span>
<span class="s0">an inmate of the house, and many others such as Petya's tutors, the</span>
<span class="s0">girls' former governess, and other people who simply found it</span>
<span class="s0">preferable and more advantageous to live in the count's house than</span>
<span class="s0">at home. They had not as many visitors as before, but the old habits</span>
<span class="s0">of life without which the count and countess could not conceive of</span>
<span class="s0">existence remained unchanged. There was still the hunting</span>
<span class="s0">establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the same fifty</span>
<span class="s0">horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive</span>
<span class="s0">presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days;</span>
<span class="s0">there were still the count's games of whist and boston, at which-</span>
<span class="s0">spreading out his cards so that everybody could see them--he let</span>
<span class="s0">himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors,</span>
<span class="s0">who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count Rostov as a</span>
<span class="s0">most profitable source of income.</span>

<span class="s0">The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to</span>
<span class="s0">believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every</span>
<span class="s0">step, and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work</span>
<span class="s0">carefully and patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her</span>
<span class="s0">loving heart, felt that her children were being ruined, that it was</span>
<span class="s0">not the count's fault for he could not help being what he was--that</span>
<span class="s0">(though he tried to hide it) he himself suffered from the</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness of his own and his children's ruin, and she tried to</span>
<span class="s0">find means of remedying the position. From her feminine point of</span>
<span class="s0">view she could see only one solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry</span>
<span class="s0">a rich heiress. She felt this to be their last hope and that if</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas refused the match she had found for him, she would have to</span>
<span class="s0">abandon the hope of ever getting matters right. This match was with</span>
<span class="s0">Julie Karagina, the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents, a girl</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs had known from childhood, and who had now become a wealthy</span>
<span class="s0">heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess had written direct to Julie's mother in Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a</span>
<span class="s0">favorable answer from her. Karagina had replied that for her part</span>
<span class="s0">she was agreeable, and everything depend on her daughter's</span>
<span class="s0">inclination. She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son</span>
<span class="s0">that now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him</span>
<span class="s0">married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that</span>
<span class="s0">were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid</span>
<span class="s0">girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.</span>

<span class="s0">At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his</span>
<span class="s0">mother's remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations</span>
<span class="s0">induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope of</span>
<span class="s0">getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie</span>
<span class="s0">Karagina.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would you</span>
<span class="s0">expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of</span>
<span class="s0">money?&quot; he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question</span>
<span class="s0">and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, you have not understood me,&quot; said his mother, not knowing how</span>
<span class="s0">to justify herself. &quot;You have not understood me, Nikolenka. It is your</span>
<span class="s0">happiness I wish for,&quot; she added, feeling that she was telling an</span>
<span class="s0">untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, don't cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I</span>
<span class="s0">will give my life, anything, to put you at ease,&quot; said Nicholas. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">would sacrifice anything for you--even my feelings.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did</span>
<span class="s0">not want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a</span>
<span class="s0">sacrifice for him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, you have not understood me, don't let us talk about it,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">replied, wiping away her tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Maybe I do love a poor girl,&quot; said Nicholas to himself. &quot;Am I to</span>
<span class="s0">sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could</span>
<span class="s0">speak so to me. Because Sonya is poor I must not love her,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">thought, &quot;must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should</span>
<span class="s0">certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can</span>
<span class="s0">always sacrifice my feelings for my family's welfare,&quot; he said to</span>
<span class="s0">himself, &quot;but I can't coerce my feelings. If I love Sonya, that</span>
<span class="s0">feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the</span>
<span class="s0">conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment</span>
<span class="s0">between her son and the portionless Sonya. Though she blamed herself</span>
<span class="s0">for it, she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sonya,</span>
<span class="s0">often pulling her up without reason, addressing her stiffly as &quot;my</span>
<span class="s0">dear,&quot; and using the formal &quot;you&quot; instead of the intimate &quot;thou&quot; in</span>
<span class="s0">speaking to her. The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya because that poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind,</span>
<span class="s0">so devotedly grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully,</span>
<span class="s0">unchangingly, and unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were</span>
<span class="s0">no grounds for finding fault with her.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter</span>
<span class="s0">had come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he</span>
<span class="s0">would have been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound</span>
<span class="s0">unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to</span>
<span class="s0">defer his return till the beginning of the new year. Natasha was still</span>
<span class="s0">as much in love with her betrothed, found the same comfort in that</span>
<span class="s0">love, and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures</span>
<span class="s0">of life as before; but at the end of the fourth month of their</span>
<span class="s0">separation she began to have fits of depression which she could not</span>
<span class="s0">master. She felt sorry for herself: sorry that she was being wasted</span>
<span class="s0">all this time and of no use to anyone--while she felt herself so</span>
<span class="s0">capable of loving and being loved.</span>

<span class="s0">Things were not cheerful in the Rostovs' home.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and</span>
<span class="s0">wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and</span>
<span class="s0">the new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities,</span>
<span class="s0">though the calm frost of twenty degrees Reaumur, the dazzling sunshine</span>
<span class="s0">by day, and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some</span>
<span class="s0">special celebration of the season.</span>

<span class="s0">On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the</span>
<span class="s0">inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest</span>
<span class="s0">time of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that</span>
<span class="s0">morning, was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was</span>
<span class="s0">resting in his study. Sonya sat in the drawing room at the round</span>
<span class="s0">table, copying a design for embroidery. The countess was playing</span>
<span class="s0">patience. Nastasya Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the</span>
<span class="s0">window with two old ladies. Natasha came into the room, went up to</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya, glanced at what she was doing, and then went up to her mother</span>
<span class="s0">and stood without speaking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why are you wandering about like an outcast?&quot; asked her mother.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;What do you want?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!&quot; said Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't look at me, Mamma! Don't look; I shall cry directly.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sit down with me a little,&quot; said the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned</span>
<span class="s0">quickly to hide them and left the room.</span>

<span class="s0">She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and</span>
<span class="s0">then went into the maids' room. There an old maidservant was grumbling</span>
<span class="s0">at a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold</span>
<span class="s0">from the serfs' quarters.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stop playing--there's a time for everything,&quot; said the old woman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let her alone, Kondratevna,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Go, Mavrushka, go.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went</span>
<span class="s0">to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing</span>
<span class="s0">cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What can I do with them?&quot; thought Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Nikita, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the</span>
<span class="s0">yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some</span>
<span class="s0">oats.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just a few oats?&quot; said Misha, cheerfully and readily.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go, go quickly,&quot; the old man urged him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">On her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a</span>
<span class="s0">samovar, though it was not at all the time for tea.</span>

<span class="s0">Foka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order</span>
<span class="s0">and asked whether the samovar was really wanted.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh dear, what a young lady!&quot; said Foka, pretending to frown at</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble</span>
<span class="s0">as Natasha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to</span>
<span class="s0">send them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of</span>
<span class="s0">them would get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no</span>
<span class="s0">one's orders so readily as they did hers. &quot;What can I do, where can</span>
<span class="s0">I go?&quot; thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?&quot; she asked</span>
<span class="s0">the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman's jacket.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,&quot; answered the buffoon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord, O Lord, it's always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am</span>
<span class="s0">I to do with myself?&quot; And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly</span>
<span class="s0">upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.</span>

<span class="s0">Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which</span>
<span class="s0">were plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were</span>
<span class="s0">discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">sat down, listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air,</span>
<span class="s0">and then got up again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The island of Madagascar,&quot; she said, &quot;Ma-da-gas-car,&quot; she repeated,</span>
<span class="s0">articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame</span>
<span class="s0">Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Her brother Petya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on</span>
<span class="s0">him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Petya! Petya!&quot; she called to him. &quot;Carry me downstairs.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Petya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her</span>
<span class="s0">arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, don't... the island of Madagascar!&quot; she said, and jumping off</span>
<span class="s0">his back she went downstairs.</span>

<span class="s0">Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made</span>
<span class="s0">sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was</span>
<span class="s0">dull, Natasha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar,</span>
<span class="s0">sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her</span>
<span class="s0">fingers over the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she</span>
<span class="s0">recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew.</span>
<span class="s0">What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other</span>
<span class="s0">listeners, but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences</span>
<span class="s0">arose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes</span>
<span class="s0">fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and</span>
<span class="s0">listened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on</span>
<span class="s0">the past.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha glanced</span>
<span class="s0">at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her</span>
<span class="s0">that she remembered the light failing through that crack once before</span>
<span class="s0">and Sonya passing with a glass in her hand. &quot;Yes it was exactly the</span>
<span class="s0">same,&quot; thought Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, what is this?&quot; she cried, twanging a thick string.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, you are there!&quot; said Sonya with a start, and came near and</span>
<span class="s0">listened. &quot;I don't know. A storm?&quot; she ventured timidly, afraid of</span>
<span class="s0">being wrong.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There! That's just how she started and just how she came up smiling</span>
<span class="s0">timidly when all this happened before,&quot; thought Natasha, &quot;and in</span>
<span class="s0">just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, it's the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!&quot; and Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it. &quot;Where</span>
<span class="s0">were you going?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You always find something to do, but I can't,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;And</span>
<span class="s0">where's Nicholas?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Asleep, I think.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, go and wake him,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Tell him I want him to come</span>
<span class="s0">and sing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened</span>
<span class="s0">before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all</span>
<span class="s0">regretting not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time</span>
<span class="s0">when she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover's eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!</span>
<span class="s0">And, worst of all, I am growing old--that's the thing! There won't</span>
<span class="s0">then be in me what there is now. But perhaps he'll come today, will</span>
<span class="s0">come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.&quot; She rose,</span>
<span class="s0">put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were</span>
<span class="s0">already at the tea table. The servants stood round the table--but</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, here she is!&quot; said the old count, when he saw Natasha enter.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Well, sit down by me.&quot; But Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced</span>
<span class="s0">round as if looking for something.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma!&quot; she muttered, &quot;give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,</span>
<span class="s0">quickly!&quot; and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between</span>
<span class="s0">the elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. &quot;My God, my</span>
<span class="s0">God! The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing</span>
<span class="s0">in the same way!&quot; thought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense of</span>
<span class="s0">repulsion rising up in her for the whole household, because they</span>
<span class="s0">were always the same.</span>

<span class="s0">After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting room, to</span>
<span class="s0">their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Does it ever happen to you,&quot; said Natasha to her brother, when</span>
<span class="s0">they settled down in the sitting room, &quot;does it ever happen to you</span>
<span class="s0">to feel as if there were nothing more to come--nothing; that</span>
<span class="s0">everything good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I should think so!&quot; he replied. &quot;I have felt like that when</span>
<span class="s0">everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has</span>
<span class="s0">come into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must</span>
<span class="s0">all die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where</span>
<span class="s0">there was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!&quot; Natasha interrupted him. &quot;When I</span>
<span class="s0">was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I</span>
<span class="s0">was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat</span>
<span class="s0">sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and</span>
<span class="s0">sorry for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was</span>
<span class="s0">innocent--that was the chief thing,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Do you remember?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I remember,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;I remember that I came to you</span>
<span class="s0">afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt</span>
<span class="s0">ashamed to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and</span>
<span class="s0">wanted to give it to you. Do you remember?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And do you remember,&quot; Natasha asked with a pensive smile, &quot;how</span>
<span class="s0">once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us</span>
<span class="s0">into the study--that was in the old house--and it was dark--we went in</span>
<span class="s0">and suddenly there stood...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A Negro,&quot; chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. &quot;Of course</span>
<span class="s0">I remember. Even now I don't know whether there really was a Negro, or</span>
<span class="s0">if we only dreamed it or were told about him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and</span>
<span class="s0">looked at us...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, do you remember?&quot; asked Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, I do remember something too,&quot; Sonya answered timidly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, &quot;and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you</span>
<span class="s0">remember!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How strange it is! It's as if it were a dream! I like that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,</span>
<span class="s0">and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was</span>
<span class="s0">that real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun</span>
<span class="s0">in the porch?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not</span>
<span class="s0">the sad memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones--those</span>
<span class="s0">impressions of one's most distant past in which dreams and realities</span>
<span class="s0">blend--and they laughed with quiet enjoyment.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they</span>
<span class="s0">shared the same reminiscences.</span>

<span class="s0">Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she</span>
<span class="s0">recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced.</span>
<span class="s0">She simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.</span>

<span class="s0">She only really took part when they recalled Sonya's first</span>
<span class="s0">arrival. She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because</span>
<span class="s0">he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too,</span>
<span class="s0">would be sewn up with cords.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a</span>
<span class="s0">cabbage,&quot; said Natasha, &quot;and I remember that I dared not disbelieve</span>
<span class="s0">it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other</span>
<span class="s0">door of the sitting room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They have brought the cock, Miss,&quot; she said in a whisper.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It isn't wanted, Petya. Tell them to take it away,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and</span>
<span class="s0">went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its</span>
<span class="s0">cloth covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,&quot; came the</span>
<span class="s0">old countess' voice from the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natasha, Nicholas, and Sonya,</span>
<span class="s0">remarked: &quot;How quiet you young people are!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, we're philosophizing,&quot; said Natasha, glancing round for a</span>
<span class="s0">moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now</span>
<span class="s0">discussing dreams.</span>

<span class="s0">Dimmler began to play; Natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the</span>
<span class="s0">table, took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself</span>
<span class="s0">quietly in her former place. It was dark in the room especially</span>
<span class="s0">where they were sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the</span>
<span class="s0">silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished</span>
<span class="s0">the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know,&quot; said Natasha in a whisper, moving closer to</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas and Sonya, &quot;that when one goes on and on recalling</span>
<span class="s0">memories, one at last begins to remember what happened before one</span>
<span class="s0">was in the world...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is metempsychosis,&quot; said Sonya, who had always learned well,</span>
<span class="s0">and remembered everything. &quot;The Egyptians believed that our souls have</span>
<span class="s0">lived in animals, and will go back into animals again.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I don't believe we ever were in animals,&quot; said Natasha, still</span>
<span class="s0">in a whisper though the music had ceased. &quot;But I am certain that we</span>
<span class="s0">were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we</span>
<span class="s0">remember....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May I join you?&quot; said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat</span>
<span class="s0">down by them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?&quot; said Nicholas.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;No, that can't be!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was</span>
<span class="s0">before?&quot; Natasha rejoined with conviction. &quot;The soul is immortal--well</span>
<span class="s0">then, if I shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a</span>
<span class="s0">whole eternity.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,&quot; remarked</span>
<span class="s0">Dimmler, who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending</span>
<span class="s0">smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why is it hard to imagine eternity?&quot; said Natasha. &quot;It is now</span>
<span class="s0">today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday,</span>
<span class="s0">and the day before...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha! Now it's your turn. Sing me something,&quot; they heard the</span>
<span class="s0">countess say. &quot;Why are you sitting there like conspirators?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, I don't at all want to,&quot; replied Natasha, but all the same</span>
<span class="s0">she rose.</span>

<span class="s0">None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break</span>
<span class="s0">off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as</span>
<span class="s0">usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the</span>
<span class="s0">resonance was best, Natasha began to sing her mother's favorite song.</span>

<span class="s0">She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had</span>
<span class="s0">sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The</span>
<span class="s0">count, from his study where he was talking to Mitenka, heard her</span>
<span class="s0">and, like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in</span>
<span class="s0">his talk while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped,</span>
<span class="s0">while Mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling.</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in</span>
<span class="s0">time with her. Sonya, as she listened, thought of the immense</span>
<span class="s0">difference there was between herself and her friend, and how</span>
<span class="s0">impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her</span>
<span class="s0">cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with</span>
<span class="s0">tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She thought of</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha and of her own youth, and of how there was something unnatural</span>
<span class="s0">and dreadful in this impending marriage of Natasha and Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with</span>
<span class="s0">closed eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Countess,&quot; he said at last, &quot;that's a European talent, she</span>
<span class="s0">has nothing to learn--what softness, tenderness, and strength....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!&quot; said the countess,</span>
<span class="s0">not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her</span>
<span class="s0">that Natasha had too much of something, and that because of this she</span>
<span class="s0">would not be happy. Before Natasha had finished singing,</span>
<span class="s0">fourteen-year-old Petya rushed in delightedly, to say that some</span>
<span class="s0">mummers had arrived.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha stopped abruptly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Idiot!&quot; she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair,</span>
<span class="s0">threw herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop</span>
<span class="s0">for a long time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's nothing, Mamma, really it's nothing; only Petya startled</span>
<span class="s0">me,&quot; she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs</span>
<span class="s0">still choked her.</span>

<span class="s0">The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,</span>
<span class="s0">innkeepers, and ladies--frightening and funny--bringing in with them</span>
<span class="s0">the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first</span>
<span class="s0">timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed</span>
<span class="s0">into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily</span>
<span class="s0">and heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas</span>
<span class="s0">games. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their</span>
<span class="s0">costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,</span>
<span class="s0">smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had</span>
<span class="s0">disappeared.</span>

<span class="s0">Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the</span>
<span class="s0">ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt--this was Nicholas. A Turkish</span>
<span class="s0">girl was Petya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natasha, and a</span>
<span class="s0">Circassian was Sonya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.</span>

<span class="s0">After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from</span>
<span class="s0">those who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided</span>
<span class="s0">that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown</span>
<span class="s0">elsewhere.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to</span>
<span class="s0">take them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them</span>
<span class="s0">about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to &quot;Uncle's.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, why disturb the old fellow?&quot; said the countess. &quot;Besides, you</span>
<span class="s0">wouldn't have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the</span>
<span class="s0">Melyukovs'.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Melyukova was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and</span>
<span class="s0">governesses, lived three miles from the Rostovs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's right, my dear,&quot; chimed in the old count, thoroughly</span>
<span class="s0">aroused. &quot;I'll dress up at once and go with them. I'll make Pashette</span>
<span class="s0">open her eyes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad</span>
<span class="s0">leg all these last days. It was decided that the count must not go,</span>
<span class="s0">but that if Louisa Ivanovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the</span>
<span class="s0">young ladies might go to the Melyukovs', Sonya, generally so timid and</span>
<span class="s0">shy, more urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivanovna not to refuse.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya's costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows</span>
<span class="s0">were extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very</span>
<span class="s0">handsome, and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with</span>
<span class="s0">her. Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be</span>
<span class="s0">decided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person.</span>
<span class="s0">Louisa Ivanovna consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka</span>
<span class="s0">sleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking and</span>
<span class="s0">whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing</span>
<span class="s0">from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax</span>
<span class="s0">when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs,</span>
<span class="s0">talking, calling to one another, laughing, and shouting.</span>

<span class="s0">Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was</span>
<span class="s0">the old count's with a trotter from the Orlov stud as shaft horse, the</span>
<span class="s0">fourth was Nicholas' own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, in his old lady's dress over which he had belted his</span>
<span class="s0">hussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.</span>

<span class="s0">It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the</span>
<span class="s0">metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked</span>
<span class="s0">round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, Sonya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas'</span>
<span class="s0">sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Petya, into the old count's, and the</span>
<span class="s0">rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You go ahead, Zakhar!&quot; shouted Nicholas to his father's coachman,</span>
<span class="s0">wishing for a chance to race past him.</span>

<span class="s0">The old count's troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,</span>
<span class="s0">squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its</span>
<span class="s0">deep-toned bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts</span>
<span class="s0">of the middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered</span>
<span class="s0">like sugar, and threw it up.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the</span>
<span class="s0">others moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove</span>
<span class="s0">at a steady trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the</span>
<span class="s0">garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and</span>
<span class="s0">hid the brilliant moonlight, but as soon as they were past the</span>
<span class="s0">fence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out</span>
<span class="s0">before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish</span>
<span class="s0">shadows. Bang, bang! went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the</span>
<span class="s0">snow of the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same</span>
<span class="s0">way, and rudely breaking the frost-bound stillness, the troykas</span>
<span class="s0">began to speed along the road, one after the other.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A hare's track, a lot of tracks!&quot; rang out Natasha's voice</span>
<span class="s0">through the frost-bound air.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How light it is, Nicholas!&quot; came Sonya's voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas glanced round at Sonya, and bent down to see her face</span>
<span class="s0">closer. Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches</span>
<span class="s0">peeped up at him from her sable furs--so close and yet so distant-</span>
<span class="s0">in the moonlight.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That used to be Sonya,&quot; thought he, and looked at her closer and</span>
<span class="s0">smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it, Nicholas?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing,&quot; said he and turned again to the horses.</span>

<span class="s0">When they came out onto the beaten highroad--polished by sleigh</span>
<span class="s0">runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were</span>
<span class="s0">visible in the moonlight--the horses began to tug at the reins of</span>
<span class="s0">their own accord and increased their pace. The near side horse,</span>
<span class="s0">arching his head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his</span>
<span class="s0">traces. The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears as</span>
<span class="s0">if asking: &quot;Isn't it time to begin now?&quot; In front, already far ahead</span>
<span class="s0">the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off, the black</span>
<span class="s0">horses driven by Zakhar could be clearly seen against the white</span>
<span class="s0">snow. From that sleigh one could hear the shouts, laughter, and voices</span>
<span class="s0">of the mummers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Gee up, my darlings!&quot; shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one</span>
<span class="s0">side and flourishing the whip.</span>

<span class="s0">It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given</span>
<span class="s0">by the side horses who pulled harder--ever increasing their gallop-</span>
<span class="s0">that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back.</span>
<span class="s0">With screams squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft</span>
<span class="s0">horses to gallop--the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung</span>
<span class="s0">steadily beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of</span>
<span class="s0">slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and</span>
<span class="s0">coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where are we?&quot; thought he. &quot;It's the Kosoy meadow, I suppose. But</span>
<span class="s0">no--this is something new I've never seen before. This isn't the Kosoy</span>
<span class="s0">meadow nor the Demkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is! It is</span>
<span class="s0">something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...&quot; And shouting</span>
<span class="s0">to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.</span>

<span class="s0">Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face, which was already</span>
<span class="s0">covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhar, stretching out his</span>
<span class="s0">arms, clucked his tongue and let his horses go.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, look out, master!&quot; he cried.</span>

<span class="s0">Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved the</span>
<span class="s0">feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.</span>
<span class="s0">Zakhar, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with</span>
<span class="s0">the reins.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No you won't, master!&quot; he shouted.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar. The</span>
<span class="s0">horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh-</span>
<span class="s0">beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused</span>
<span class="s0">glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they</span>
<span class="s0">were passing. The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the</span>
<span class="s0">voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides.</span>

<span class="s0">Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were</span>
<span class="s0">still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled</span>
<span class="s0">with stars.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the</span>
<span class="s0">left?&quot; thought Nicholas. &quot;Are we getting to the Melyukovs'? Is this</span>
<span class="s0">Melyukovka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows</span>
<span class="s0">what is happening to us--but it is very strange and pleasant</span>
<span class="s0">whatever it is.&quot; And he looked round in the sleigh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!&quot; said one of the</span>
<span class="s0">strange, pretty, unfamiliar people--the one with fine eyebrows and</span>
<span class="s0">mustache.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think this used to be Natasha,&quot; thought Nicholas, &quot;and that was</span>
<span class="s0">Madame Schoss, but perhaps it's not, and this Circassian with the</span>
<span class="s0">mustache I don't know, but I love her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Aren't you cold?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh</span>
<span class="s0">behind shouted something--probably something funny--but they could not</span>
<span class="s0">make out what he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; some voices answered, laughing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a</span>
<span class="s0">glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver</span>
<span class="s0">roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And</span>
<span class="s0">if this is really Melyukovka, it is still stranger that we drove</span>
<span class="s0">heaven knows where and have come to Melyukovka,&quot; thought Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">It really was Melyukovka, and maids and footmen with merry faces</span>
<span class="s0">came running, out to the porch carrying candles.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who is it?&quot; asked someone in the porch.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The mummers from the count's. I know by the horses,&quot; replied some</span>
<span class="s0">voices.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova, a broadly built, energetic woman</span>
<span class="s0">wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress,</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling</span>
<span class="s0">dull. They were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at</span>
<span class="s0">the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard</span>
<span class="s0">the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.</span>

<span class="s0">Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their</span>
<span class="s0">throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,</span>
<span class="s0">came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The</span>
<span class="s0">clown--Dimmler--and the lady--Nicholas--started a dance. Surrounded by</span>
<span class="s0">the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and</span>
<span class="s0">disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged</span>
<span class="s0">themselves about the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear me! there's no recognizing them! And Natasha! See whom she</span>
<span class="s0">looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler--isn't</span>
<span class="s0">he good! I didn't know him! And how he dances. Dear me, there's a</span>
<span class="s0">Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear Sonya. And who is that?</span>
<span class="s0">Well, you have cheered us up! Nikita and Vanya--clear away the tables!</span>
<span class="s0">And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar!</span>
<span class="s0">Just like a boy! And the legs!... I can't look at him...&quot; different</span>
<span class="s0">voices were saying.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, the young Melyukovs' favorite, disappeared with them into</span>
<span class="s0">the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male</span>
<span class="s0">garments were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish</span>
<span class="s0">arms from behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young</span>
<span class="s0">Melyukovs joined the mummers.</span>

<span class="s0">Pelageya Danilovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the</span>
<span class="s0">visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,</span>
<span class="s0">went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles,</span>
<span class="s0">peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to</span>
<span class="s0">recognize any of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostovs she</span>
<span class="s0">failed to recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters,</span>
<span class="s0">or her late husband's, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put</span>
<span class="s0">on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And who is is this?&quot; she asked her governess, peering into the face</span>
<span class="s0">of her own daughter dressed up as a Kazan-Tartar. &quot;I suppose it is one</span>
<span class="s0">of the Rostovs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve</span>
<span class="s0">in?&quot; she asked Natasha. &quot;Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">ordered the butler who was handing things round. &quot;That's not forbidden</span>
<span class="s0">by his law.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by</span>
<span class="s0">the dancers, who--having decided once for all that being disguised, no</span>
<span class="s0">one would recognize them--were not at all shy, Pelageya Danilovna</span>
<span class="s0">hid her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook</span>
<span class="s0">with irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My little Sasha! Look at Sasha!&quot; she said.</span>

<span class="s0">After Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelageya Danilovna</span>
<span class="s0">made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a</span>
<span class="s0">string, and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games</span>
<span class="s0">together.</span>

<span class="s0">In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The</span>
<span class="s0">corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring,</span>
<span class="s0">flushed, and merry faces. Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the</span>
<span class="s0">mummers, admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly</span>
<span class="s0">how they suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for</span>
<span class="s0">having entertained her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room, and the serfs had something served to them in the</span>
<span class="s0">ballroom.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now to tell one's fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs, during supper.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why?&quot; said the eldest Melyukov girl.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You wouldn't go, it takes courage...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tell what happened to the young lady!&quot; said the second Melyukov</span>
<span class="s0">girl.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; began the old maid, &quot;a young lady once went out, took a</span>
<span class="s0">cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After</span>
<span class="s0">sitting a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh</span>
<span class="s0">drives up with harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in,</span>
<span class="s0">just in the shape of a man, like an officer--comes in and sits down to</span>
<span class="s0">table with her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; screamed Natasha, rolling her eyes with horror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes? And how... did he speak?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began</span>
<span class="s0">persuading her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow,</span>
<span class="s0">but she got frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her</span>
<span class="s0">hands. Then he caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just</span>
<span class="s0">then...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, why frighten them?&quot; said Pelageya Danilovna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...&quot; said her daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how does one do it in a barn?&quot; inquired Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on</span>
<span class="s0">what you hear; hammering and knocking--that's bad; but a sound of</span>
<span class="s0">shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pelageya Danilovna smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I've forgotten...&quot; she replied. &quot;But none of you would go?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I will; Pelageya Danilovna, let me! I'll go,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, why not, if you're not afraid?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Louisa Ivanovna, may I?&quot; asked Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game</span>
<span class="s0">or talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sonya's side, and gazed at</span>
<span class="s0">her with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today,</span>
<span class="s0">thanks to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to</span>
<span class="s0">know her. And really, that evening, Sonya was brighter, more animated,</span>
<span class="s0">and prettier than Nicholas had ever seen her before.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So that's what she is like; what a fool I have been!&quot; he thought</span>
<span class="s0">gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous</span>
<span class="s0">smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'm not afraid of anything,&quot; said Sonya. &quot;May I go at once?&quot; She</span>
<span class="s0">got up.</span>

<span class="s0">They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and</span>
<span class="s0">listen, and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her</span>
<span class="s0">head and shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a darling that girl is!&quot; thought he. &quot;And what have I been</span>
<span class="s0">thinking of till now?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went</span>
<span class="s0">hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of</span>
<span class="s0">people really had made the house stuffy.</span>

<span class="s0">Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but</span>
<span class="s0">even brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow</span>
<span class="s0">sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the</span>
<span class="s0">sky and the real stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary,</span>
<span class="s0">while the earth was gay.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of</span>
<span class="s0">the house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sonya</span>
<span class="s0">would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood</span>
<span class="s0">and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old</span>
<span class="s0">lime trees fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the</span>
<span class="s0">barn. The log walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked</span>
<span class="s0">as if hewn out of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A</span>
<span class="s0">tree in the garden snapped with the frost, and then all was again</span>
<span class="s0">perfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the</span>
<span class="s0">strength of eternal youth and gladness.</span>

<span class="s0">From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the</span>
<span class="s0">bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he</span>
<span class="s0">heard the voice of an old maidservant saying, &quot;Straight, straight,</span>
<span class="s0">along the path, Miss. Only, don't look back.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am not afraid,&quot; answered Sonya's voice, and along the path toward</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sonya's feet in her</span>
<span class="s0">thin shoes.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of</span>
<span class="s0">paces away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">she had known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman's dress,</span>
<span class="s0">with tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sonya. She ran rapidly</span>
<span class="s0">toward him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite different and yet the same,&quot; thought Nicholas, looking at her</span>
<span class="s0">face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the</span>
<span class="s0">cloak that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and</span>
<span class="s0">kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt</span>
<span class="s0">cork. Sonya kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little</span>
<span class="s0">hands pressed them to his cheeks.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya!... Nicholas!&quot;... was all they said. They ran to the barn and</span>
<span class="s0">then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back</span>
<span class="s0">porch.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">When they all drove back from Pelageya Danilovna's, Natasha, who</span>
<span class="s0">always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss</span>
<span class="s0">should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sonya with Nicholas and</span>
<span class="s0">the maids.</span>

<span class="s0">On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing</span>
<span class="s0">and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sonya's</span>
<span class="s0">face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former</span>
<span class="s0">and his present Sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted</span>
<span class="s0">again. He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya, and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the</span>
<span class="s0">sensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty air with a full breast</span>
<span class="s0">and, looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling</span>
<span class="s0">sky, felt himself again in fairyland.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, is it well with thee?&quot; he asked from time to time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes!&quot; she replied. &quot;And with thee?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and</span>
<span class="s0">ran for a moment to Natasha's sleigh and stood on its wing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha!&quot; he whispered in French, &quot;do you know I have made up my</span>
<span class="s0">mind about Sonya?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you told her?&quot; asked Natasha, suddenly beaming all over with</span>
<span class="s0">joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha--are you glad?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I</span>
<span class="s0">did not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart</span>
<span class="s0">she has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be</span>
<span class="s0">happy while Sonya was not,&quot; continued Natasha. &quot;Now I am so glad!</span>
<span class="s0">Well, run back to her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!&quot; cried Nicholas, peering</span>
<span class="s0">into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual,</span>
<span class="s0">and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, it's magical, isn't it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;You have done splendidly.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Had I seen her before as she is now,&quot; thought Nicholas, &quot;I should</span>
<span class="s0">long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,</span>
<span class="s0">and all would have been well.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you are glad and I have done right?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.</span>
<span class="s0">Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing!</span>
<span class="s0">I nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya, for there is nothing but good in her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then it's all right?&quot; said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the</span>
<span class="s0">expression of his sister's face to see if she was in earnest. Then</span>
<span class="s0">he jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his</span>
<span class="s0">sleigh. The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and</span>
<span class="s0">beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting</span>
<span class="s0">there, and that Circassian was Sonya, and that Sonya was certainly his</span>
<span class="s0">future happy and loving wife.</span>

<span class="s0">When they reached home and had told their mother how they had</span>
<span class="s0">spent the evening at the Melyukovs', the girls went to their</span>
<span class="s0">bedroom. When they had undressed, but without washing off the cork</span>
<span class="s0">mustaches, they sat a long time talking of their happiness. They</span>
<span class="s0">talked of how they would live when they were married, how their</span>
<span class="s0">husbands would be friends, and how happy they would be. On Natasha's</span>
<span class="s0">table stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had prepared</span>
<span class="s0">beforehand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too</span>
<span class="s0">good!&quot; said Natasha, rising and going to the looking glasses.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you'll see him,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking</span>
<span class="s0">glasses, and sat down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I see someone with a mustache,&quot; said Natasha, seeing her own face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You mustn't laugh, Miss,&quot; said Dunyasha.</span>

<span class="s0">With Sonya's help and the maid's, Natasha got the glass she held</span>
<span class="s0">into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious</span>
<span class="s0">expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the</span>
<span class="s0">receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting</span>
<span class="s0">(from tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew,</span>
<span class="s0">in that last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was</span>
<span class="s0">to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin,</span>
<span class="s0">she saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the</span>
<span class="s0">looking glasses.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why is it others see things and I don't?&quot; she said. &quot;You sit down</span>
<span class="s0">now, Sonya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I</span>
<span class="s0">feel so frightened!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began</span>
<span class="s0">looking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, Miss Sonya is sure to see something,&quot; whispered Dunyasha;</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;while you do nothing but laugh.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya heard this and Natasha's whisper:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know she will. She saw something last year.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">For about three minutes all were silent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course she will!&quot; whispered Natasha, but did not finish...</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes with her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Natasha!&quot; she cried.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did you see? Did you? What was it?&quot; exclaimed Natasha, holding up</span>
<span class="s0">the looking glass.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to</span>
<span class="s0">get up when she heard Natasha say, &quot;Of course she will!&quot; She did not</span>
<span class="s0">wish to disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha, but it was hard to</span>
<span class="s0">sit still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped</span>
<span class="s0">her when she covered her eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You saw him?&quot; urged Natasha, seizing her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,&quot; Sonya could not help saying,</span>
<span class="s0">not yet knowing whom Natasha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why shouldn't I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who</span>
<span class="s0">can tell whether I saw anything or not?&quot; flashed through Sonya's mind.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I saw him,&quot; she said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How? Standing or lying?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying</span>
<span class="s0">down.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Andrew lying? Is he ill?&quot; asked Natasha, her frightened eyes</span>
<span class="s0">fixed on her friend.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he</span>
<span class="s0">turned to me.&quot; And when saying this she herself fancied she had really</span>
<span class="s0">seen what she described.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, and then, Sonya?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and</span>
<span class="s0">red...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how</span>
<span class="s0">afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...&quot; Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">began, and without replying to Sonya's words of comfort she got into</span>
<span class="s0">bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless,</span>
<span class="s0">gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his</span>
<span class="s0">love for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who</span>
<span class="s0">had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this</span>
<span class="s0">declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that</span>
<span class="s0">he might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father</span>
<span class="s0">would give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the</span>
<span class="s0">first time, felt that his mother was displeased with him and that,</span>
<span class="s0">despite her love for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without</span>
<span class="s0">looking at her son, she sent for her husband and, when he came,</span>
<span class="s0">tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts, in her son's</span>
<span class="s0">presence, but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of</span>
<span class="s0">vexation and left the room. The old count began irresolutely to</span>
<span class="s0">admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied</span>
<span class="s0">that he could not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and</span>
<span class="s0">evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the</span>
<span class="s0">countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count was always</span>
<span class="s0">conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family</span>
<span class="s0">fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry</span>
<span class="s0">an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya. On this occasion, he</span>
<span class="s0">was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had</span>
<span class="s0">not been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could</span>
<span class="s0">have been wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and</span>
<span class="s0">his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the</span>
<span class="s0">family finances.</span>

<span class="s0">The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son</span>
<span class="s0">again, but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and, with a</span>
<span class="s0">cruelty neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to</span>
<span class="s0">catch Nicholas and for ingratitude. Sonya listened silently with</span>
<span class="s0">downcast eyes to the countess' cruel words, without understanding what</span>
<span class="s0">was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her</span>
<span class="s0">benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this</span>
<span class="s0">case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She</span>
<span class="s0">could not help loving the countess and the whole Rostov family, but</span>
<span class="s0">neither could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his</span>
<span class="s0">happiness depended on that love. She was silent and sad and did not</span>
<span class="s0">reply. Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to</span>
<span class="s0">have an explanation with his mother. He first implored her to</span>
<span class="s0">forgive him and Sonya and consent to their marriage, then he</span>
<span class="s0">threatened that if she molested Sonya he would at once marry her</span>
<span class="s0">secretly.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her</span>
<span class="s0">before, replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying</span>
<span class="s0">without his father's consent, and he could do the same, but that she</span>
<span class="s0">would never receive that intriguer as her daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told</span>
<span class="s0">his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his</span>
<span class="s0">feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time....</span>
<span class="s0">But he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression</span>
<span class="s0">of his face caused his mother to await with terror, and which would</span>
<span class="s0">perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had</span>
<span class="s0">not time to say it, for Natasha, with a pale and set face, entered the</span>
<span class="s0">room from the door at which she had been listening.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I</span>
<span class="s0">tell you!...&quot; she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma darling, it's not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of a</span>
<span class="s0">rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and</span>
<span class="s0">excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nicholas, I'll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which</span>
<span class="s0">she was aiming.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter's</span>
<span class="s0">breast, while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded</span>
<span class="s0">that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sonya should not</span>
<span class="s0">be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything</span>
<span class="s0">without his parents' knowledge.</span>

<span class="s0">Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,</span>
<span class="s0">to retire from the army and return and marry Sonya, Nicholas, serious,</span>
<span class="s0">sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,</span>
<span class="s0">passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his</span>
<span class="s0">regiment.</span>

<span class="s0">After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were more</span>
<span class="s0">depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more</span>
<span class="s0">so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting</span>
<span class="s0">toward her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of</span>
<span class="s0">his affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house</span>
<span class="s0">and estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they</span>
<span class="s0">had to go to Moscow. But the countess' health obliged them to delay</span>
<span class="s0">their departure from day to day.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, who had borne the first period of separation from her</span>
<span class="s0">betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and</span>
<span class="s0">impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would</span>
<span class="s0">have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no</span>
<span class="s0">advantage to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the</span>
<span class="s0">most part irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived</span>
<span class="s0">only in the thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new</span>
<span class="s0">places and new people that interested him. The more interesting his</span>
<span class="s0">letters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from</span>
<span class="s0">giving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial</span>
<span class="s0">obligation. She could not write, because she could not conceive the</span>
<span class="s0">possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part</span>
<span class="s0">of what she expressed by voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him</span>
<span class="s0">formal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which she attached no</span>
<span class="s0">importance herself, and in the rough copies of which the countess</span>
<span class="s0">corrected her mistakes in spelling.</span>

<span class="s0">There was still no improvement in the countess' health, but it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natasha's</span>
<span class="s0">trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkonski was spending</span>
<span class="s0">the winter, and Natasha felt sure he had already arrived.</span>

<span class="s0">So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sonya</span>
<span class="s0">and Natasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.</span>




<span class="s0">BOOK EIGHT: 1811 --12</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">After Prince Andrews engagement to Natasha, Pierre without any</span>
<span class="s0">apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as</span>
<span class="s0">before. Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by</span>
<span class="s0">his benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner</span>
<span class="s0">man, to which he had devoted himself with such ardor--all the zest</span>
<span class="s0">of such a life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">the death of Joseph Alexeevich, the news of which reached him almost</span>
<span class="s0">at the same time. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important</span>
<span class="s0">personage, acquaintance with all Petersburg, and his court service</span>
<span class="s0">with its dull formalities. And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">unexpectedly loathsome. He ceased keeping a diary, avoided the company</span>
<span class="s0">of the Brothers, began going to the Club again, drank a great deal,</span>
<span class="s0">and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets, leading such a</span>
<span class="s0">life that the Countess Helene thought it necessary to speak severely</span>
<span class="s0">to him about it. Pierre felt that she right, and to avoid compromising</span>
<span class="s0">her went away to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded</span>
<span class="s0">and fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as</span>
<span class="s0">soon as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with</span>
<span class="s0">innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons,</span>
<span class="s0">the Kremlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh</span>
<span class="s0">drivers and hovels of the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old Moscovites who</span>
<span class="s0">desired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days</span>
<span class="s0">leisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls,</span>
<span class="s0">and the English Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing</span>
<span class="s0">gown.</span>

<span class="s0">Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready</span>
<span class="s0">awaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest,</span>
<span class="s0">most intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a</span>
<span class="s0">heedless, genial nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was</span>
<span class="s0">always empty because it was open to everyone.</span>

<span class="s0">Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent</span>
<span class="s0">societies, gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees,</span>
<span class="s0">Freemasons, churches, and books--no one and nothing met with a refusal</span>
<span class="s0">from him, and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large</span>
<span class="s0">sums from him and taken him under their protection, he would have</span>
<span class="s0">given everything away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the</span>
<span class="s0">Club without him. As soon as he sank into his place on the sofa</span>
<span class="s0">after two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded, and talking,</span>
<span class="s0">disputing, and joking began. When there were quarrels, his kindly</span>
<span class="s0">smile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists. The Masonic</span>
<span class="s0">dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there.</span>

<span class="s0">When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly</span>
<span class="s0">smile, yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive</span>
<span class="s0">off somewhere with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the</span>
<span class="s0">young men. At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies,</span>
<span class="s0">married and unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of</span>
<span class="s0">them, he was equally amiable to all, especially after supper. &quot;Il</span>
<span class="s0">est charmant; il n'a pas de sexe,&quot;* they said of him.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;He is charming; he has no sex.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there</span>
<span class="s0">were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">How horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first</span>
<span class="s0">arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him</span>
<span class="s0">to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally</span>
<span class="s0">predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in</span>
<span class="s0">his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one</span>
<span class="s0">time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia; then</span>
<span class="s0">himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then a</span>
<span class="s0">strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the</span>
<span class="s0">possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the</span>
<span class="s0">sinful human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of</span>
<span class="s0">perfection? Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated</span>
<span class="s0">his serfs?</span>

<span class="s0">But instead of all that--here he was, the wealthy husband of an</span>
<span class="s0">unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and</span>
<span class="s0">drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the</span>
<span class="s0">government a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal</span>
<span class="s0">favorite in Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile</span>
<span class="s0">himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">gentlemen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years before.</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only</span>
<span class="s0">living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought</span>
<span class="s0">of how many, like himself, had entered that life and that Club</span>
<span class="s0">temporarily, with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it</span>
<span class="s0">when not a single tooth or hair remained.</span>

<span class="s0">In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">him that he was quite different and distinct from those other</span>
<span class="s0">retired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were</span>
<span class="s0">empty, stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;while I am still discontented and want to do something for mankind.</span>
<span class="s0">But perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and</span>
<span class="s0">sought something new, a path in life of their own, and like me were</span>
<span class="s0">brought by force of circumstances, society, and race--by that</span>
<span class="s0">elemental force against which man is powerless--to the condition I</span>
<span class="s0">am in,&quot; said he to himself in moments of humility; and after living</span>
<span class="s0">some time in Moscow he no longer despised, but began to grow fond</span>
<span class="s0">of, to respect, and to pity his comrades in destiny, as he pitied</span>
<span class="s0">himself.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust</span>
<span class="s0">with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such</span>
<span class="s0">acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;What for? Why? What is going on in the world?&quot; he would ask himself</span>
<span class="s0">in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to</span>
<span class="s0">reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by</span>
<span class="s0">experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste</span>
<span class="s0">to turn away from them, and took up a book, or hurried of to the</span>
<span class="s0">Club or to Apollon Nikolaevich's, to exchange the gossip of the town.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Helene, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is</span>
<span class="s0">one of the stupidest women in the world,&quot; thought Pierre, &quot;is regarded</span>
<span class="s0">by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay</span>
<span class="s0">homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he</span>
<span class="s0">was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal</span>
<span class="s0">marriage. The Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise</span>
<span class="s0">to God for their victory over the French on the fourteenth of June,</span>
<span class="s0">and the French, also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because</span>
<span class="s0">on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My</span>
<span class="s0">brother Masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">everything for their neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to</span>
<span class="s0">the collections for the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge</span>
<span class="s0">against the Manna Seekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet</span>
<span class="s0">and a charter that nobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man</span>
<span class="s0">who wrote it does not understand. We all profess the Christian law</span>
<span class="s0">of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor</span>
<span class="s0">of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty churches--but</span>
<span class="s0">yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that</span>
<span class="s0">same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross</span>
<span class="s0">to kiss before his execution.&quot; So thought Pierre, and the whole of</span>
<span class="s0">this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to</span>
<span class="s0">it, astonished him each time as if it were something new. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">understand the deception and confusion,&quot; he thought, &quot;but how am I</span>
<span class="s0">to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and have always found</span>
<span class="s0">that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do,</span>
<span class="s0">and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must be so! But I-</span>
<span class="s0">what is to become of me?&quot; thought he. He had the unfortunate</span>
<span class="s0">capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and believing</span>
<span class="s0">in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil and</span>
<span class="s0">falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it.</span>
<span class="s0">Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and</span>
<span class="s0">deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil</span>
<span class="s0">and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity.</span>
<span class="s0">Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be</span>
<span class="s0">under the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned</span>
<span class="s0">himself to any distraction in order to forget them. He frequented</span>
<span class="s0">every kind of society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged in</span>
<span class="s0">building, and above all--read.</span>

<span class="s0">He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home,</span>
<span class="s0">while his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book</span>
<span class="s0">and began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping</span>
<span class="s0">to gossip in drawing rooms of the Club, from gossip to carousals and</span>
<span class="s0">women; from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking</span>
<span class="s0">became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the</span>
<span class="s0">doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for</span>
<span class="s0">him, he drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having</span>
<span class="s0">poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he</span>
<span class="s0">felt a pleasant warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his</span>
<span class="s0">fellows, and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea</span>
<span class="s0">without probing it deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did</span>
<span class="s0">he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously</span>
<span class="s0">had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always</span>
<span class="s0">conscious of some aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his</span>
<span class="s0">head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation</span>
<span class="s0">or read. But under the influence of wine he said to himself: &quot;It</span>
<span class="s0">doesn't matter. I'll get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but</span>
<span class="s0">have no time now--I'll think it all out later on!&quot; But the later on</span>
<span class="s0">never came.</span>

<span class="s0">In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions</span>
<span class="s0">appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily</span>
<span class="s0">picked up a book, and if anyone came to see him he was glad.</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when</span>
<span class="s0">entrenched under the enemy's fire, if they have nothing to do, try</span>
<span class="s0">hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:</span>
<span class="s0">some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in</span>
<span class="s0">women, some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in</span>
<span class="s0">sport, some in wine, and some in governmental affairs. &quot;Nothing is</span>
<span class="s0">trivial, and nothing is important, it's all the same--only to save</span>
<span class="s0">oneself from it as best one can,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;Only not to see it,</span>
<span class="s0">that dreadful it!&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkonski and his</span>
<span class="s0">daughter moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander's regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French</span>
<span class="s0">tendency prevailed there, and this, together with his past and his</span>
<span class="s0">intellect and his originality, at once made Prince Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski an object of particular respect to the Moscovites and the</span>
<span class="s0">center of the Moscow opposition to the government.</span>

<span class="s0">The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of</span>
<span class="s0">senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent</span>
<span class="s0">events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which</span>
<span class="s0">he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of</span>
<span class="s0">this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">respectful veneration--especially of an evening when he came in to tea</span>
<span class="s0">in his old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone,</span>
<span class="s0">told his abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and</span>
<span class="s0">scathing criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned</span>
<span class="s0">house with its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered</span>
<span class="s0">footmen, and the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past</span>
<span class="s0">century) with his gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who</span>
<span class="s0">were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable</span>
<span class="s0">spectacle. But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of</span>
<span class="s0">hours during which they saw their host, there were also twenty-two</span>
<span class="s0">hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the</span>
<span class="s0">house continued.</span>

<span class="s0">Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.</span>
<span class="s0">There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures--talks with</span>
<span class="s0">the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills--and</span>
<span class="s0">she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not</span>
<span class="s0">go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her</span>
<span class="s0">go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going</span>
<span class="s0">out himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening</span>
<span class="s0">parties. She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She</span>
<span class="s0">saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received</span>
<span class="s0">and dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">appeared at their house. She had no friends: during this visit to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to</span>
<span class="s0">her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom she had never been able to be</span>
<span class="s0">quite frank, had now become unpleasant to her, and for various reasons</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom she had corresponded for</span>
<span class="s0">the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved to be quite alien to</span>
<span class="s0">her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the death of her brothers</span>
<span class="s0">had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow, was in the full</span>
<span class="s0">whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young men who, she</span>
<span class="s0">fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at</span>
<span class="s0">that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last</span>
<span class="s0">chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or</span>
<span class="s0">never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile</span>
<span class="s0">that she now had no one to write to, since Julie--whose presence</span>
<span class="s0">gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the old</span>
<span class="s0">emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his</span>
<span class="s0">evenings for years, she regretted Julie's presence and having no one</span>
<span class="s0">to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one</span>
<span class="s0">to whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just</span>
<span class="s0">then. The time for Prince Andrew's return and marriage was</span>
<span class="s0">approaching, but his request to her to prepare his father for it had</span>
<span class="s0">not been carried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite</span>
<span class="s0">hopeless, for at every mention of the young Countess Rostova the old</span>
<span class="s0">prince (who apart from that was usually in a bad temper) lost</span>
<span class="s0">control of himself. Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons</span>
<span class="s0">she gave her six year-old nephew. To her consternation she detected in</span>
<span class="s0">herself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father's</span>
<span class="s0">irritability. However often she told herself that she must not get</span>
<span class="s0">irritable when teaching her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in</span>
<span class="s0">hand, she sat down to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to</span>
<span class="s0">pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child--who was</span>
<span class="s0">already afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry--that at</span>
<span class="s0">his slightest inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated,</span>
<span class="s0">raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in</span>
<span class="s0">the corner. Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to</span>
<span class="s0">cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following her</span>
<span class="s0">example, would sob, and without permission would leave his corner,</span>
<span class="s0">come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort her. But</span>
<span class="s0">what distressed the princess most of all was her father's</span>
<span class="s0">irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late</span>
<span class="s0">amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the</span>
<span class="s0">ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,</span>
<span class="s0">it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but</span>
<span class="s0">this loving despot--the more cruel because he loved her and for that</span>
<span class="s0">reason tormented himself and her--knew how not merely to hurt and</span>
<span class="s0">humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to</span>
<span class="s0">blame for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that</span>
<span class="s0">tormented Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his</span>
<span class="s0">ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at</span>
<span class="s0">the first moment of receiving the news of his son's intentions had</span>
<span class="s0">occurred to him in jest--that if Andrew got married he himself would</span>
<span class="s0">marry Bourienne--had evidently pleased him, and latterly he had</span>
<span class="s0">persistently, and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend</span>
<span class="s0">her, shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne.</span>

<span class="s0">One day in Moscow in Princess Mary's presence (she thought her</span>
<span class="s0">father did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her</span>
<span class="s0">affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few</span>
<span class="s0">minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary's room</span>
<span class="s0">smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary hastily wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently unconscious of what she was</span>
<span class="s0">doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice</span>
<span class="s0">breaking: &quot;It's horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the</span>
<span class="s0">weakness...&quot; She did not finish. &quot;Leave my room,&quot; she exclaimed, and</span>
<span class="s0">burst into sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she</span>
<span class="s0">noticed that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne</span>
<span class="s0">should be served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee</span>
<span class="s0">and from habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew</span>
<span class="s0">furious, threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to</span>
<span class="s0">have him conscripted for the army.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He doesn't obey... I said it twice... and he doesn't obey! She is</span>
<span class="s0">the first person in this house; she's my best friend,&quot; cried the</span>
<span class="s0">prince. &quot;And if you allow yourself,&quot; he screamed in a fury, addressing</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary for the first time, &quot;to forget yourself again before her</span>
<span class="s0">as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master in this</span>
<span class="s0">house. Go! Don't let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne's pardon, and also her</span>
<span class="s0">father's pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged</span>
<span class="s0">for her intervention.</span>

<span class="s0">At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in</span>
<span class="s0">her soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look</span>
<span class="s0">for his spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not</span>
<span class="s0">seeing them, or would forget something that had just occurred, or take</span>
<span class="s0">a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had</span>
<span class="s0">noticed his feebleness, or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no</span>
<span class="s0">visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep, letting his</span>
<span class="s0">napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate. &quot;He is old and</span>
<span class="s0">feeble, and I dare to condemn him!&quot; she thought at such moments,</span>
<span class="s0">with a feeling of revulsion against herself.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor--Metivier--who</span>
<span class="s0">had rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome,</span>
<span class="s0">amiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an</span>
<span class="s0">extraordinarily clever doctor. He was received in the best houses</span>
<span class="s0">not merely as a doctor, but as an equal.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne's advice had allowed this doctor to visit him</span>
<span class="s0">and had grown accustomed to him. Metivier came to see the prince about</span>
<span class="s0">twice a week.</span>

<span class="s0">On December 6--St. Nicholas' Day and the prince's name day--all</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow came to the prince's front door but he gave orders to admit</span>
<span class="s0">no one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom</span>
<span class="s0">he gave to Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">Metivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered</span>
<span class="s0">it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne,* as he</span>
<span class="s0">told Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on</span>
<span class="s0">that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods.</span>
<span class="s0">He had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with</span>
<span class="s0">everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not</span>
<span class="s0">to be understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet</span>
<span class="s0">absorbed querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage,</span>
<span class="s0">and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and</span>
<span class="s0">loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor's</span>
<span class="s0">arrival the morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor,</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door</span>
<span class="s0">through which she could hear all that passed in the study.</span>


<span class="s0">*To force the guard.</span>


<span class="s0">At first she heard only Metivier's voice, then her father's, then</span>
<span class="s0">both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung</span>
<span class="s0">open, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the</span>
<span class="s0">terrified Metivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his</span>
<span class="s0">dressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils</span>
<span class="s0">of his eyes rolled downwards.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You don't understand?&quot; shouted the prince, &quot;but I do! French spy,</span>
<span class="s0">slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Metivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne</span>
<span class="s0">who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head.</span>
<span class="s0">Keep calm, I will call again tomorrow,&quot; said Metivier; and putting his</span>
<span class="s0">fingers to his lips he hastened away.</span>

<span class="s0">Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment's peace in my</span>
<span class="s0">own house!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After Metivier's departure the old prince called his daughter in,</span>
<span class="s0">and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a</span>
<span class="s0">spy had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a</span>
<span class="s0">list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was</span>
<span class="s0">that scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he</span>
<span class="s0">said, he could not have a moment's peace and could not die quietly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, ma'am! We must part, we must part! Understand that,</span>
<span class="s0">understand it! I cannot endure any more,&quot; he said, and left the</span>
<span class="s0">room. Then, as if afraid she might find some means of consolation,</span>
<span class="s0">he returned and trying to appear calm added: &quot;And don't imagine I have</span>
<span class="s0">said this in a moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and</span>
<span class="s0">it will be carried out--we must part; so find some place for</span>
<span class="s0">yourself....&quot; But he could not restrain himself and with the virulence</span>
<span class="s0">of which only one who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself,</span>
<span class="s0">he shook his fists at her and screamed:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If only some fool would marry her!&quot; Then he slammed the door,</span>
<span class="s0">sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.</span>

<span class="s0">At two o'clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.</span>

<span class="s0">These guests--the famous Count Rostopchin, Prince Lopukhin with</span>
<span class="s0">his nephew, General Chatrov an old war comrade of the prince's, and of</span>
<span class="s0">the younger generation Pierre and Boris Drubetskoy--awaited the prince</span>
<span class="s0">in the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been</span>
<span class="s0">anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, and had</span>
<span class="s0">contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his</span>
<span class="s0">case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his</span>
<span class="s0">house.</span>

<span class="s0">The prince's house did not belong to what is known as fashionable</span>
<span class="s0">society, but his little circle--though not much talked about in</span>
<span class="s0">town--was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.</span>
<span class="s0">Boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in</span>
<span class="s0">his presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St. Nicholas' Day, and</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin had replied that he could not come:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas Bolkonski.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes, yes!&quot; replied the commander in chief. &quot;How is he?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty</span>
<span class="s0">old-fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn</span>
<span class="s0">gathering of a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low</span>
<span class="s0">tones. Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual. The guests were</span>
<span class="s0">reluctant to address her, feeling that she was in no mood for their</span>
<span class="s0">conversation. Count Rostopchin alone kept the conversation going,</span>
<span class="s0">now relating the latest town news, and now the latest political</span>
<span class="s0">gossip.</span>

<span class="s0">Lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the</span>
<span class="s0">conversation. Prince Bolkonski listened as a presiding judge</span>
<span class="s0">receives a report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word,</span>
<span class="s0">showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him. The</span>
<span class="s0">tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of</span>
<span class="s0">what was being done in the political world. Incidents were related</span>
<span class="s0">evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to</span>
<span class="s0">worse, but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker</span>
<span class="s0">always stopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond which his</span>
<span class="s0">criticism might touch the sovereign himself.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and the Russian Note,</span>
<span class="s0">hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times</span>
<span class="s0">before. &quot;One only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the</span>
<span class="s0">crowned heads. Now the Pope's turn has come and Bonaparte doesn't</span>
<span class="s0">scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church--yet all keep</span>
<span class="s0">silent! Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the</span>
<span class="s0">Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and even...&quot; Count Rostopchin paused,</span>
<span class="s0">feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of</span>
<span class="s0">Oldenburg,&quot; said Prince Bolkonski. &quot;He shifts the Dukes about as I</span>
<span class="s0">might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan</span>
<span class="s0">estates.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength</span>
<span class="s0">of character and resignation,&quot; remarked Boris, joining in</span>
<span class="s0">respectfully.</span>

<span class="s0">He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the</span>
<span class="s0">honor of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkonski glanced at</span>
<span class="s0">the young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his</span>
<span class="s0">mind, evidently considering him too young.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was</span>
<span class="s0">surprised how badly the Note was worded,&quot; remarked Count Rostopchin in</span>
<span class="s0">the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked at Rostopchin with naive astonishment, not</span>
<span class="s0">understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the</span>
<span class="s0">Note.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,&quot; he asked, &quot;so</span>
<span class="s0">long as its substance is forcible?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should</span>
<span class="s0">be easy to have a good style,&quot; returned Count Rostopchin.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre now understood the count's dissatisfaction with the wording</span>
<span class="s0">of the Note.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">remarked the old prince. &quot;There in Petersburg they are always writing-</span>
<span class="s0">not notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a</span>
<span class="s0">whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and he laughed unnaturally.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general</span>
<span class="s0">cleared his throat to draw attention.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The</span>
<span class="s0">figure cut by the new French ambassador.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His</span>
<span class="s0">Majesty's presence.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the</span>
<span class="s0">march past,&quot; continued the general, &quot;and it seems the ambassador</span>
<span class="s0">took no notice and allowed himself to reply that: 'We in France pay no</span>
<span class="s0">attention to such trifles!' The Emperor did not condescend to reply.</span>
<span class="s0">At the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to</span>
<span class="s0">address him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it</span>
<span class="s0">was impossible to pass any judgment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Impudent fellows!&quot; said the prince. &quot;You know Metivier? I turned</span>
<span class="s0">him out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him spite</span>
<span class="s0">of my request that they should let no one in,&quot; he went on, glancing</span>
<span class="s0">angrily at his daughter.</span>

<span class="s0">And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and</span>
<span class="s0">the reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy. Though these</span>
<span class="s0">reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.</span>

<span class="s0">After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to</span>
<span class="s0">congratulate the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.</span>

<span class="s0">He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,</span>
<span class="s0">clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told</span>
<span class="s0">her that he had not forgotten the morning's talk, that his decision</span>
<span class="s0">remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his</span>
<span class="s0">speaking of it to her now.</span>

<span class="s0">When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the</span>
<span class="s0">old men sat together.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the</span>
<span class="s0">impending war.</span>

<span class="s0">He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long</span>
<span class="s0">as we sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into</span>
<span class="s0">European affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;We ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political</span>
<span class="s0">interests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only</span>
<span class="s0">thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will</span>
<span class="s0">never dare to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can we fight the French, Prince?&quot; said Count Rostopchin. &quot;Can</span>
<span class="s0">we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our</span>
<span class="s0">youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our</span>
<span class="s0">Kingdom of Heaven.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you</span>
<span class="s0">turned Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their</span>
<span class="s0">knees. I went to a party last night, and there out of five ladies</span>
<span class="s0">three were Roman Catholics and had the Pope's indulgence for doing</span>
<span class="s0">woolwork on Sundays. And they themselves sit there nearly naked,</span>
<span class="s0">like the signboards at our Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when</span>
<span class="s0">one looks at our young people, Prince, one would like to take Peter</span>
<span class="s0">the Great's old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">All were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchin with a smile</span>
<span class="s0">and wagged his head approvingly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!&quot; said Rostopchin,</span>
<span class="s0">getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to</span>
<span class="s0">the prince.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of</span>
<span class="s0">hearing him!&quot; said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and</span>
<span class="s0">offering his cheek to be kissed.</span>

<span class="s0">Following Rostopchin's example the others also rose.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men's talk and</span>
<span class="s0">faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only</span>
<span class="s0">wondered whether the guests had all observed her father's hostile</span>
<span class="s0">attitude toward her. She did not even notice the special attentions</span>
<span class="s0">and amiabilities shown her during dinner by Boris Drubetskoy, who</span>
<span class="s0">was visiting them for the third time already.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of</span>
<span class="s0">the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and</span>
<span class="s0">they were left alone in the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May I stay a little longer?&quot; he said, letting his stout body sink</span>
<span class="s0">into an armchair beside her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;You noticed nothing?&quot; her look asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight</span>
<span class="s0">before him and smiled quietly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you known that young man long, Princess?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Drubetskoy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, not long...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you like him?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning's conversation with</span>
<span class="s0">her father.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an</span>
<span class="s0">heiress.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have observed that?&quot; said Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Pierre with a smile, &quot;and this young man now manages</span>
<span class="s0">matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. I</span>
<span class="s0">can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay</span>
<span class="s0">siege to--you or Mademoiselle Julie Karagina. He is very attentive</span>
<span class="s0">to her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He visits them?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good</span>
<span class="s0">humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his</span>
<span class="s0">diary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; replied Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is</span>
<span class="s0">very melancholy with Mademoiselle Karagina,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Really?&quot; asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre's kindly face and</span>
<span class="s0">still thinking of her own sorrow. &quot;It would be a relief,&quot; thought she,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;if I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should</span>
<span class="s0">like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would</span>
<span class="s0">be a relief. He would give me advice.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Would you marry him?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she went on in a trembling voice, &quot;that you can do nothing for him but</span>
<span class="s0">grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only</span>
<span class="s0">one thing left--to go away, but where could I go?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is wrong? What is it, Princess?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst</span>
<span class="s0">into tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know what is the matter with me today. Don't take any</span>
<span class="s0">notice--forget what I have said!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the</span>
<span class="s0">princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him;</span>
<span class="s0">but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said,</span>
<span class="s0">that she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no</span>
<span class="s0">trouble except the one he knew of--that Prince Andrew's marriage</span>
<span class="s0">threatened to cause a rupture between father and son.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you any news of the Rostovs?&quot; she asked, to change the</span>
<span class="s0">subject. &quot;I was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew any day. I should like them to meet here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how does he now regard the matter?&quot; asked Pierre, referring</span>
<span class="s0">to the old prince.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary shook her head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The</span>
<span class="s0">thing is impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first</span>
<span class="s0">moments. I wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her.</span>
<span class="s0">You have known them a long time,&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;Tell me</span>
<span class="s0">honestly the whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you</span>
<span class="s0">think of her?--The real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so</span>
<span class="s0">much doing this against his father's will that I should like to</span>
<span class="s0">know...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and</span>
<span class="s0">repeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on</span>
<span class="s0">the princess' part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that</span>
<span class="s0">he should disapprove of Andrew's choice; but in reply he said what</span>
<span class="s0">he felt rather than what he thought.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know how to answer your question,&quot; he said, blushing</span>
<span class="s0">without knowing why. &quot;I really don't know what sort of girl she is;</span>
<span class="s0">I can't analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I</span>
<span class="s0">don't know. That is all one can say about her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: &quot;Yes,</span>
<span class="s0">that's what I expected and feared.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is she clever?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre considered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think not,&quot; he said, &quot;and yet--yes. She does not deign to be</span>
<span class="s0">clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I hear they are expected very soon,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her</span>
<span class="s0">future sister-in-law as soon as the Rostovs arrived and to try to</span>
<span class="s0">accustom the old prince to her.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">Boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg,</span>
<span class="s0">so with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered</span>
<span class="s0">between the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than</span>
<span class="s0">Julie, he, without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to</span>
<span class="s0">her. When they had last met on the old prince's name day, she had</span>
<span class="s0">answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">not listening to what he was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a</span>
<span class="s0">manner peculiar to herself.</span>

<span class="s0">She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become</span>
<span class="s0">very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself</span>
<span class="s0">not merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She</span>
<span class="s0">was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a</span>
<span class="s0">very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew</span>
<span class="s0">the less dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could</span>
<span class="s0">associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and</span>
<span class="s0">the animated company that assembled at her house, without incurring</span>
<span class="s0">any obligation. A man who would have been afraid ten years before of</span>
<span class="s0">going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there,</span>
<span class="s0">for fear of compromising her and committing himself, would now go</span>
<span class="s0">boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a</span>
<span class="s0">sexless acquaintance.</span>

<span class="s0">That winter the Karagins' house was the most agreeable and</span>
<span class="s0">hospitable in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner</span>
<span class="s0">parties, a large company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day,</span>
<span class="s0">supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning. Julie never</span>
<span class="s0">missed a ball, a promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of</span>
<span class="s0">the latest fashion. But in spite of that she seemed to be</span>
<span class="s0">disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not</span>
<span class="s0">believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the joys of life,</span>
<span class="s0">and expected peace only &quot;yonder.&quot; She adopted the tone of one who</span>
<span class="s0">has suffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either lost</span>
<span class="s0">the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of</span>
<span class="s0">the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light, and had</span>
<span class="s0">even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life.</span>
<span class="s0">This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing herself, did not</span>
<span class="s0">hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time</span>
<span class="s0">pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to</span>
<span class="s0">the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused himself with</span>
<span class="s0">society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts rimes, which</span>
<span class="s0">were in vogue at the Karagins'. Only a few of these young men, among</span>
<span class="s0">them Boris, entered more deeply into Julie's melancholy, and with</span>
<span class="s0">these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of</span>
<span class="s0">all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums filled with</span>
<span class="s0">mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.</span>

<span class="s0">To Boris, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early</span>
<span class="s0">disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of</span>
<span class="s0">friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and</span>
<span class="s0">showed him her album. Boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Rustic trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:</span>

    <span class="s0">La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.</span>
    <span class="s0">Ah! contre les douleurs il n'y a pas d'autre asile.*</span>


<span class="s0">*Death gives relief and death is peaceful.</span>

 <span class="s0">Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.</span>

<span class="s0">Julia said this was charming</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">said to Boris, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a</span>
<span class="s0">book. &quot;It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness</span>
<span class="s0">and despair, showing the possibility of consolation.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In reply Boris wrote these lines:</span>

    <span class="s0">Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible,</span>
    <span class="s0">Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,</span>
    <span class="s0">Tendre melancholie, ah, viens me consoler,</span>
    <span class="s0">Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,</span>
    <span class="s0">Et mele une douceur secrete</span>
    <span class="s0">A ces pleurs que je sens couler.*</span>


<span class="s0">*Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,</span>

 <span class="s0">Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,</span>

 <span class="s0">Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,</span>

 <span class="s0">Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,</span>

 <span class="s0">And mingle a secret sweetness</span>

 <span class="s0">With these tears that I feel to be flowing.</span>


<span class="s0">For Boris, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Boris</span>
<span class="s0">read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the</span>
<span class="s0">reading because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large</span>
<span class="s0">gatherings Julie and Boris looked on one another as the only souls who</span>
<span class="s0">understood one another in a world of indifferent people.</span>

<span class="s0">Anna Mikhaylovna, who often visited the Karagins, while playing</span>
<span class="s0">cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie's dowry</span>
<span class="s0">(she was to have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests).</span>
<span class="s0">Anna Mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to</span>
<span class="s0">the wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,&quot; she said to</span>
<span class="s0">the daughter. &quot;Boris says his soul finds repose at your house. He</span>
<span class="s0">has suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,&quot; said she to</span>
<span class="s0">the mother. &quot;Ah, my dear, I can't tell you how fond I have grown of</span>
<span class="s0">Julie latterly,&quot; she said to her son. &quot;But who could help loving</span>
<span class="s0">her? She is an angelic being! Ah, Boris, Boris!&quot;--she paused. &quot;And how</span>
<span class="s0">I pity her mother,&quot; she went on; &quot;today she showed me her accounts and</span>
<span class="s0">letters from Penza (they have enormous estates there), and she, poor</span>
<span class="s0">thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother.</span>
<span class="s0">He laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had</span>
<span class="s0">to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Penza and</span>
<span class="s0">Nizhegorod estates.</span>

<span class="s0">Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy</span>
<span class="s0">adorer and was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">repulsion for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for her</span>
<span class="s0">artificiality, and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility</span>
<span class="s0">of real love still restrained Boris. His leave was expiring. He</span>
<span class="s0">spent every day and whole days at the Karagins', and every day on</span>
<span class="s0">thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow. But in Julie's presence, looking at her red face and chin</span>
<span class="s0">(nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of</span>
<span class="s0">continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural</span>
<span class="s0">rapture of married bliss, Boris could not utter the decisive words,</span>
<span class="s0">though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of</span>
<span class="s0">those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of</span>
<span class="s0">the income from them. Julie saw Boris' indecision, and sometimes the</span>
<span class="s0">thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him, but her</span>
<span class="s0">feminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation, and</span>
<span class="s0">she told herself that he was only shy from love. Her melancholy,</span>
<span class="s0">however, began to turn to irritability, and not long before Boris'</span>
<span class="s0">departure she formed a definite plan of action. Just as Boris' leave</span>
<span class="s0">of absence was expiring, Anatole Kuragin made his appearance in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and of course in the Karagins' drawing room, and Julie,</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and very attentive</span>
<span class="s0">to Kuragin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son, &quot;I know from a reliable</span>
<span class="s0">source that Prince Vasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him</span>
<span class="s0">married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for</span>
<span class="s0">her. What do you think of it, my dear?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that</span>
<span class="s0">whole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing</span>
<span class="s0">all the revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally</span>
<span class="s0">apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another,</span>
<span class="s0">and especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Boris.</span>
<span class="s0">He drove to the Karagins' with the firm intention of proposing.</span>
<span class="s0">Julie met him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had</span>
<span class="s0">enjoyed yesterday's ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though</span>
<span class="s0">Boris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">meant to be tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine</span>
<span class="s0">inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how</span>
<span class="s0">their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them.</span>
<span class="s0">Julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs</span>
<span class="s0">variety, and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then I should advise you...&quot; Boris began, wishing to sting her; but</span>
<span class="s0">at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have</span>
<span class="s0">to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly</span>
<span class="s0">wasted his efforts--which was a thing he never allowed to happen.</span>

<span class="s0">He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes</span>
<span class="s0">to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and</span>
<span class="s0">said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability</span>
<span class="s0">had suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were</span>
<span class="s0">fixed on him with greedy expectation. &quot;I can always arrange so as</span>
<span class="s0">not to see her often,&quot; thought Boris. &quot;The affair has been begun and</span>
<span class="s0">must be finished!&quot; He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and</span>
<span class="s0">said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know my feelings for you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">There was no need to say more: Julie's face shone with triumph and</span>
<span class="s0">self-satisfaction; but she forced Boris to say all that is said on</span>
<span class="s0">such occasions--that he loved her and had never loved any other</span>
<span class="s0">woman more than her. She knew that for the Penza estates and</span>
<span class="s0">Nizhegorod forests she could demand this, and she received what she</span>
<span class="s0">demanded.</span>

<span class="s0">The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom</span>
<span class="s0">and melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house</span>
<span class="s0">in Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant</span>
<span class="s0">wedding.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">At the end of January old Count Rostov went to Moscow with Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">and Sonya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it</span>
<span class="s0">was impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his</span>
<span class="s0">future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkonski while he was in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow could not be missed. The Rostovs' Moscow house had not been</span>
<span class="s0">heated that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the</span>
<span class="s0">countess was not with them, the count decided to stay with Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had long been pressing her hospitality</span>
<span class="s0">on them.</span>

<span class="s0">Late one evening the Rostovs' four sleighs drove into Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna's courtyard in the old Konyusheny street. Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter,</span>
<span class="s0">and her sons were all in the service.</span>

<span class="s0">She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,</span>
<span class="s0">loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach</span>
<span class="s0">to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation--the possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing</span>
<span class="s0">jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:</span>
<span class="s0">on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on</span>
<span class="s0">affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after</span>
<span class="s0">dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there</span>
<span class="s0">were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing</span>
<span class="s0">meal at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she</span>
<span class="s0">played a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a</span>
<span class="s0">new book read to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception</span>
<span class="s0">and went out to pay visits, and then only to the most important</span>
<span class="s0">persons in the town.</span>

<span class="s0">She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the</span>
<span class="s0">pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs and their servants. Marya Dmitrievna, with her spectacles</span>
<span class="s0">hanging down on her nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall</span>
<span class="s0">doorway looking with a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might</span>
<span class="s0">have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately</span>
<span class="s0">turn them out, had she not at the same time been giving careful</span>
<span class="s0">instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and</span>
<span class="s0">their belongings.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The count's things? Bring them here,&quot; she said, pointing to the</span>
<span class="s0">portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. &quot;The young ladies'? There to the</span>
<span class="s0">left. Now what are you dawdling for?&quot; she cried to the maids. &quot;Get the</span>
<span class="s0">samovar ready!... You've grown plumper and prettier,&quot; she remarked,</span>
<span class="s0">drawing Natasha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by</span>
<span class="s0">the hood. &quot;Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand. &quot;You're half</span>
<span class="s0">frozen, I'm sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sonya dear!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">added, turning to Sonya and indicating by this French greeting her</span>
<span class="s0">slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.</span>

<span class="s0">When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things</span>
<span class="s0">and tidied themselves up after their journey, Marya Dmitrievna</span>
<span class="s0">kissed them all in due order.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was</span>
<span class="s0">high time,&quot; she said, giving Natasha a significant look. &quot;The old</span>
<span class="s0">man is here and his son's expected any day. You'll have to make his</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintance. But we'll speak of that later on,&quot; she added, glancing at</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her</span>
<span class="s0">presence. &quot;Now listen,&quot; she said to the count. &quot;What do you want</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshin?&quot; she crooked one of her</span>
<span class="s0">fingers. &quot;The sniveling Anna Mikhaylovna? That's two. She's here</span>
<span class="s0">with her son. The son is getting married! Then Bezukhov, eh? He is</span>
<span class="s0">here too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping</span>
<span class="s0">after him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them&quot;--and she</span>
<span class="s0">pointed to the girls--&quot;tomorrow I'll take them first to the Iberian</span>
<span class="s0">shrine of the Mother of God, and then we'll drive to the</span>
<span class="s0">Super-Rogue's. I suppose you'll have everything new. Don't judge by</span>
<span class="s0">me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Irina</span>
<span class="s0">Vasilevna came to see me; she was an awful sight--looked as if she had</span>
<span class="s0">put two barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without</span>
<span class="s0">some new fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?&quot; she asked</span>
<span class="s0">the count sternly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a</span>
<span class="s0">purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If</span>
<span class="s0">you will be so kind, I'll fix a time and go down to the estate just</span>
<span class="s0">for a day, and leave my lassies with you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right. All right. They'll be safe with me, as safe as in</span>
<span class="s0">Chancery! I'll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet</span>
<span class="s0">them a bit,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna, touching her goddaughter and</span>
<span class="s0">favorite, Natasha, on the cheek with her large hand.</span>

<span class="s0">Next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian</span>
<span class="s0">shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so</span>
<span class="s0">afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at</span>
<span class="s0">a loss merely to get rid of her. Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the</span>
<span class="s0">whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the</span>
<span class="s0">room except Nataisha, and then called her pet to her armchair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, now we'll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.</span>
<span class="s0">You've hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I've known</span>
<span class="s0">him since he was so high.&quot; She held her hand a couple of feet from the</span>
<span class="s0">ground. Natasha blushed happily. &quot;I like him and all his family. Now</span>
<span class="s0">listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son's</span>
<span class="s0">marrying. The old fellow's crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a</span>
<span class="s0">child and can shift without him, but it's not nice to enter a family</span>
<span class="s0">against a father's will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.</span>
<span class="s0">You're a clever girl and you'll know how to manage. Be kind, and use</span>
<span class="s0">your wits. Then all will be well.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha remained silent, from shyness Marya Dmitrievna supposed, but</span>
<span class="s0">really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her</span>
<span class="s0">love of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human</span>
<span class="s0">affairs that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew, he loved her only, and was to come one of these days and</span>
<span class="s0">take her. She wanted nothing more.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your</span>
<span class="s0">future sister-in-law. 'Husbands' sisters bring up blisters,' but</span>
<span class="s0">this one wouldn't hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two</span>
<span class="s0">together. Tomorrow you'll go with your father to see her. Be very nice</span>
<span class="s0">and affectionate to her: you're younger than she. When he comes, he'll</span>
<span class="s0">find you already know his sister and father and are liked by them.</span>
<span class="s0">Am I right or not? Won't that be best?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it will,&quot; Natasha answered reluctantly.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">Next day, by Marya Dmitrievna's advice, Count Rostov took Natasha to</span>
<span class="s0">call on Prince Nicholas Bolkonski. The count did not set out</span>
<span class="s0">cheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well</span>
<span class="s0">remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the</span>
<span class="s0">time of the enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he</span>
<span class="s0">had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his</span>
<span class="s0">full quota of men. Natasha, on the other hand, having put on her</span>
<span class="s0">best gown, was in the highest spirits. &quot;They can't help liking me,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she thought. &quot;Everybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do</span>
<span class="s0">anything they wish, so ready to be fond of him--for being his</span>
<span class="s0">father--and of her--for being his sister--that there is no reason</span>
<span class="s0">for them not to like me...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvizhenka and</span>
<span class="s0">entered the vestibule.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, the Lord have mercy on us!&quot; said the count, half in jest,</span>
<span class="s0">half in earnest; but Natasha noticed that her father was flurried on</span>
<span class="s0">entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the</span>
<span class="s0">prince and princess were at home.</span>

<span class="s0">When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the</span>
<span class="s0">servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by</span>
<span class="s0">another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a</span>
<span class="s0">maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning</span>
<span class="s0">the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced</span>
<span class="s0">to the Rostovs that the prince was not receiving, but that the</span>
<span class="s0">princess begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the</span>
<span class="s0">visitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and</span>
<span class="s0">daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess'</span>
<span class="s0">room. The princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in</span>
<span class="s0">patches, ran in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly</span>
<span class="s0">trying to appear cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary did not like Natasha. She thought her too fashionably dressed,</span>
<span class="s0">frivolously gay and vain. She did not at all realize that before</span>
<span class="s0">having seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by</span>
<span class="s0">involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by</span>
<span class="s0">jealousy of her brother's love for her. Apart from this insuperable</span>
<span class="s0">antipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated just then because on</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs' being announced, the old prince had shouted that he did</span>
<span class="s0">not wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but</span>
<span class="s0">they were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive</span>
<span class="s0">them, but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some</span>
<span class="s0">freak, as he seemed much upset by the Rostovs' visit.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, my dear princess, I've brought you my songstress,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old</span>
<span class="s0">prince might appear. &quot;I am so glad you should get to know one</span>
<span class="s0">another... very sorry the prince is still ailing,&quot; and after a few</span>
<span class="s0">more commonplace remarks he rose. &quot;If you'll allow me to leave my</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I'll drive</span>
<span class="s0">round to see Anna Semenovna, it's quite near in the Dogs' Square,</span>
<span class="s0">and then I'll come back for her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told</span>
<span class="s0">his daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk</span>
<span class="s0">to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of</span>
<span class="s0">encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention</span>
<span class="s0">this to his daughter, but Natasha noticed her father's nervousness and</span>
<span class="s0">anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still</span>
<span class="s0">angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold</span>
<span class="s0">and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of</span>
<span class="s0">anybody. The princess told the count that she would be delighted,</span>
<span class="s0">and only begged him to stay longer at Anna Semenovna's, and he</span>
<span class="s0">departed.</span>

<span class="s0">Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary--who</span>
<span class="s0">wished to have a tete-a-tete with Natasha--Mademoiselle Bourienne</span>
<span class="s0">remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements</span>
<span class="s0">and theaters. Natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had</span>
<span class="s0">noticed in the anteroom, by her father's nervousness, and by the</span>
<span class="s0">unnatural manner of the princess who--she thought--was making a</span>
<span class="s0">favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her. She did</span>
<span class="s0">not like Princess Mary, whom she thought very plain, affected, and</span>
<span class="s0">dry. Natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an</span>
<span class="s0">offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still more. After five</span>
<span class="s0">minutes of irksome, constrained conversation, they heard the sound</span>
<span class="s0">of slippered feet rapidly approaching. Princess Mary looked</span>
<span class="s0">frightened.</span>

<span class="s0">The door opened and the old prince, in a dress, ing gown and a white</span>
<span class="s0">nightcap, came in.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, madam!&quot; he began. &quot;Madam, Countess... Countess Rostova, if I am</span>
<span class="s0">not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not</span>
<span class="s0">know, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with</span>
<span class="s0">a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg</span>
<span class="s0">you to excuse me... God is my witness, I didn't know-&quot; he repeated,</span>
<span class="s0">stressing the word &quot;God&quot; so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at</span>
<span class="s0">her father or at Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not</span>
<span class="s0">know,&quot; muttered the old man, and after looking Natasha over from</span>
<span class="s0">head to foot he went out.</span>

<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this</span>
<span class="s0">apparition and began speaking about the prince's indisposition.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the</span>
<span class="s0">longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater</span>
<span class="s0">grew their antipathy to one another.</span>

<span class="s0">When the count returned, Natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened</span>
<span class="s0">to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who</span>
<span class="s0">could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an</span>
<span class="s0">hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. &quot;I couldn't begin</span>
<span class="s0">talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary.</span>
<span class="s0">She knew what she ought to have said to Natasha, but she had been</span>
<span class="s0">unable to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and</span>
<span class="s0">because, without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of</span>
<span class="s0">the marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary went up hurriedly to Natasha, took her by the hand, and said with</span>
<span class="s0">a deep sigh:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wait, I must...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear Natalie,&quot; said Princess Mary, &quot;I want you to know that I am</span>
<span class="s0">glad my brother has found happiness....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">noticed this and guessed its reason.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears</span>
<span class="s0">choking her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What have I said and what have I done?&quot; thought she, as soon as she</span>
<span class="s0">was out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">They waited a long time for Natasha to come to dinner that day.</span>
<span class="s0">She sat in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing.</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya stood beside her, kissing her hair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, what is it about?&quot; she asked. &quot;What do they matter to you?</span>
<span class="s0">It will all pass, Natasha.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't talk about it, Natasha. It wasn't your fault so why should</span>
<span class="s0">you mind? Kiss me,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed</span>
<span class="s0">her wet face against her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I can't tell you, I don't know. No one's to blame,&quot; said Natasha-</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;It's my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn't he</span>
<span class="s0">come?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She came in to dinner with red eyes. Marya Dmitrievna, who knew</span>
<span class="s0">how the prince had received the Rostovs, pretended not to notice how</span>
<span class="s0">upset Natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the</span>
<span class="s0">count and the other guests.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">That evening the Rostovs went to the Opera, for which Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna had taken a box.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha did not want to go, but could not refuse Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna's kind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she</span>
<span class="s0">came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and</span>
<span class="s0">looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty, very</span>
<span class="s0">pretty, she felt even more sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but</span>
<span class="s0">differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply</span>
<span class="s0">embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those</span>
<span class="s0">searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me,</span>
<span class="s0">and then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes--how</span>
<span class="s0">I see those eyes!&quot; thought Natasha. &quot;And what do his father and sister</span>
<span class="s0">matter to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, with his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not</span>
<span class="s0">think of him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for</span>
<span class="s0">the present. I can't bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and she turned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And how can Sonya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so</span>
<span class="s0">long and so patiently?&quot; thought she, looking at Sonya, who also came</span>
<span class="s0">in quite ready, with a fan in her hand. &quot;No, she's altogether</span>
<span class="s0">different. I can't!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not</span>
<span class="s0">enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at</span>
<span class="s0">once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words</span>
<span class="s0">of love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside</span>
<span class="s0">her father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps</span>
<span class="s0">flickering on the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in</span>
<span class="s0">love, and forgot where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into</span>
<span class="s0">the line of carriages, the Rostovs' carriage drove up to the</span>
<span class="s0">theater, its wheels squeaking over the snow. Natasha and Sonya,</span>
<span class="s0">holding up their dresses, jumped out quickly. The count got out helped</span>
<span class="s0">by the footmen, and, passing among men and women who were entering and</span>
<span class="s0">the program sellers, they all three went along the corridor to the</span>
<span class="s0">first row of boxes. Through the closed doors the music was already</span>
<span class="s0">audible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, your hair!...&quot; whispered Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and</span>
<span class="s0">opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the</span>
<span class="s0">door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered</span>
<span class="s0">before their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of</span>
<span class="s0">feminine envy at Natasha. The curtain had not yet risen and the</span>
<span class="s0">overture was being played. Natasha, smoothing her gown, went in with</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya and sat down, scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite.</span>
<span class="s0">A sensation she had not experienced for a long time--that of</span>
<span class="s0">hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck--suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole</span>
<span class="s0">crowd of memories, desires and emotions associated with that feeling.</span>

<span class="s0">The two remarkably pretty girls, Natasha and Sonya, with Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted</span>
<span class="s0">general attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natasha's</span>
<span class="s0">engagement to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostovs had lived in</span>
<span class="s0">the country ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who</span>
<span class="s0">was making one of the best matches in Russia.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha's looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the</span>
<span class="s0">country, and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly</span>
<span class="s0">pretty. She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and</span>
<span class="s0">beauty, combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her</span>
<span class="s0">black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her</span>
<span class="s0">delicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the</span>
<span class="s0">box, while, evidently unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in</span>
<span class="s0">time to the music, crumpling her program. &quot;Look, there's Alenina,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Sonya, &quot;with her mother, isn't it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!&quot; remarked</span>
<span class="s0">the count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look at our Anna Mikhaylovna--what a headdress she has on!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Karagins, Julie--and Boris with them. One can see at once</span>
<span class="s0">that they're engaged....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Drubetskoy has proposed?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, I heard it today,&quot; said Shinshin, coming into the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs' box.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked in the direction in which her father's eyes were</span>
<span class="s0">turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on</span>
<span class="s0">her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck--which</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and</span>
<span class="s0">leaning over with an ear to Julie's mouth, was Boris' handsome</span>
<span class="s0">smoothly brushed head. He looked the Rostovs from under his brows</span>
<span class="s0">and said something, smiling, to his betrothed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They are talking about us, about me and him!&quot; thought Natasha. &quot;And</span>
<span class="s0">he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn't trouble</span>
<span class="s0">themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of</span>
<span class="s0">them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Behind them sat Anna Mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and</span>
<span class="s0">with a happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their</span>
<span class="s0">box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha knew so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">remembered all that had been so humiliating in her morning's visit.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,</span>
<span class="s0">better not think of it--not till he comes back!&quot; she told herself, and</span>
<span class="s0">began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the</span>
<span class="s0">stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against the</span>
<span class="s0">orchestra rail, stood Dolokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair</span>
<span class="s0">brushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,</span>
<span class="s0">well aware that he was attracting everyone's attention, yet as much at</span>
<span class="s0">ease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow's</span>
<span class="s0">most brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.</span>

<span class="s0">The count, laughing, nudged the blushing Sonya and pointed to her</span>
<span class="s0">former adorer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you recognize him?&quot; said he. &quot;And where has he sprung from?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he asked, turning to Shinshin. &quot;Didn't he vanish somewhere?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He did,&quot; replied Shinshin. &quot;He was in the Caucasus and ran away</span>
<span class="s0">from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling</span>
<span class="s0">prince in Persia, where he killed the Shah's brother. Now all the</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow ladies are mad about him! It's 'Dolokhov the Persian' that does</span>
<span class="s0">it! We never hear a word but Dolokhov is mentioned. They swear by him,</span>
<span class="s0">they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet. Dolokhov</span>
<span class="s0">and Anatole Kuragin have turned all our ladies' heads.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed</span>
<span class="s0">plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string</span>
<span class="s0">of large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk</span>
<span class="s0">dress and took a long time settling into her place.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and</span>
<span class="s0">pearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the</span>
<span class="s0">pearls. While Natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time</span>
<span class="s0">the lady looked round and, meeting the count's eyes, nodded to him and</span>
<span class="s0">smiled. She was the Countess Bezukhova, Pierre's wife, and the</span>
<span class="s0">count, who knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you been here long, Countess?&quot; he inquired. &quot;I'll call, I'll</span>
<span class="s0">call to kiss your hand. I'm here on business and have brought my girls</span>
<span class="s0">with me. They say Semenova acts marvelously. Count Pierre never used</span>
<span class="s0">to forget us. Is he here?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he meant to look in,&quot; answered Helene, and glanced attentively</span>
<span class="s0">at Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostov resumed his seat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Handsome, isn't she?&quot; he whispered to Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wonderful!&quot; answered Natasha. &quot;She's a woman one could easily</span>
<span class="s0">fall in love with.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the</span>
<span class="s0">conductor tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in</span>
<span class="s0">the stalls, and the curtain rose.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent,</span>
<span class="s0">and all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and</span>
<span class="s0">all the women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole</span>
<span class="s0">attention with eager curiosity to the stage. Natasha too began to look</span>
<span class="s0">at it.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides</span>
<span class="s0">was some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a</span>
<span class="s0">cloth stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls</span>
<span class="s0">in red bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk</span>
<span class="s0">dress sat apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of</span>
<span class="s0">green cardboard was glued. They all sang something. When they had</span>
<span class="s0">finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter's box</span>
<span class="s0">and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding</span>
<span class="s0">a plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing, waving his</span>
<span class="s0">arms about.</span>

<span class="s0">First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang,</span>
<span class="s0">then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man</span>
<span class="s0">fingered the hand of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to</span>
<span class="s0">start singing with her. They sang together and everyone in the theater</span>
<span class="s0">began clapping and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage--who</span>
<span class="s0">represented lovers--began smiling, spreading out their arms, and</span>
<span class="s0">bowing.</span>

<span class="s0">After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood,</span>
<span class="s0">all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha. She could not follow</span>
<span class="s0">the opera nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted</span>
<span class="s0">cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke,</span>
<span class="s0">and sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it was</span>
<span class="s0">all meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously false and</span>
<span class="s0">unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused</span>
<span class="s0">at them. She looked at the faces of the audience, seeking in them</span>
<span class="s0">the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced, but</span>
<span class="s0">they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage, and</span>
<span class="s0">expressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned. &quot;I suppose it has</span>
<span class="s0">to be like this!&quot; she thought. She kept looking round in turn at the</span>
<span class="s0">rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women</span>
<span class="s0">in the boxes, especially at Helene in the next box, who--apparently</span>
<span class="s0">quite unclothed--sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded the</span>
<span class="s0">whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little by</span>
<span class="s0">little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not</span>
<span class="s0">experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she</span>
<span class="s0">was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought,</span>
<span class="s0">the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through</span>
<span class="s0">her mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box</span>
<span class="s0">and singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to</span>
<span class="s0">touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then</span>
<span class="s0">to lean over to Helene and tickle her.</span>

<span class="s0">At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song,</span>
<span class="s0">a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostovs' box</span>
<span class="s0">creaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. &quot;There's</span>
<span class="s0">Kuragin!&quot; whispered Shinshin. Countess Bezukhova turned smiling to the</span>
<span class="s0">newcomer, and Natasha, following the direction of that look, saw an</span>
<span class="s0">exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a</span>
<span class="s0">self-assured yet courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kuragin whom</span>
<span class="s0">she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was</span>
<span class="s0">now in an adjutant's uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot.</span>
<span class="s0">He moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous</span>
<span class="s0">had he not been so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn</span>
<span class="s0">such an expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though</span>
<span class="s0">the performance was proceeding, he walked deliberately down the</span>
<span class="s0">carpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his</span>
<span class="s0">handsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at Natasha he</span>
<span class="s0">approached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her</span>
<span class="s0">box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a</span>
<span class="s0">motion toward Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mais charmante!&quot; said he, evidently referring to Natasha, who did</span>
<span class="s0">not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of</span>
<span class="s0">his lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and</span>
<span class="s0">sat down beside Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and</span>
<span class="s0">offhand way that Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He</span>
<span class="s0">winked at him gaily, smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra</span>
<span class="s0">screen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How like the brother is to the sister,&quot; remarked the count. &quot;And</span>
<span class="s0">how handsome they both are!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Shinshin, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some</span>
<span class="s0">intrigue of Kuragin's in Moscow, and Natasha tried to overhear it just</span>
<span class="s0">because he had said she was &quot;charmante.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about,</span>
<span class="s0">going out and coming in.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris came to the Rostovs' box, received their congratulations</span>
<span class="s0">very simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile</span>
<span class="s0">conveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fiancee's invitation to her wedding,</span>
<span class="s0">and went away. Natasha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and</span>
<span class="s0">congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Boris with whom she</span>
<span class="s0">had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,</span>
<span class="s0">everything seemed simple and natural.</span>

<span class="s0">The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way, and</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha gave Boris a similar smile.</span>

<span class="s0">Helene's box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most</span>
<span class="s0">distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another</span>
<span class="s0">in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.</span>

<span class="s0">During the whole of that entr'acte Kuragin stood with Dolokhov in</span>
<span class="s0">front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostovs' box. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even</span>
<span class="s0">turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its</span>
<span class="s0">most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">appeared in the stalls. The Rostovs had not seen him since their</span>
<span class="s0">arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing</span>
<span class="s0">anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at</span>
<span class="s0">and indicating the Rostovs' box. On seeing Natasha Pierre grew</span>
<span class="s0">animated and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box.</span>
<span class="s0">When he got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to</span>
<span class="s0">her for a long time. While conversing with Pierre, Natasha heard a</span>
<span class="s0">man's voice in Countess Bezukhova's box and something told her it</span>
<span class="s0">was Kuragin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed</span>
<span class="s0">straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that</span>
<span class="s0">it seemed strange to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be</span>
<span class="s0">so sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.</span>

<span class="s0">In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there</span>
<span class="s0">was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were</span>
<span class="s0">raised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep</span>
<span class="s0">notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black</span>
<span class="s0">cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands. They began</span>
<span class="s0">waving their arms. Then some other people ran in and began dragging</span>
<span class="s0">away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue.</span>
<span class="s0">They did not drag her away at once, but sang with her for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time and then at last dragged her off, and behind the scenes something</span>
<span class="s0">metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a</span>
<span class="s0">prayer. All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiastic shouts of the audience.</span>

<span class="s0">During this act every time Natasha looked toward the stalls she</span>
<span class="s0">saw Anatole Kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,</span>
<span class="s0">staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her</span>
<span class="s0">and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.</span>

<span class="s0">When the second act was over Countess Bezukhova rose, turned to</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs' box--her whole bosom completely exposed--beckoned the old</span>
<span class="s0">count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had</span>
<span class="s0">entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters,&quot; said she. &quot;The</span>
<span class="s0">whole town is singing their praises and I don't even know then!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so</span>
<span class="s0">pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I want to become a Moscovite too, now,&quot; said Helene. &quot;How is it</span>
<span class="s0">you're not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Countess Bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a</span>
<span class="s0">fascinating woman. She could say what she did not think--especially</span>
<span class="s0">what was flattering--quite simply and naturally.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I</span>
<span class="s0">am not staying here long this time--nor are you--I will try to amuse</span>
<span class="s0">them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get</span>
<span class="s0">to know you,&quot; said she to Natasha with her stereotyped and lovely</span>
<span class="s0">smile. &quot;I had heard about you from my page, Drubetskoy. Have you heard</span>
<span class="s0">he is getting married? And also from my husband's friend Bolkonski,</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew Bolkonski,&quot; she went on with special emphasis,</span>
<span class="s0">implying that she knew of his relation to Natasha. To get better</span>
<span class="s0">acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her</span>
<span class="s0">box for the rest of the performance, and Natasha moved over to it.</span>

<span class="s0">The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many</span>
<span class="s0">candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on</span>
<span class="s0">the walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a</span>
<span class="s0">queen. The king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang</span>
<span class="s0">something badly and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had</span>
<span class="s0">been first in white and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and</span>
<span class="s0">stood beside the throne with her hair down. She sang something</span>
<span class="s0">mournfully, addressing the queen, but the king waved his arm severely,</span>
<span class="s0">and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began</span>
<span class="s0">dancing all together. Then the violins played very shrilly and merrily</span>
<span class="s0">and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms, separating</span>
<span class="s0">from the others, went behind the wings, adjusted her bodice,</span>
<span class="s0">returned to the middle of the stage, and began jumping and striking</span>
<span class="s0">one foot rapidly against the other. In the stalls everyone clapped and</span>
<span class="s0">shouted &quot;bravo!&quot; Then one of the men went into a corner of the</span>
<span class="s0">stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly,</span>
<span class="s0">and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet</span>
<span class="s0">about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty thousand rubles</span>
<span class="s0">a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes, and galleries</span>
<span class="s0">began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the man</span>
<span class="s0">stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men</span>
<span class="s0">and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the</span>
<span class="s0">sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm</span>
<span class="s0">came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the</span>
<span class="s0">orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number</span>
<span class="s0">away, and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise</span>
<span class="s0">and clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone</span>
<span class="s0">began shouting: &quot;Duport! Duport! Duport!&quot; Natasha no longer thought</span>
<span class="s0">this strange. She look about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Isn't Duport delightful?&quot; Helene asked her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; replied Natasha.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">During the entr'acte a whiff of cold air came into Helene's box, the</span>
<span class="s0">door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush</span>
<span class="s0">against anyone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let me introduce my brother to you,&quot; said Helene, her eyes shifting</span>
<span class="s0">uneasily from Natasha to Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young</span>
<span class="s0">officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was</span>
<span class="s0">as handsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her</span>
<span class="s0">and told her he had long wished to have this happiness--ever since the</span>
<span class="s0">Naryshkins' ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure of seeing her. Kuragin was much more sensible and simple with</span>
<span class="s0">women than among men. He talked boldly and naturally, and Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was</span>
<span class="s0">nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk,</span>
<span class="s0">but that on the contrary his smile was most naive, cheerful, and</span>
<span class="s0">good-natured.</span>

<span class="s0">Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a</span>
<span class="s0">previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And do you know, Countess,&quot; he said, suddenly addressing her as</span>
<span class="s0">an old, familiar acquaintance, &quot;we are getting up a costume</span>
<span class="s0">tournament; you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We</span>
<span class="s0">shall all meet at the Karagins'! Please come! No! Really, eh?&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">he.</span>

<span class="s0">While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,</span>
<span class="s0">her neck, and her bare arms. Natasha knew for certain that he was</span>
<span class="s0">enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel</span>
<span class="s0">constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt</span>
<span class="s0">that he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his</span>
<span class="s0">eye so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking</span>
<span class="s0">into his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that</span>
<span class="s0">barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other</span>
<span class="s0">men. She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come</span>
<span class="s0">to feel herself terribly near to this man. When she turned away she</span>
<span class="s0">feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her</span>
<span class="s0">on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that</span>
<span class="s0">they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha kept turning to Helene and to her father, as if asking what it</span>
<span class="s0">all meant, but Helene was engaged in conversation with a general and</span>
<span class="s0">did not answer her look, and her father's eyes said nothing but what</span>
<span class="s0">they always said: &quot;Having a good time? Well, I'm glad of it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole's</span>
<span class="s0">prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natasha, to</span>
<span class="s0">break the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the</span>
<span class="s0">question and blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she</span>
<span class="s0">was doing something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage</span>
<span class="s0">her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant</span>
<span class="s0">ce sont les jolies femmes,* isn't that so? But now I like it very much</span>
<span class="s0">indeed,&quot; he said, looking at her significantly. &quot;You'll come to the</span>
<span class="s0">costume tournament, Countess? Do come!&quot; and putting out his hand to</span>
<span class="s0">her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, &quot;You will be the</span>
<span class="s0">prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as</span>
<span class="s0">a pledge!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">*Are the pretty women.</span>


<span class="s0">Natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did</span>
<span class="s0">himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an</span>
<span class="s0">improper intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if</span>
<span class="s0">she had not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she</span>
<span class="s0">felt that he was there, behind, so close behind her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?&quot; she asked</span>
<span class="s0">herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked</span>
<span class="s0">straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the</span>
<span class="s0">good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just</span>
<span class="s0">as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt</span>
<span class="s0">with horror that no barrier lay between him and her.</span>

<span class="s0">The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive</span>
<span class="s0">to the world she found herself in. All that was going on before her</span>
<span class="s0">now seemed quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country</span>
<span class="s0">did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote</span>
<span class="s0">past.</span>

<span class="s0">In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his</span>
<span class="s0">arm about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he</span>
<span class="s0">disappeared down below. That was the only part of the fourth act</span>
<span class="s0">that Natasha saw. She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of</span>
<span class="s0">this was Kuragin whom she could not help watching. As they were</span>
<span class="s0">leaving the theater Anatole came up to them, called their carriage,</span>
<span class="s0">and helped them in. As he was putting Natasha in he pressed her arm</span>
<span class="s0">above the elbow. Agitated and flushed she turned round. He was looking</span>
<span class="s0">at her with glittering eyes, smiling tenderly.</span>


<span class="s0">Only after she had reached home was Natasha able clearly to think</span>
<span class="s0">over what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew she was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after</span>
<span class="s0">the opera, she gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the</span>
<span class="s0">room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O God! I am lost!&quot; she said to herself. &quot;How could I let him?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to</span>
<span class="s0">realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to</span>
<span class="s0">understand what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark,</span>
<span class="s0">obscure, and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater</span>
<span class="s0">where the bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped</span>
<span class="s0">about to the music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the</span>
<span class="s0">nearly naked Helene with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;bravo!&quot;--there in the presence of that Helene it had all seemed clear</span>
<span class="s0">and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;What is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this</span>
<span class="s0">gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?&quot; she thought.</span>

<span class="s0">Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have told all</span>
<span class="s0">she was feeling. She knew that Sonya with her severe and simple</span>
<span class="s0">views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at</span>
<span class="s0">such a confession. So Natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by</span>
<span class="s0">herself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Am I spoiled for Andrew's love or not?&quot; she asked herself, and with</span>
<span class="s0">soothing irony replied: &quot;What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen</span>
<span class="s0">to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn't lead him on at all.</span>
<span class="s0">Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,&quot; she told herself.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;So it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to</span>
<span class="s0">repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why 'still?' O God, why</span>
<span class="s0">isn't he here?&quot; Natasha quieted herself for a moment, but again some</span>
<span class="s0">instinct told her that though all this was true, and though nothing</span>
<span class="s0">had happened, yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">had perished. And again in imagination she went over her whole</span>
<span class="s0">conversation with Kuragin, and again saw the face, gestures, and</span>
<span class="s0">tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole Kuragin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent</span>
<span class="s0">him away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand</span>
<span class="s0">rubles a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more,</span>
<span class="s0">which his creditors demanded from his father.</span>

<span class="s0">His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for</span>
<span class="s0">the last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as</span>
<span class="s0">adjutant to the commander in chief--a post his father had procured for</span>
<span class="s0">him--and would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to</span>
<span class="s0">him Princess Mary and Julie Karagina.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him</span>
<span class="s0">after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and</span>
<span class="s0">gave him money under the guise of loans.</span>

<span class="s0">As Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had</span>
<span class="s0">turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that</span>
<span class="s0">he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French</span>
<span class="s0">actresses--with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to</span>
<span class="s0">be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at</span>
<span class="s0">Danilov's or other Moscow revelers', drank whole nights through,</span>
<span class="s0">outvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the</span>
<span class="s0">best society. There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies,</span>
<span class="s0">and he flirted with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run</span>
<span class="s0">after the unmarried girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most</span>
<span class="s0">of them plain. There was a special reason for this, as he had got</span>
<span class="s0">married two years before--a fact known only to his most intimate</span>
<span class="s0">friends. At that time while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish</span>
<span class="s0">landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole</span>
<span class="s0">had very soon abandoned his wife and, for a payment which he agreed to</span>
<span class="s0">send to his father-in-law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off</span>
<span class="s0">as a bachelor.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with</span>
<span class="s0">others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had</span>
<span class="s0">never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of</span>
<span class="s0">considering how his actions might affect others or what the</span>
<span class="s0">consequences of this or that action of his might be. He was</span>
<span class="s0">convinced that, as a duck is so made that it must live in water, so</span>
<span class="s0">God had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year</span>
<span class="s0">and always occupy a prominent position in society. He believed this so</span>
<span class="s0">firmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of it too and did</span>
<span class="s0">not refuse him either a leading place in society or money, which he</span>
<span class="s0">borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay.</span>

<span class="s0">He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning.</span>
<span class="s0">He was not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still</span>
<span class="s0">less could he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed</span>
<span class="s0">his father by spoiling his own career, and he laughed at</span>
<span class="s0">distinctions of all kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse</span>
<span class="s0">anyone who asked of him. All he cared about was gaiety and women,</span>
<span class="s0">and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in</span>
<span class="s0">these tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the</span>
<span class="s0">gratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly</span>
<span class="s0">considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad</span>
<span class="s0">people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.</span>

<span class="s0">Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence</span>
<span class="s0">similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope</span>
<span class="s0">of forgiveness. &quot;All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all</span>
<span class="s0">will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and</span>
<span class="s0">his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling,</span>
<span class="s0">and dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kuragin</span>
<span class="s0">and made use of him for his own ends.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole was sincerely fond of Dolokhov for his cleverness and</span>
<span class="s0">audacity. Dolokhov, who needed Anatole Kuragin's name, position, and</span>
<span class="s0">connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set,</span>
<span class="s0">made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting</span>
<span class="s0">the other feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole,</span>
<span class="s0">the very process of dominating another's will was in itself a</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure, a habit, and a necessity to Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin. At supper after the</span>
<span class="s0">opera he described to Dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the</span>
<span class="s0">attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his</span>
<span class="s0">intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was</span>
<span class="s0">incapable of considering what might come of such love-making, as he</span>
<span class="s0">never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She's first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,&quot; said Anatole. &quot;Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You'd better wait till she's married....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">pursued Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have been caught once already by a 'little girl,'&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov who knew of Kuragin's marriage. &quot;Take care!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, that can't happen twice! Eh?&quot; said Anatole, with a</span>
<span class="s0">good-humored laugh.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">The day after the opera the Rostovs went nowhere and nobody came</span>
<span class="s0">to see them. Marya Dmitrievna talked to the count about something</span>
<span class="s0">which they concealed from Natasha. Natasha guessed they were talking</span>
<span class="s0">about the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and</span>
<span class="s0">offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice</span>
<span class="s0">that day sent a manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he</span>
<span class="s0">had come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now than during her</span>
<span class="s0">first days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining for him were now</span>
<span class="s0">added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety of which she did not</span>
<span class="s0">understand the cause. She continually fancied that either he would</span>
<span class="s0">never come or that something would happen to her before he came. She</span>
<span class="s0">could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she</span>
<span class="s0">had done before. As soon as she began to think of him, the</span>
<span class="s0">recollection of the old prince, of Princess Mary, of the theater,</span>
<span class="s0">and of Kuragin mingled with her thoughts. The question again presented</span>
<span class="s0">itself whether she was not guilty, whether she had not already</span>
<span class="s0">broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found herself recalling</span>
<span class="s0">to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and every shade in</span>
<span class="s0">the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to</span>
<span class="s0">arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To</span>
<span class="s0">the family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less</span>
<span class="s0">tranquil and happy than before.</span>

<span class="s0">On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to Mass at</span>
<span class="s0">her parish church--the Church of the Assumption built over the</span>
<span class="s0">graves of victims of the plague.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't like those fashionable churches,&quot; she said, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">priding herself on her independence of thought. &quot;God is the same every</span>
<span class="s0">where. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently</span>
<span class="s0">and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is there</span>
<span class="s0">in giving concerts in the choir? I don't like it, it's just</span>
<span class="s0">self-indulgence!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her</span>
<span class="s0">whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the</span>
<span class="s0">servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church.</span>
<span class="s0">At her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had</span>
<span class="s0">vodka and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was</span>
<span class="s0">the holiday so noticeable as in Marya Dmitrievna's broad, stern</span>
<span class="s0">face, which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.</span>

<span class="s0">After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room</span>
<span class="s0">where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a</span>
<span class="s0">servant announced that the carriage was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna</span>
<span class="s0">rose with a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid</span>
<span class="s0">calls, and announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski to have an explanation with him about Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited</span>
<span class="s0">on the Rostovs, and Natasha, very glad of this diversion, having</span>
<span class="s0">shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied</span>
<span class="s0">herself trying on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice</span>
<span class="s0">without sleeves and only tacked together, and was turning her head</span>
<span class="s0">to see in the glass how the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room</span>
<span class="s0">the animated sounds of her father's voice and another's--a woman's-</span>
<span class="s0">that made her flush. It was Helene. Natasha had not time to take off</span>
<span class="s0">the bodice before the door opened and Countess Bezukhova, dressed in a</span>
<span class="s0">purple velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with</span>
<span class="s0">good-humored amiable smiles.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, my enchantress!&quot; she cried to the blushing Natasha.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">she to Count Rostov who had followed her in. &quot;How can you live in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and go nowhere? No, I won't let you off! Mademoiselle George</span>
<span class="s0">will recite at my house tonight and there'll be some people, and if</span>
<span class="s0">you don't bring your lovely girls--who are prettier than</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle George--I won't know you! My husband is away in Tver or I</span>
<span class="s0">would send him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must!</span>
<span class="s0">Between eight and nine.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied</span>
<span class="s0">respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the</span>
<span class="s0">looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely.</span>
<span class="s0">She did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually</span>
<span class="s0">praising Natasha's beauty. She looked at Natasha's dresses and praised</span>
<span class="s0">them, as well as a new dress of her own made of &quot;metallic gauze,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">which she had received from Paris, and advised Natasha to have one</span>
<span class="s0">like it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But anything suits you, my charmer!&quot; she remarked.</span>

<span class="s0">A smile of pleasure never left Natasha's face. She felt happy and as</span>
<span class="s0">if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess</span>
<span class="s0">Bezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and</span>
<span class="s0">important and was now so kind to her. Natasha brightened up and felt</span>
<span class="s0">almost in love with this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind.</span>
<span class="s0">Helene for her part was sincerely delighted with Natasha and wished to</span>
<span class="s0">give her a good time. Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">together, and she was calling on the Rostovs for that purpose. The</span>
<span class="s0">idea of throwing her brother and Natasha together amused her.</span>

<span class="s0">Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">for drawing Boris away, she did not think of that now, and in her</span>
<span class="s0">own way heartily wished Natasha well. As she was leaving the Rostovs</span>
<span class="s0">she called her protegee aside.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My brother dined with me yesterday--we nearly died of laughter-</span>
<span class="s0">he ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly,</span>
<span class="s0">quite madly, in love with you, my dear.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!&quot; said Helene. &quot;You</span>
<span class="s0">must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a</span>
<span class="s0">reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your</span>
<span class="s0">fiance would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to</span>
<span class="s0">death.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre--that</span>
<span class="s0">good Pierre--have talked and laughed about this. So it's all right.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">And again, under Helene's influence, what had seemed terrible now</span>
<span class="s0">seemed simple and natural. &quot;And she is such a grande dame, so kind,</span>
<span class="s0">and evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, gazing at Helene with wide-open, wondering eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having</span>
<span class="s0">evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince's. She was still too</span>
<span class="s0">agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly.</span>
<span class="s0">In answer to the count's inquiries she replied that things were all</span>
<span class="s0">right and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of</span>
<span class="s0">Countess Bezukhova's visit and the invitation for that evening,</span>
<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna remarked:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't care to have anything to do with Bezukhova and don't advise</span>
<span class="s0">you to; however, if you've promised--go. It will divert your</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts,&quot; she added, addressing Natasha.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">Count Rostov took the girls to Countess Bezukhova's. There were a</span>
<span class="s0">good many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natasha. Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost</span>
<span class="s0">entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct.</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle George was standing in a corner of the drawing room</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by young men. There were several Frenchmen present, among</span>
<span class="s0">them Metivier who from the time Helene reached Moscow had been an</span>
<span class="s0">intimate in her house. The count decided not to sit down to cards or</span>
<span class="s0">let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">George's performance was over.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rostovs.</span>
<span class="s0">Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">followed her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same</span>
<span class="s0">feeling she had had at the opera--gratified vanity at his admiration</span>
<span class="s0">of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them.</span>

<span class="s0">Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of</span>
<span class="s0">her beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George</span>
<span class="s0">went out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people</span>
<span class="s0">began arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a</span>
<span class="s0">chair for Natasha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count,</span>
<span class="s0">who never lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down</span>
<span class="s0">behind her.</span>

<span class="s0">Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red</span>
<span class="s0">shawl draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for</span>
<span class="s0">her, and assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was</span>
<span class="s0">audible.</span>

<span class="s0">Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience</span>
<span class="s0">and began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for</span>
<span class="s0">her son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,</span>
<span class="s0">lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse</span>
<span class="s0">sounds, rolling her eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Adorable! divine! delicious!&quot; was heard from every side.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor</span>
<span class="s0">understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt</span>
<span class="s0">herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless world-</span>
<span class="s0">so remote from her old world--a world in which it was impossible to</span>
<span class="s0">know what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole, and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened</span>
<span class="s0">sense of expectancy.</span>

<span class="s0">After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How beautiful she is!&quot; Natasha remarked to her father who had</span>
<span class="s0">also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't think so when I look at you!&quot; said Anatole, following</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;You are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never</span>
<span class="s0">ceased...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come, come, Natasha!&quot; said the count, as he turned back for his</span>
<span class="s0">daughter. &quot;How beautiful she is!&quot; Natasha without saying anything</span>
<span class="s0">stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring</span>
<span class="s0">eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and</span>
<span class="s0">Countess Bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.</span>

<span class="s0">The count wished to go home, but Helene entreated him not to spoil</span>
<span class="s0">her improvised ball, and the Rostovs stayed on. Anatole asked</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand</span>
<span class="s0">and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the</span>
<span class="s0">ecossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when</span>
<span class="s0">they happened to be by themselves, but merely gazed at her. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">lifted her frightened eyes to him, but there was such confident</span>
<span class="s0">tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not,</span>
<span class="s0">whilst looking at him, say what she had to say. She lowered her eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't speak to me of that! What can I do?&quot; said he. &quot;I tell you I</span>
<span class="s0">am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are</span>
<span class="s0">enchanting?... It's our turn to begin.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open</span>
<span class="s0">frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly</span>
<span class="s0">anything that went on that evening. They danced the ecossaise and</span>
<span class="s0">the Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to</span>
<span class="s0">remain. Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her</span>
<span class="s0">father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that</span>
<span class="s0">Helene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother's love,</span>
<span class="s0">and that she again met Anatole in the little sitting room. Helene</span>
<span class="s0">had disappeared leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and</span>
<span class="s0">said in a tender voice:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never</span>
<span class="s0">see you? I love you madly. Can I never...?&quot; and, blocking her path, he</span>
<span class="s0">brought his face close to hers.</span>

<span class="s0">His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she</span>
<span class="s0">saw nothing but them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natalie?&quot; he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being</span>
<span class="s0">painfully pressed. &quot;Natalie?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't understand. I have nothing to say,&quot; her eyes replied.</span>

<span class="s0">Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she</span>
<span class="s0">felt herself released, and Helene's footsteps and the rustle of her</span>
<span class="s0">dress were heard in the room. Natasha looked round at her, and then,</span>
<span class="s0">red and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and</span>
<span class="s0">moved toward the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One word, just one, for God's sake!&quot; cried Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to</span>
<span class="s0">her what had happened and to which she could find no answer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natalie, just a word, only one!&quot; he kept repeating, evidently not</span>
<span class="s0">knowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene came up to them.</span>

<span class="s0">Helene returned with Natasha to the drawing room. The Rostovs went</span>
<span class="s0">away without staying for supper.</span>

<span class="s0">After reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night. She was</span>
<span class="s0">tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew. She loved Prince Andrew--she remembered distinctly</span>
<span class="s0">how deeply she loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there</span>
<span class="s0">was no doubt. &quot;Else how could all this have happened?&quot; thought she.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;If, after that, I could return his smile when saying good-by, if I</span>
<span class="s0">was able to let it come to that, it means that I loved him from the</span>
<span class="s0">first. It means that he is kind, noble, and splendid, and I could</span>
<span class="s0">not help loving him. What am I to do if I love him and the other one</span>
<span class="s0">too?&quot; she asked herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible</span>
<span class="s0">questions.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began to</span>
<span class="s0">move about and talk, dressmakers came again. Marya Dmitrievna</span>
<span class="s0">appeared, and they were called to breakfast. Natasha kept looking</span>
<span class="s0">uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to</span>
<span class="s0">intercept every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the</span>
<span class="s0">same as usual.</span>

<span class="s0">After breakfast, which was her best time, Marya Dmitrievna sat</span>
<span class="s0">down in her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is</span>
<span class="s0">my advice,&quot; she began. &quot;Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to</span>
<span class="s0">begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had</span>
<span class="s0">to say!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, and he?&quot; asked the count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He? He's crazy... he did not want to listen. But what's the use</span>
<span class="s0">of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,&quot; said Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna. &quot;My advice to you is finish your business and go back home</span>
<span class="s0">to Otradnoe... and wait there.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; exclaimed Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, go back,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna, &quot;and wait there. If your</span>
<span class="s0">betrothed comes here now--there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but</span>
<span class="s0">alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to</span>
<span class="s0">you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostov approved of this suggestion, appreciating its</span>
<span class="s0">reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better</span>
<span class="s0">to visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the</span>
<span class="s0">wedding, against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otradnoe.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took</span>
<span class="s0">her,&quot; said the old count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But</span>
<span class="s0">if he won't--that's his affair,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna, looking for</span>
<span class="s0">something in her reticule. &quot;Besides, the trousseau is ready, so</span>
<span class="s0">there is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I'll send after</span>
<span class="s0">you. Though I don't like letting you go, it is the best way. So go,</span>
<span class="s0">with God's blessing!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed</span>
<span class="s0">it to Natasha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She's</span>
<span class="s0">afraid you might think that she does not like you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But she doesn't like me,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't talk nonsense!&quot; cried Marya Dmitrievna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I shan't believe anyone, I know she doesn't like me,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold</span>
<span class="s0">and angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her</span>
<span class="s0">more intently and to frown.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't answer like that, my good girl!&quot; she said. &quot;What I say is</span>
<span class="s0">true! Write an answer!&quot; Natasha did not reply and went to her own room</span>
<span class="s0">to read Princess Mary's letter.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the</span>
<span class="s0">misunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father's</span>
<span class="s0">feelings might be, she begged Natasha to believe that she could not</span>
<span class="s0">help loving her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose</span>
<span class="s0">happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do not think, however,&quot; she wrote, &quot;that my father is</span>
<span class="s0">ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be</span>
<span class="s0">forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes</span>
<span class="s0">his son happy.&quot; Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time</span>
<span class="s0">when she could see her again.</span>

<span class="s0">After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to</span>
<span class="s0">answer it. &quot;Dear Princess,&quot; she wrote in French quickly and</span>
<span class="s0">mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all</span>
<span class="s0">that had happened the evening before? &quot;Yes, yes! All that has</span>
<span class="s0">happened, and now all is changed,&quot; she thought as she sat with the</span>
<span class="s0">letter she had begun before her. &quot;Must I break off with him? Must I</span>
<span class="s0">really? That's awful...&quot; and to escape from these dreadful thoughts</span>
<span class="s0">she went to Sonya and began sorting patterns with her.</span>

<span class="s0">After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary's letter. &quot;Can it be that it is all over?&quot; she thought. &quot;Can it</span>
<span class="s0">be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that</span>
<span class="s0">went before?&quot; She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its</span>
<span class="s0">former strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin. She</span>
<span class="s0">vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew's wife, and the scenes of</span>
<span class="s0">happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and</span>
<span class="s0">at the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of</span>
<span class="s0">yesterday's interview with Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why could that not be as well?&quot; she sometimes asked herself in</span>
<span class="s0">complete bewilderment. &quot;Only so could I be completely happy; but now I</span>
<span class="s0">have to choose, and I can't be happy without either of them. Only,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she thought, &quot;to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it</span>
<span class="s0">from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is</span>
<span class="s0">spoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew's</span>
<span class="s0">love, in which I have lived so long?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Please, Miss!&quot; whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious</span>
<span class="s0">air. &quot;A man told me to give you this-&quot; and she handed Natasha a</span>
<span class="s0">letter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Only, for Christ's sake...&quot; the girl went on, as Natasha, without</span>
<span class="s0">thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only</span>
<span class="s0">that it was a letter from him--from the man she loved. Yes, she</span>
<span class="s0">loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?</span>
<span class="s0">And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand?</span>

<span class="s0">With trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter</span>
<span class="s0">which Dolokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she</span>
<span class="s0">found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you</span>
<span class="s0">or to die. There is no other way for me,&quot; the letter began. Then he</span>
<span class="s0">went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him--for</span>
<span class="s0">this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her--but that</span>
<span class="s0">if she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power</span>
<span class="s0">could hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her</span>
<span class="s0">away and carry her off to the ends of the earth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes! I love him!&quot; thought Natasha, reading the letter for</span>
<span class="s0">the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each</span>
<span class="s0">word of it.</span>

<span class="s0">That evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs' and</span>
<span class="s0">proposed to take the girls with her. Natasha, pleading a headache,</span>
<span class="s0">remained at home.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">On returning late in the evening Sonya went to Natasha's room, and</span>
<span class="s0">to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open</span>
<span class="s0">on the table, beside her lay Anatole's letter. Sonya picked it up</span>
<span class="s0">and read it.</span>

<span class="s0">As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natasha, trying to find in</span>
<span class="s0">her face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find</span>
<span class="s0">it. Her face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep</span>
<span class="s0">herself from choking, Sonya, pale and trembling with fear and</span>
<span class="s0">agitation, sat down in an armchair and burst into tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she</span>
<span class="s0">have left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kuragin go</span>
<span class="s0">to such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that's plain! What</span>
<span class="s0">will Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is</span>
<span class="s0">the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before</span>
<span class="s0">yesterday, yesterday, and today,&quot; thought Sonya. &quot;But it can't be that</span>
<span class="s0">she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who it</span>
<span class="s0">was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a</span>
<span class="s0">thing!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya wiped away her tears and went up to Natasha, again scanning</span>
<span class="s0">her face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha!&quot; she said, just audibly.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha awoke and saw Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, you're back?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment</span>
<span class="s0">of awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sonya's look of</span>
<span class="s0">embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, you've read that letter?&quot; she demanded.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Sonya softly.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha smiled rapturously.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, Sonya, I can't any longer!&quot; she said. &quot;I can't hide it from you</span>
<span class="s0">any longer. You know, we love one another! Sonya, darling, he</span>
<span class="s0">writes... Sonya...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya stared open-eyed at Natasha, unable to believe her ears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And Bolkonski?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!&quot; cried Natasha. &quot;You</span>
<span class="s0">don't know what love is....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But, Natasha, can that be all over?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not</span>
<span class="s0">grasp the question.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, you don't understand anything! Don't talk nonsense, just</span>
<span class="s0">listen!&quot; said Natasha, with momentary vexation.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I can't believe it,&quot; insisted Sonya. &quot;I don't understand. How</span>
<span class="s0">is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you</span>
<span class="s0">have only seen him three times! Natasha, I don't believe you, you're</span>
<span class="s0">joking! In three days to forget everything and so...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Three days?&quot; said Natasha. &quot;It seems to me I've loved him a hundred</span>
<span class="s0">years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can't</span>
<span class="s0">understand it.... Sonya, wait a bit, sit here,&quot; and Natasha embraced</span>
<span class="s0">and kissed her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it</span>
<span class="s0">too, but it's only now that I feel such love. It's not the same as</span>
<span class="s0">before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his</span>
<span class="s0">slave, and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave!</span>
<span class="s0">Whatever he orders I shall do. You don't understand that. What can I</span>
<span class="s0">do? What can I do, Sonya?&quot; cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened</span>
<span class="s0">expression.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But think what you are doing,&quot; cried Sonya. &quot;I can't leave it</span>
<span class="s0">like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so</span>
<span class="s0">far?&quot; she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I told you that I have no will,&quot; Natasha replied. &quot;Why can't you</span>
<span class="s0">understand? I love him!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then I won't let it come to that... I shall tell!&quot; cried Sonya,</span>
<span class="s0">bursting into tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What do you mean? For God's sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">declared Natasha. &quot;You want me to be miserable, you want us to be</span>
<span class="s0">separated....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When she saw Natasha's fright, Sonya shed tears of shame and pity</span>
<span class="s0">for her friend.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what has happened between you?&quot; she asked. &quot;What has he said to</span>
<span class="s0">you? Why doesn't he come to the house?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha did not answer her questions.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha entreated. &quot;Remember no one ought to interfere in such</span>
<span class="s0">matters! I have confided in you....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why this secrecy? Why doesn't he come to the house?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya. &quot;Why doesn't he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew gave you complete freedom--if it is really so; but I don't</span>
<span class="s0">believe it! Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can</span>
<span class="s0">be?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment. Evidently this question</span>
<span class="s0">presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know</span>
<span class="s0">how to answer it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If there were reasons...&quot; she began.</span>

<span class="s0">But Natasha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, one can't doubt him! One can't, one can't! Don't you</span>
<span class="s0">understand?&quot; she cried.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Does he love you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Does he love me?&quot; Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her</span>
<span class="s0">friend's lack of comprehension. &quot;Why, you have read his letter and you</span>
<span class="s0">have seen him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But if he is dishonorable?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He! dishonorable? If you only knew!&quot; exclaimed Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions</span>
<span class="s0">or cease seeing you; and if you won't do this, I will. I will write to</span>
<span class="s0">him, and I will tell Papa!&quot; said Sonya resolutely.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I can't live without him!&quot; cried Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, I don't understand you. And what are you saying! Think</span>
<span class="s0">of your father and of Nicholas.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't want anyone, I don't love anyone but him. How dare you</span>
<span class="s0">say he is dishonorable? Don't you know that I love him?&quot; screamed</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. &quot;Go away, Sonya! I don't want to quarrel with you, but go,</span>
<span class="s0">for God's sake go! You see how I am suffering!&quot; Natasha cried angrily,</span>
<span class="s0">in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. Sonya burst into</span>
<span class="s0">sobs and ran from the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha went to the table and without a moment's reflection wrote</span>
<span class="s0">that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all</span>
<span class="s0">the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their</span>
<span class="s0">misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her</span>
<span class="s0">freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her</span>
<span class="s0">if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife.</span>
<span class="s0">At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Natasha.</span>


<span class="s0">On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country, but on</span>
<span class="s0">Wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his</span>
<span class="s0">estate near Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">On the day the count left, Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big</span>
<span class="s0">dinner party at the Karagins', and Marya Dmitrievna took them there.</span>
<span class="s0">At that party Natasha again met Anatole, and Sonya noticed that she</span>
<span class="s0">spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through</span>
<span class="s0">dinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home Natasha was</span>
<span class="s0">the first to begin the explanation Sonya expected.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, Sonya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to</span>
<span class="s0">be praised. &quot;We have had an explanation today.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what happened? What did he say? Natasha, how glad I am you're</span>
<span class="s0">not angry with me! Tell me everything--the whole truth. What did he</span>
<span class="s0">say?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha became thoughtful.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I</span>
<span class="s0">had promised Bolkonski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya sighed sorrowfully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you haven't refused Bolkonski?&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski. Why</span>
<span class="s0">do you think so badly of me?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't think anything, only I don't understand this...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wait a bit, Sonya, you'll understand everything. You'll see what</span>
<span class="s0">a man he is! Now don't think badly of me or of him. I don't think</span>
<span class="s0">badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her.</span>
<span class="s0">The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha's face</span>
<span class="s0">became, the more serious and stern grew Sonya's.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha,&quot; said she, &quot;you asked me not to speak to you, and I</span>
<span class="s0">haven't spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don't trust him,</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. Why this secrecy?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Again, again!&quot; interrupted Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, I am afraid for you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Afraid of what?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am afraid you're going to your ruin,&quot; said Sonya resolutely,</span>
<span class="s0">and was herself horrified at what she had said.</span>

<span class="s0">Anger again showed in Natasha's face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I'll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It's not</span>
<span class="s0">your business! It won't be you, but I, who'll suffer. Leave me</span>
<span class="s0">alone, leave me alone! I hate you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha!&quot; moaned Sonya, aghast.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I hate you, I hate you! You're my enemy forever!&quot; And Natasha ran</span>
<span class="s0">out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her. With the</span>
<span class="s0">same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the</span>
<span class="s0">house, taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once</span>
<span class="s0">abandoning them.</span>

<span class="s0">Hard as it was for Sonya, she watched her friend and did not let her</span>
<span class="s0">out of her sight.</span>

<span class="s0">The day before the count was to return, Sonya noticed that Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting</span>
<span class="s0">something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past,</span>
<span class="s0">whom Sonya took to be Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed</span>
<span class="s0">that at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and</span>
<span class="s0">unnatural state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she</span>
<span class="s0">did not finish, and laughed at everything.</span>

<span class="s0">After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha's door timidly</span>
<span class="s0">waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at</span>
<span class="s0">the door learned that another letter had been delivered.</span>

<span class="s0">Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some</span>
<span class="s0">dreadful plan for that evening. Sonya knocked at her door. Natasha did</span>
<span class="s0">not let her in.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She will run away with him!&quot; thought Sonya. &quot;She is capable of</span>
<span class="s0">anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in</span>
<span class="s0">her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,&quot; Sonya</span>
<span class="s0">remembered. &quot;Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what</span>
<span class="s0">am I to do?&quot; thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly</span>
<span class="s0">indicated that Natasha had some terrible intention. &quot;The count is</span>
<span class="s0">away. What am I to do? Write to Kuragin demanding an explanation?</span>
<span class="s0">But what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she</span>
<span class="s0">really has already refused Bolkonski--she sent a letter to Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary yesterday. And Uncle is away....&quot; To tell Marya Dmitrievna who</span>
<span class="s0">had such faith in Natasha seemed to Sonya terrible. &quot;Well, anyway,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">thought Sonya as she stood in the dark passage, &quot;now or never I must</span>
<span class="s0">prove that I remember the family's goodness to me and that I love</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas. Yes! If I don't sleep for three nights I'll not leave this</span>
<span class="s0">passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the</span>
<span class="s0">family be disgraced,&quot; thought she.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">Anatole had lately moved to Dolokhov's. The plan for Natalie</span>
<span class="s0">Rostova's abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov a few days before, and on the day that Sonya, after listening</span>
<span class="s0">at Natasha's door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been</span>
<span class="s0">put into execution. Natasha had promised to come out to Kuragin at the</span>
<span class="s0">back porch at ten that evening. Kuragin was to put her into a troyka</span>
<span class="s0">he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of</span>
<span class="s0">Kamenka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a</span>
<span class="s0">marriage ceremony over them. At Kamenka a relay of horses was to</span>
<span class="s0">wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they</span>
<span class="s0">would hasten abroad with post horses.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand</span>
<span class="s0">rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand</span>
<span class="s0">borrowed with Dolokhov's help.</span>

<span class="s0">Two witnesses for the mock marriage--Khvostikov, a retired petty</span>
<span class="s0">official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and</span>
<span class="s0">Makarin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an</span>
<span class="s0">unbounded affection for Kuragin--were sitting at tea in Dolokhov's</span>
<span class="s0">front room.</span>

<span class="s0">In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with</span>
<span class="s0">Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dolokhov in a traveling</span>
<span class="s0">cloak and high boots, at an open desk on which lay abacus and some</span>
<span class="s0">bundles of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to</span>
<span class="s0">and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the</span>
<span class="s0">study to the room behind, where his French valet and others were</span>
<span class="s0">packing the last of his things. Dolokhov was counting the money and</span>
<span class="s0">noting something down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Khvostikov must have two thousand.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give it to him, then,&quot; said Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Makarka&quot; (their name for Makarin) &quot;will go through fire and water</span>
<span class="s0">for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov, showing him the memorandum. &quot;Is that right?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; returned Anatole, evidently not listening to</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not</span>
<span class="s0">leave his face.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to Anatole with an</span>
<span class="s0">ironic smile:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know? You'd really better drop it all. There's still time!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fool,&quot; retorted Anatole. &quot;Don't talk nonsense! If you only</span>
<span class="s0">knew... it's the devil knows what!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, really, give it up!&quot; said Dolokhov. &quot;I am speaking seriously.</span>
<span class="s0">It's no joke, this plot you've hatched.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?&quot; said Anatole, making a</span>
<span class="s0">grimace. &quot;Really it's no time for your stupid jokes,&quot; and he left</span>
<span class="s0">the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole</span>
<span class="s0">had gone out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You wait a bit,&quot; he called after him. &quot;I'm not joking, I'm</span>
<span class="s0">talking sense. Come here, come here!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov, trying to give him his</span>
<span class="s0">attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now listen to me. I'm telling you this for the last time. Why</span>
<span class="s0">should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything</span>
<span class="s0">for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the</span>
<span class="s0">money? I did it all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?&quot; And</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a</span>
<span class="s0">dangerous business, and if you think about it--a stupid business.</span>
<span class="s0">Well, you'll carry her off--all right! Will they let it stop at</span>
<span class="s0">that? It will come out that you're already married. Why, they'll</span>
<span class="s0">have you in the criminal court....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, nonsense, nonsense!&quot; Anatole ejaculated and again made a</span>
<span class="s0">grimace. &quot;Didn't I explain to you? What?&quot; And Anatole, with the</span>
<span class="s0">partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have</span>
<span class="s0">reached by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already</span>
<span class="s0">put to Dolokhov a hundred times. &quot;Didn't I explain to you that I</span>
<span class="s0">have come to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,&quot; he went</span>
<span class="s0">on, crooking one finger, &quot;then I have nothing to answer for; but if it</span>
<span class="s0">is valid, no matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it.</span>
<span class="s0">Isn't that so? And don't talk to me, don't, don't.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Seriously, you'd better drop it! You'll only get yourself into a</span>
<span class="s0">mess!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go to the devil!&quot; cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the</span>
<span class="s0">room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov with his feet turned under him. &quot;It's the very devil! What?</span>
<span class="s0">Feel how it beats!&quot; He took Dolokhov's hand and put it on his heart.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;What a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!&quot; he added in</span>
<span class="s0">French. &quot;What?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes</span>
<span class="s0">looked at him--evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well and when the money's gone, what then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What then? Eh?&quot; repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a</span>
<span class="s0">thought of the future. &quot;What then?... Then, I don't know.... But why</span>
<span class="s0">talk nonsense!&quot; He glanced at his watch. &quot;It's time!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole went into the back room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!&quot; he shouted to the</span>
<span class="s0">servants.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to</span>
<span class="s0">bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went</span>
<span class="s0">into the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and</span>
<span class="s0">smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to</span>
<span class="s0">himself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come and eat something. Have a drink!&quot; Dolokhov shouted to him from</span>
<span class="s0">the other room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't want to,&quot; answered Anatole continuing to smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come! Balaga is here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balaga was a famous</span>
<span class="s0">troyka driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and</span>
<span class="s0">had given them good service with his troykas. More than once when</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole's regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in</span>
<span class="s0">the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back</span>
<span class="s0">again the next night. More than once he had enabled Dolokhov to escape</span>
<span class="s0">when pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town</span>
<span class="s0">with gypsies and &quot;ladykins&quot; as he called the cocottes. More than</span>
<span class="s0">once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles</span>
<span class="s0">in the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the</span>
<span class="s0">consequences by &quot;my gentlemen&quot; as he called them. He had ruined more</span>
<span class="s0">than one horse in their service. More than once they had beaten him,</span>
<span class="s0">and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira,</span>
<span class="s0">which he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of them</span>
<span class="s0">which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They</span>
<span class="s0">often called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance</span>
<span class="s0">at the gypsies', and more than one thousand rubles of their money</span>
<span class="s0">had passed through his hands. In their service he risked his skin</span>
<span class="s0">and his life twenty times a year, and in their service had lost more</span>
<span class="s0">horses than the money he had from them would buy. But he liked them;</span>
<span class="s0">liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a</span>
<span class="s0">driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full gallop through</span>
<span class="s0">the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind</span>
<span class="s0">him: &quot;Get on! Get on!&quot; when it was impossible to go any faster. He</span>
<span class="s0">liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead</span>
<span class="s0">than alive, was already hurrying out of his way. &quot;Real gentlemen!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he considered them.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and</span>
<span class="s0">because he liked the things they liked. With others Balaga</span>
<span class="s0">bargained, charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours' drive, and</span>
<span class="s0">rarely drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But</span>
<span class="s0">with &quot;his gentlemen&quot; he always drove himself and never demanded</span>
<span class="s0">anything for his work. Only a couple of times a year--when he knew</span>
<span class="s0">from their valets that they had money in hand--he would turn up of a</span>
<span class="s0">morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him.</span>
<span class="s0">The gentlemen always made him sit down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir,&quot; or &quot;your excellency,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">would say. &quot;I am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to go</span>
<span class="s0">to the fair.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Anatole and Dolokhov, when they had money, would give him a</span>
<span class="s0">thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.</span>

<span class="s0">Balaga was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck,</span>
<span class="s0">glittering little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine,</span>
<span class="s0">dark-blue, silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin.</span>

<span class="s0">On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the</span>
<span class="s0">front corner of the room, and went up to Dolokhov, holding out a</span>
<span class="s0">small, black hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Theodore Ivanych!&quot; he said, bowing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How d'you do, friend? Well, here he is!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good day, your excellency!&quot; he said, again holding out his hand</span>
<span class="s0">to Anatole who had just come in.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say, Balaga,&quot; said Anatole, putting his hands on the man's</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders, &quot;do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....</span>
<span class="s0">What horses have you come with? Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;As your messenger ordered, your special beasts,&quot; replied Balaga.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, listen, Balaga! Drive all three to death but get me there</span>
<span class="s0">in three hours. Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When they are dead, what shall I drive?&quot; said Balaga with a wink.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mind, I'll smash your face in! Don't make jokes!&quot; cried Anatole,</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly rolling his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why joke?&quot; said the driver, laughing. &quot;As if I'd grudge my</span>
<span class="s0">gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast</span>
<span class="s0">we'll go!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Anatole. &quot;Well, sit down.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sit down!&quot; said Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll stand, Theodore Ivanych.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!&quot; said Anatole, and filled a large</span>
<span class="s0">glass of Madeira for him.</span>

<span class="s0">The driver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After</span>
<span class="s0">refusing it for manners' sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with</span>
<span class="s0">a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And when are we to start, your excellency?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well...&quot; Anatole looked at his watch. &quot;We'll start at once. Mind,</span>
<span class="s0">Balaga! You'll get there in time? Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn't we be</span>
<span class="s0">there in time?&quot; replied Balaga. &quot;Didn't we get you to Tver in seven</span>
<span class="s0">hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,&quot; said Anatole,</span>
<span class="s0">smilingly at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed</span>
<span class="s0">rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. &quot;Will you believe it, Makarka,</span>
<span class="s0">it took one's breath away, the rate we flew. We came across a train of</span>
<span class="s0">loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Those were horses!&quot; Balaga continued the tale. &quot;That time I'd</span>
<span class="s0">harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,&quot; he went</span>
<span class="s0">on, turning to Dolokhov. &quot;Will you believe it, Theodore Ivanych, those</span>
<span class="s0">animals flew forty miles? I couldn't hold them in, my hands grew</span>
<span class="s0">numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins--'Catch hold</span>
<span class="s0">yourself, your excellency!' says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom</span>
<span class="s0">of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn't a case of urging them</span>
<span class="s0">on, there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils</span>
<span class="s0">took us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later</span>
<span class="s0">wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily</span>
<span class="s0">set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having</span>
<span class="s0">looked in a mirror, and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he</span>
<span class="s0">had assumed before it, he lifted a glass of wine.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Anatole. &quot;Well, comrades and friends...&quot; he considered for a</span>
<span class="s0">moment &quot;...of my youth, farewell!&quot; he said, turning to Makarin and the</span>
<span class="s0">others.</span>

<span class="s0">Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to</span>
<span class="s0">make something touching and solemn out of this address to his</span>
<span class="s0">comrades. He spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest</span>
<span class="s0">slightly swayed one leg.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All take glasses; you too, Balaga. Well, comrades and friends of my</span>
<span class="s0">youth, we've had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when</span>
<span class="s0">shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time--now</span>
<span class="s0">farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...&quot; he cried, and emptying</span>
<span class="s0">his glass flung it on the floor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To your health!&quot; said Balaga who also emptied his glass, and</span>
<span class="s0">wiped his mouth with his handkerchief.</span>

<span class="s0">Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let's go. Let's go!&quot; cried Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">Balaga was about to leave the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, stop!&quot; said Anatole. &quot;Shut the door; we have first to sit down.</span>
<span class="s0">That's the way.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They shut the door and all sat down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, quick march, lads!&quot; said Anatole, rising.</span>

<span class="s0">Joseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all</span>
<span class="s0">went out into the vestibule.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And where's the fur cloak?&quot; asked Dolokhov. &quot;Hey, Ignatka! Go to</span>
<span class="s0">Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what</span>
<span class="s0">elopements are like,&quot; continued Dolokhov with a wink. &quot;Why, she'll</span>
<span class="s0">rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if</span>
<span class="s0">you delay at all there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mamma,' and she's</span>
<span class="s0">frozen in a minute and must go back--but you wrap the fur cloak</span>
<span class="s0">round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The valet brought a woman's fox-lined cloak.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrena, the sable!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms.</span>

<span class="s0">A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black</span>
<span class="s0">eyes and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a</span>
<span class="s0">sable mantle on her arm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here, I don't grudge it--take it!&quot; she said, evidently afraid of</span>
<span class="s0">her master and yet regretful of her cloak.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over</span>
<span class="s0">Matrena, and wrapped her up in it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's the way,&quot; said Dolokhov, &quot;and then so!&quot; and he turned the</span>
<span class="s0">collar up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And then so, do you see?&quot; and he pushed Anatole's head forward to</span>
<span class="s0">meet the gap left by the collar, through which Matrena's brilliant</span>
<span class="s0">smile was seen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good-by, Matrena,&quot; said Anatole, kissing her. &quot;Ah, my</span>
<span class="s0">revels here are over. Remember me to Steshka. There, good-by! Good-by,</span>
<span class="s0">Matrena, wish me luck!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!&quot; said Matrena in her</span>
<span class="s0">gypsy accent.</span>

<span class="s0">Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers</span>
<span class="s0">were holding the horses. Balaga took his seat in the front one and</span>
<span class="s0">holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov got in with him. Makarin, Khvostikov, and a valet seated</span>
<span class="s0">themselves in the other sleigh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, are you ready?&quot; asked Balaga.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go!&quot; he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka</span>
<span class="s0">tore down the Nikitski Boulevard.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...&quot; The shouting of Balaga</span>
<span class="s0">and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be</span>
<span class="s0">heard. On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage;</span>
<span class="s0">something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the</span>
<span class="s0">Arbat Street.</span>

<span class="s0">After taking a turn along the Podnovinski Boulevard, Balaga began to</span>
<span class="s0">rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old</span>
<span class="s0">Konyusheny Street.</span>

<span class="s0">The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole and Dolokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the</span>
<span class="s0">gate Dolokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant</span>
<span class="s0">ran out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come into the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out</span>
<span class="s0">directly,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the</span>
<span class="s0">courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.</span>

<span class="s0">He was met by Gabriel, Marya Dmitrievna's gigantic footman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come to the mistress, please,&quot; said the footman in his deep bass,</span>
<span class="s0">intercepting any retreat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To what Mistress? Who are you?&quot; asked Anatole in a breathless</span>
<span class="s0">whisper.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Kuragin! Come back!&quot; shouted Dolokhov. &quot;Betrayed! Back!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and</span>
<span class="s0">was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With</span>
<span class="s0">a last desperate effort Dolokhov pushed the porter aside, and when</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole ran back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket,</span>
<span class="s0">and ran back with him to the troyka.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna, having found Sonya weeping in the corridor, made</span>
<span class="s0">her confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natasha she</span>
<span class="s0">read it and went into Natasha's room with it in her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You shameless good-for-nothing!&quot; said she. &quot;I won't hear a word.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pushing back Natasha who looked at her with astonished but</span>
<span class="s0">tearless eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the</span>
<span class="s0">yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but</span>
<span class="s0">not to let them out again, and having told the footman to bring them</span>
<span class="s0">up to her, she seated herself in the drawing room to await the</span>
<span class="s0">abductors.</span>

<span class="s0">When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run</span>
<span class="s0">away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced</span>
<span class="s0">through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward</span>
<span class="s0">midnight she went to Natasha's room fingering the key in her pocket.</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. &quot;Marya Dmitrievna, for</span>
<span class="s0">God's sake let me in to her!&quot; she pleaded, but Marya Dmitrievna</span>
<span class="s0">unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer....</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Disgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I'm only</span>
<span class="s0">sorry for her father!&quot; thought she, trying to restrain her wrath.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Hard as it may be, I'll tell them all to hold their tongues and</span>
<span class="s0">will hide it from the count.&quot; She entered the room with resolute</span>
<span class="s0">steps. Natasha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and</span>
<span class="s0">she did not stir. She was in just the same position in which Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna had left her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A nice girl! Very nice!&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna. &quot;Arranging meetings</span>
<span class="s0">with lovers in my house! It's no use pretending: you listen when I</span>
<span class="s0">speak to you!&quot; And Marya Dmitrievna touched her arm. &quot;Listen when when</span>
<span class="s0">I speak! You've disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I'd</span>
<span class="s0">treat you differently, but I'm sorry for your father, so I will</span>
<span class="s0">conceal it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved</span>
<span class="s0">with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Marya Dmitrievna</span>
<span class="s0">glanced round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's lucky for him that he escaped me; but I'll find him!&quot; she said</span>
<span class="s0">in her rough voice. &quot;Do you hear what I am saying or not?&quot; she added.</span>

<span class="s0">She put her large hand under Natasha's face and turned it toward</span>
<span class="s0">her. Both Marya Dmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they saw how</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed,</span>
<span class="s0">her cheeks sunken.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!&quot; she muttered,</span>
<span class="s0">wrenching herself from Marya Dmitrievna's hands with a vicious</span>
<span class="s0">effort and sinking down again into her former position.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natalie!&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna. &quot;I wish for your good. Lie</span>
<span class="s0">still, stay like that then, I won't touch you. But listen. I won't</span>
<span class="s0">tell you how guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your</span>
<span class="s0">father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again Natasha's body shook with sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have no betrothed: I have refused him!&quot; cried Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's all the same,&quot; continued Dmitrievna. &quot;If they hear of</span>
<span class="s0">this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he</span>
<span class="s0">challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who</span>
<span class="s0">asked you to?&quot; shouted Natasha, raising herself on the sofa and</span>
<span class="s0">looking malignantly at Marya Dmitrievna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what did you want?&quot; cried Marya Dmitrievna, growing angry</span>
<span class="s0">again. &quot;Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to</span>
<span class="s0">the house? Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing</span>
<span class="s0">girl?... Well, if he had carried you off... do you think they wouldn't</span>
<span class="s0">have found him? Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he's a</span>
<span class="s0">scoundrel, a wretch--that's a fact!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is better than any of you!&quot; exclaimed Natasha getting up. &quot;If</span>
<span class="s0">you hadn't interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it?</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya, why?... Go away!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which</span>
<span class="s0">people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned.</span>
<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna was to speak again but Natasha cried out:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!&quot; and she threw</span>
<span class="s0">herself back on the sofa.</span>

<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on</span>
<span class="s0">her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that</span>
<span class="s0">nobody would know anything about it if only Natasha herself would</span>
<span class="s0">undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had</span>
<span class="s0">happened. Natasha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she</span>
<span class="s0">grew cold and had a shivering fit. Marya Dmitrievna put a pillow under</span>
<span class="s0">her head, covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some</span>
<span class="s0">lime-flower water, but Natasha did not respond to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, let her sleep,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna as she went of the room</span>
<span class="s0">supposing Natasha to be asleep.</span>

<span class="s0">But Natasha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open</span>
<span class="s0">eyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not</span>
<span class="s0">sleep or weep and did not speak to Sonya who got up and went to her</span>
<span class="s0">several times.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day Count Rostov returned from his estate near Moscow in time</span>
<span class="s0">for lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the</span>
<span class="s0">affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was</span>
<span class="s0">nothing to keep him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess</span>
<span class="s0">whom he missed. Marya Dmitrievna met him and told him that Natasha had</span>
<span class="s0">been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor,</span>
<span class="s0">but that she was better now. Natasha had not left her room that</span>
<span class="s0">morning. With compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she</span>
<span class="s0">sat at the window, uneasily watching the people who drove past and</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room. She was</span>
<span class="s0">evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would</span>
<span class="s0">write to her.</span>

<span class="s0">When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the</span>
<span class="s0">sound of a man's footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and</span>
<span class="s0">malevolent expression. She did not even get up to greet him. &quot;What</span>
<span class="s0">is the matter with you, my angel? Are you ill?&quot; asked the count.</span>

<span class="s0">After a moment's silence Natasha answered: &quot;Yes, ill.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In reply to the count's anxious inquiries as to why she was so</span>
<span class="s0">dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she</span>
<span class="s0">assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry.</span>
<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna confirmed Natasha's assurances that nothing had</span>
<span class="s0">happened. From the pretense of illness, from his daughter's</span>
<span class="s0">distress, and by the embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna, the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during</span>
<span class="s0">his absence, but it was so terrible for him to think that anything</span>
<span class="s0">disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter, and he so prized his</span>
<span class="s0">own cheerful tranquillity, that he avoided inquiries and tried to</span>
<span class="s0">assure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and he was only</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the</span>
<span class="s0">country.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to</span>
<span class="s0">go away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rostovs</span>
<span class="s0">came to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him hasten to</span>
<span class="s0">carry out his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexeevich's</span>
<span class="s0">widow, who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers</span>
<span class="s0">of her deceased husband's.</span>

<span class="s0">When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great</span>
<span class="s0">importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">had been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling</span>
<span class="s0">for her was stronger than a married man's should be for his friend's</span>
<span class="s0">fiancee. Yet some fate constantly threw them together.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What can have happened? And what can they want with me?&quot; thought he</span>
<span class="s0">as he dressed to go to Marya Dmitrievna's. &quot;If only Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">would hurry up and come and marry her!&quot; thought he on his way to the</span>
<span class="s0">house.</span>

<span class="s0">On the Tverskoy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pierre! Been back long?&quot; someone shouted. Pierre raised his head.</span>
<span class="s0">In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering</span>
<span class="s0">the dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makarin</span>
<span class="s0">dashed past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of</span>
<span class="s0">military dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver</span>
<span class="s0">collar and his head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his</span>
<span class="s0">white-plumed hat, tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded</span>
<span class="s0">hair besprinkled with powdery snow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, indeed, that's a true sage,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;He sees</span>
<span class="s0">nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so</span>
<span class="s0">he is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn't I give</span>
<span class="s0">to be like him!&quot; he thought enviously.</span>

<span class="s0">In Marya Dmitrievna's anteroom the footman who helped him off with</span>
<span class="s0">his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.</span>

<span class="s0">When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natasha sitting at the</span>
<span class="s0">window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at</span>
<span class="s0">him, frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What has happened?&quot; asked Pierre, entering Marya Dmitrievna's room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fine doings!&quot; answered Dmitrievna. &quot;For fifty-eight years have I</span>
<span class="s0">lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,</span>
<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna informed him that Natasha had refused Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">without her parents' knowledge and that the cause of this was</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole Kuragin into whose society Pierre's wife had thrown her and</span>
<span class="s0">with whom Natasha had tried to elope during her father's absence, in</span>
<span class="s0">order to be married secretly.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was</span>
<span class="s0">told him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's deeply loved affianced wife--the same Natasha Rostova who</span>
<span class="s0">used to be so charming--should give up Bolkonski for that fool Anatole</span>
<span class="s0">who was already secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in</span>
<span class="s0">love with him as to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">could not conceive and could not imagine.</span>

<span class="s0">He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">whom he had known from a child, with this new conception of her</span>
<span class="s0">baseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. &quot;They are all</span>
<span class="s0">alike!&quot; he said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man</span>
<span class="s0">unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded</span>
<span class="s0">pride, and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with</span>
<span class="s0">contempt and even with disgust of that Natasha who had just passed him</span>
<span class="s0">in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's soul was overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation,</span>
<span class="s0">and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an</span>
<span class="s0">expression of calm dignity and severity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But how get married?&quot; said Pierre, in answer to Marya Dmitrievna.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;He could not marry--he is married!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Things get worse from hour to hour!&quot; ejaculated Marya Dmitrievna.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;A nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she's expecting him--expecting</span>
<span class="s0">him since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won't go on</span>
<span class="s0">expecting him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After hearing the details of Anatole's marriage from Pierre, and</span>
<span class="s0">giving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that</span>
<span class="s0">the count or Bolkonski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew</span>
<span class="s0">of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his</span>
<span class="s0">brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set</span>
<span class="s0">eyes on him again. Pierre--only now realizing the danger to the old</span>
<span class="s0">count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew--promised to do as she wished.</span>
<span class="s0">Having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him, she let him go</span>
<span class="s0">to the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing</span>
<span class="s0">either,&quot; she said. &quot;And I will go and tell her it is no use</span>
<span class="s0">expecting him! And stay to dinner if you care to!&quot; she called after</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha had told him that she had rejected Bolkonski.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!&quot; he said to Pierre. &quot;What</span>
<span class="s0">troubles one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret</span>
<span class="s0">having come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she</span>
<span class="s0">has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody? It's true</span>
<span class="s0">this engagement never was much to my liking. Of course he is an</span>
<span class="s0">excellent man, but still, with his father's disapproval they</span>
<span class="s0">wouldn't have been happy, and Natasha won't lack suitors. Still, it</span>
<span class="s0">has been going on so long, and to take such a step without father's or</span>
<span class="s0">mother's consent! And now she's ill, and God knows what! It's hard,</span>
<span class="s0">Count, hard to manage daughters in their mother's absence....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the</span>
<span class="s0">subject, but the count returned to his troubles.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya entered the room with an agitated face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha is not quite well; she's in her room and would like to</span>
<span class="s0">see you. Marya Dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkonski's, no doubt she wants to</span>
<span class="s0">send him a message,&quot; said the count. &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it</span>
<span class="s0">all was!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the</span>
<span class="s0">room.</span>

<span class="s0">When Marya Dmitrievna told Natasha that Anatole was married, Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre himself. Sonya told Pierre this as she led him along the</span>
<span class="s0">corridor to Natasha's room.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Marya Dmitrievna, and</span>
<span class="s0">her eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look</span>
<span class="s0">the moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed</span>
<span class="s0">fixedly at him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or</span>
<span class="s0">like the others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he</span>
<span class="s0">evidently did not exist for her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He knows all about it,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna pointing to Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">and addressing Natasha. &quot;Let him tell you whether I have told the</span>
<span class="s0">truth.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded</span>
<span class="s0">animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natalya Ilynichna,&quot; Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;whether it is true or not should make no difference to you,</span>
<span class="s0">because...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then it is not true that he's married!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it is true.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Has he been married long?&quot; she asked. &quot;On your honor?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre gave his word of honor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is he still here?&quot; she asked, quickly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I have just seen him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands</span>
<span class="s0">that they should leave her alone.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XX</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at</span>
<span class="s0">once. He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kuragin, at the</span>
<span class="s0">thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a</span>
<span class="s0">difficulty in breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the</span>
<span class="s0">gypsies', nor at Komoneno's. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all</span>
<span class="s0">was going on as usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were</span>
<span class="s0">sitting about in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town</span>
<span class="s0">news. The footman having greeted him, knowing his habits and his</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances, told him there was a place left for him in the small</span>
<span class="s0">dining room and that Prince Michael Zakharych was in the library,</span>
<span class="s0">but Paul Timofeevich had not yet arrived. One of Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances, while they were talking about the weather, asked if</span>
<span class="s0">he had heard of Kuragin's abduction of Rostova which was talked of</span>
<span class="s0">in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it was</span>
<span class="s0">nonsense for he had just come from the Rostovs'. He asked everyone</span>
<span class="s0">about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and another</span>
<span class="s0">that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this calm,</span>
<span class="s0">indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his</span>
<span class="s0">soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come,</span>
<span class="s0">and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove</span>
<span class="s0">home.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate</span>
<span class="s0">affair. It seemed to him essential to see Natasha. In the evening he</span>
<span class="s0">drove to his sister's to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting.</span>
<span class="s0">When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his</span>
<span class="s0">valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The</span>
<span class="s0">countess' drawing room was full of guests.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his</span>
<span class="s0">return--at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever-</span>
<span class="s0">entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Pierre,&quot; said the countess going up to her husband. &quot;You</span>
<span class="s0">don't know what a plight our Anatole...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband's head,</span>
<span class="s0">in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of</span>
<span class="s0">that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced</span>
<span class="s0">after his duel with Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where you are, there is vice and evil!&quot; said Pierre to his wife.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you,&quot; he added in French.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready</span>
<span class="s0">to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward</span>
<span class="s0">himself and was leading him from the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If you allow yourself in my drawing room...&quot; whispered Helene,</span>
<span class="s0">but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face</span>
<span class="s0">betrayed anxiety.</span>

<span class="s0">Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole without looking at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to</span>
<span class="s0">elope with her, is that so?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mon cher,&quot; answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in</span>
<span class="s0">French), &quot;I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to</span>
<span class="s0">me in that tone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him</span>
<span class="s0">from side to side till Anatole's face showed a sufficient degree of</span>
<span class="s0">terror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When I tell you that I must talk to you!...&quot; repeated Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come now, this is stupid. What?&quot; said Anatole, fingering a button</span>
<span class="s0">of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don't know what deprives</span>
<span class="s0">me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!&quot; said Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.</span>

<span class="s0">He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once</span>
<span class="s0">put it back in its place.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did you promise to marry her?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I... I didn't think of it. I never promised, because...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?&quot; he said, moving</span>
<span class="s0">toward Anatole.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his</span>
<span class="s0">pocket and drew out his pocketbook.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table</span>
<span class="s0">that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I shan't be violent, don't be afraid!&quot; said Pierre in answer to a</span>
<span class="s0">frightened gesture of Anatole's. &quot;First, the letters,&quot; said he, as</span>
<span class="s0">if repeating a lesson to himself. &quot;Secondly,&quot; he continued after a</span>
<span class="s0">short pause, again rising and again pacing the room, &quot;tomorrow you</span>
<span class="s0">must get out of Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But how can I?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thirdly,&quot; Pierre continued without listening to him, &quot;you must</span>
<span class="s0">never breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess</span>
<span class="s0">Rostova. I know I can't prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark</span>
<span class="s0">of conscience...&quot; Pierre paced the room several times in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there</span>
<span class="s0">is such a thing as other people's happiness and peace, and that you</span>
<span class="s0">are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse</span>
<span class="s0">yourself with women like my wife--with them you are within your</span>
<span class="s0">rights, for they know what you want of them. They are armed against</span>
<span class="s0">you by the same experience of debauchery; but to promise a maid to</span>
<span class="s0">marry her... to deceive, to kidnap.... Don't you understand that it is</span>
<span class="s0">as mean as beating an old man or a child?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with</span>
<span class="s0">a questioning look.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know about that, eh?&quot; said Anatole, growing more</span>
<span class="s0">confident as Pierre mastered his wrath. &quot;I don't know that and don't</span>
<span class="s0">want to,&quot; he said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of</span>
<span class="s0">his lower jaw, &quot;but you have used such words to me--'mean' and so</span>
<span class="s0">on--which as a man of honor I can't allow anyone to use.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he</span>
<span class="s0">wanted.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Though it was tete-a-tete,&quot; Anatole continued, &quot;still I can't...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it satisfaction you want?&quot; said Pierre ironically.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do</span>
<span class="s0">as you wish, eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I take them back, I take them back!&quot; said Pierre, &quot;and I ask you to</span>
<span class="s0">forgive me.&quot; Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. &quot;And if</span>
<span class="s0">you require money for your journey...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Anatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile,</span>
<span class="s0">which Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, vile and heartless brood!&quot; he exclaimed, and left the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXI</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her of the fulfillment of</span>
<span class="s0">her wish that Kuragin should be banished from Moscow. The whole</span>
<span class="s0">house was in a state of alarm and commotion. Natasha was very ill,</span>
<span class="s0">having, as Marya Dmitrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the</span>
<span class="s0">night after she had been told that Anatole was married, with some</span>
<span class="s0">arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she had</span>
<span class="s0">been so frightened that she woke Sonya and told her what she had done.</span>
<span class="s0">The necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was</span>
<span class="s0">now out of danger, though still so weak that it was out of the</span>
<span class="s0">question to move her to the country, and so the countess had been sent</span>
<span class="s0">for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and Sonya, who had a</span>
<span class="s0">tear-stained face, but he could not see Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip</span>
<span class="s0">about the attempted abduction of Rostova. He resolutely denied these</span>
<span class="s0">rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his</span>
<span class="s0">brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and</span>
<span class="s0">re-establish Natasha's reputation.</span>

<span class="s0">He was awaiting Prince Andrew's return with dread and went every day</span>
<span class="s0">to the old prince's for news of him.</span>

<span class="s0">Old Prince Bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits</span>
<span class="s0">than usual and awaited his son with great impatience.</span>

<span class="s0">Some days after Anatole's departure Pierre received a note from</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come</span>
<span class="s0">to see him.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his</span>
<span class="s0">father Natasha's note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement</span>
<span class="s0">(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and</span>
<span class="s0">given it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's elopement, with additions.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see</span>
<span class="s0">him next morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost</span>
<span class="s0">the same state as Natasha and was therefore surprised on entering</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated</span>
<span class="s0">voice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince's</span>
<span class="s0">voice and another now and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out</span>
<span class="s0">to meet Pierre. She sighed, looking toward the door of the room</span>
<span class="s0">where Prince Andrew was, evidently intending to express her sympathy</span>
<span class="s0">with his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her face that she was glad both</span>
<span class="s0">at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news</span>
<span class="s0">of Natasha's faithlessness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He says he expected it,&quot; she remarked. &quot;I know his pride will not</span>
<span class="s0">let him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far</span>
<span class="s0">better, than I expected. Evidently it had to be....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But is it possible that all is really ended?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not</span>
<span class="s0">understand how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the</span>
<span class="s0">study. Prince Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health,</span>
<span class="s0">but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in</span>
<span class="s0">civilian dress facing his father and Prince Meshcherski, warmly</span>
<span class="s0">disputing and vigorously gesticulating. The conversation was about</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski--the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had</span>
<span class="s0">just reached Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about</span>
<span class="s0">him a month ago,&quot; Prince Andrew was saying, &quot;and by those who were</span>
<span class="s0">unable to understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and</span>
<span class="s0">to throw on him all the blame of other men's mistakes is very easy,</span>
<span class="s0">but I maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this</span>
<span class="s0">reign it was done by him, by him alone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and</span>
<span class="s0">immediately assumed a vindictive expression.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Posterity will do him justice,&quot; he concluded, and at once turned to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?&quot; he said with</span>
<span class="s0">animation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. &quot;Yes, I am</span>
<span class="s0">well,&quot; he said in answer to Pierre's question, and smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">To Pierre that smile said plainly: &quot;I am well, but my health is</span>
<span class="s0">now of no use to anyone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish</span>
<span class="s0">frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">and about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his</span>
<span class="s0">son's tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation</span>
<span class="s0">about Speranski which was still going on between the two old men.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,</span>
<span class="s0">they would have been made public,&quot; he said with warmth and haste. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">do not, and never did, like Speranski personally, but I like justice!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only</span>
<span class="s0">too familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous</span>
<span class="s0">matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too</span>
<span class="s0">intimate. When Prince Meshcherski had left, Prince Andrew took</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A</span>
<span class="s0">bed had been made up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks</span>
<span class="s0">stood about. Prince Andrew went to one and took out a small casket,</span>
<span class="s0">from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently</span>
<span class="s0">and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his</span>
<span class="s0">lips compressed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive me for troubling you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natasha, and his</span>
<span class="s0">broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he</span>
<span class="s0">continued:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard</span>
<span class="s0">reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of</span>
<span class="s0">that kind. Is that true?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Both true and untrue,&quot; Pierre began; but Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here are her letters and her portrait,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give this to the countess... if you see her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She is very ill,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then she is here still?&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;And Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Kuragin?&quot; he added quickly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He left long ago. She has been at death's door.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I much regret her illness,&quot; said Prince Andrew; and he smiled</span>
<span class="s0">like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova with his</span>
<span class="s0">hand?&quot; said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He could not marry, for he was married already,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his</span>
<span class="s0">father.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He has gone to Peters... But I don't know,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, it doesn't matter,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;Tell Countess</span>
<span class="s0">Rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all</span>
<span class="s0">that is good.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember</span>
<span class="s0">whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">would say anything, looked fixedly at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?&quot; asked Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;about...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Prince Andrew hastily. &quot;I said that a fallen woman</span>
<span class="s0">should be forgiven, but I didn't say I could forgive her. I can't.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But can this be compared...?&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: &quot;Yes, ask her</span>
<span class="s0">hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very</span>
<span class="s0">noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman's footsteps. If you</span>
<span class="s0">wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well,</span>
<span class="s0">good-by. So you'll give her the packet?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same</span>
<span class="s0">as always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed</span>
<span class="s0">her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at</span>
<span class="s0">them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to</span>
<span class="s0">mention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone</span>
<span class="s0">else.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was</span>
<span class="s0">becoming evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with</span>
<span class="s0">his father, now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an</span>
<span class="s0">unnatural animation, the cause of which Pierre so well understood.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXII</span>


<span class="s0">That same evening Pierre went to the Rostovs' to fulfill the</span>
<span class="s0">commission entrusted to him. Natasha was in bed, the count at the</span>
<span class="s0">Club, and Pierre, after giving the letters to Sonya, went to Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna who was interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken</span>
<span class="s0">the news. Ten minutes later Sonya came to Marya Dmitrievna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirilovich,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not</span>
<span class="s0">been tidied up.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">Marya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind,</span>
<span class="s0">don't tell her everything!&quot; said she to Pierre. &quot;One hasn't the</span>
<span class="s0">heart to scold her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be</span>
<span class="s0">pitied.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated,</span>
<span class="s0">with a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected</span>
<span class="s0">to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as</span>
<span class="s0">usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her</span>
<span class="s0">arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she</span>
<span class="s0">went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different</span>
<span class="s0">expression of face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Peter Kirilovich,&quot; she began rapidly, &quot;Prince Bolkonski was your</span>
<span class="s0">friend--is your friend,&quot; she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that</span>
<span class="s0">everything that had once been must now be different.) &quot;He told me once</span>
<span class="s0">to apply to you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then</span>
<span class="s0">he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he</span>
<span class="s0">now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for</span>
<span class="s0">reproach.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!&quot; She stopped</span>
<span class="s0">and breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes... I will tell him,&quot; answered Pierre; &quot;but...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He did not know what to say.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think</span>
<span class="s0">she had meant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I know all is over,&quot; she said hurriedly. &quot;No, that can never</span>
<span class="s0">be. I'm only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only</span>
<span class="s0">that I beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.</span>

<span class="s0">A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre's heart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. &quot;But... I should like to know one thing....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Know what?&quot; Natasha's eyes asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I should like to know, did you love...&quot; Pierre did not know how</span>
<span class="s0">to refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him--&quot;did you love</span>
<span class="s0">that bad man?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't call him bad!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;But I don't know, don't know at</span>
<span class="s0">all....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness,</span>
<span class="s0">and love welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his</span>
<span class="s0">spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We won't speak of it any more, my dear,&quot; said Pierre, and his</span>
<span class="s0">gentle, cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We won't speak of it, my dear--I'll tell him everything; but one</span>
<span class="s0">thing I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help,</span>
<span class="s0">advice, or simply to open your heart to someone--not now, but when</span>
<span class="s0">your mind is clearer think of me!&quot; He took her hand and kissed it.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I shall be happy if it's in my power...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre grew confused.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't speak to me like that. I am not worth it!&quot; exclaimed</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha and turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it</span>
<span class="s0">he was amazed at his own words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you,&quot; said he to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Before me? No! All is over for me,&quot; she replied with shame and</span>
<span class="s0">self-abasement.</span>

 <span class="s0">&quot;All over?&quot; he repeated. &quot;If I were not myself, but the handsomest,</span>
<span class="s0">cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this</span>
<span class="s0">moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">For the first time for many days Natasha wept tears of gratitude and</span>
<span class="s0">tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom,</span>
<span class="s0">restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without</span>
<span class="s0">finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his</span>
<span class="s0">sleigh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where to now, your excellency?&quot; asked the coachman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where to?&quot; Pierre asked himself. &quot;Where can I go now? Surely not to</span>
<span class="s0">the Club or to pay calls?&quot; All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in</span>
<span class="s0">comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in</span>
<span class="s0">comparison with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him</span>
<span class="s0">through her tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Home!&quot; said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost</span>
<span class="s0">Fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and</span>
<span class="s0">inhaled the air with joy.</span>

<span class="s0">It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the</span>
<span class="s0">black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky</span>
<span class="s0">did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane</span>
<span class="s0">things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been</span>
<span class="s0">raised. At the entrance to the Arbat Square an immense expanse of dark</span>
<span class="s0">starry sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it,</span>
<span class="s0">above the Prechistenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all</span>
<span class="s0">sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to</span>
<span class="s0">the earth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the</span>
<span class="s0">enormous and brilliant comet of 1812--the comet which was said to</span>
<span class="s0">portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world. In Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">however, that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling</span>
<span class="s0">of fear. On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears,</span>
<span class="s0">at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit with</span>
<span class="s0">inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly-</span>
<span class="s0">like an arrow piercing the earth--to remain fixed in a chosen spot,</span>
<span class="s0">vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and displaying its white</span>
<span class="s0">light amid countless other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own</span>
<span class="s0">softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK NINE: 1812</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating</span>
<span class="s0">of the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces-</span>
<span class="s0">millions of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army-</span>
<span class="s0">moved from the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which</span>
<span class="s0">since 1811 Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth</span>
<span class="s0">of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed to</span>
<span class="s0">human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated</span>
<span class="s0">against one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries,</span>
<span class="s0">thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms,</span>
<span class="s0">and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of</span>
<span class="s0">all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed them</span>
<span class="s0">did not at the time regard as being crimes.</span>

<span class="s0">What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes?</span>
<span class="s0">The historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the</span>
<span class="s0">wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the</span>
<span class="s0">Continental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,</span>
<span class="s0">Rumyantsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to</span>
<span class="s0">have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon to have written to Alexander: &quot;My respected Brother, I</span>
<span class="s0">consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg&quot;--and there</span>
<span class="s0">would have been no war.</span>

<span class="s0">We can understand that the matter seemed like that to</span>
<span class="s0">contemporaries. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was</span>
<span class="s0">caused by England's intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St.</span>
<span class="s0">Helena). It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that</span>
<span class="s0">the cause of the war was Napoleon's ambition; to the Duke of</span>
<span class="s0">Oldenburg, that the cause of the war was the violence done to him;</span>
<span class="s0">to businessmen that the cause of the way was the Continental System</span>
<span class="s0">which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the</span>
<span class="s0">chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them</span>
<span class="s0">employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of</span>
<span class="s0">re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that</span>
<span class="s0">time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between</span>
<span class="s0">Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed</span>
<span class="s0">from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178.</span>
<span class="s0">It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of</span>
<span class="s0">other reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points</span>
<span class="s0">of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to</span>
<span class="s0">posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and</span>
<span class="s0">perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem</span>
<span class="s0">insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of</span>
<span class="s0">Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England's policy was</span>
<span class="s0">astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what</span>
<span class="s0">connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter</span>
<span class="s0">and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men</span>
<span class="s0">from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smolensk</span>
<span class="s0">and Moscow and were killed by them.</span>

<span class="s0">To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried</span>
<span class="s0">away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event</span>
<span class="s0">with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes</span>
<span class="s0">present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes</span>
<span class="s0">the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of</span>
<span class="s0">causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by</span>
<span class="s0">its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its</span>
<span class="s0">impotence--apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident</span>
<span class="s0">causes--to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or</span>
<span class="s0">that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to</span>
<span class="s0">restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and</span>
<span class="s0">had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also</span>
<span class="s0">refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon's army and</span>
<span class="s0">the war could not have occurred.</span>

<span class="s0">Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw</span>
<span class="s0">beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would</span>
<span class="s0">have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a</span>
<span class="s0">second term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there</span>
<span class="s0">have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of</span>
<span class="s0">Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been</span>
<span class="s0">an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a</span>
<span class="s0">subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced</span>
<span class="s0">the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing</span>
<span class="s0">could have happened. So all these causes--myriads of causes--coincided</span>
<span class="s0">to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that</span>
<span class="s0">occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men,</span>
<span class="s0">renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to</span>
<span class="s0">east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes</span>
<span class="s0">of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.</span>

<span class="s0">The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier</span>
<span class="s0">who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This</span>
<span class="s0">could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried</span>
<span class="s0">out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without</span>
<span class="s0">any one of which the event could not have taken place. It was</span>
<span class="s0">necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power-</span>
<span class="s0">the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns--should</span>
<span class="s0">consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should</span>
<span class="s0">have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and</span>
<span class="s0">complex causes.</span>

<span class="s0">We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of</span>
<span class="s0">irrational events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of</span>
<span class="s0">which we do not understand). The more we try to explain such events in</span>
<span class="s0">history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they</span>
<span class="s0">become to us.</span>

<span class="s0">Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal</span>
<span class="s0">aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain</span>
<span class="s0">from doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that</span>
<span class="s0">action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and</span>
<span class="s0">belongs to history, in which it has not a free but a predestined</span>
<span class="s0">significance.</span>

<span class="s0">There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life,</span>
<span class="s0">which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his</span>
<span class="s0">elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious</span>
<span class="s0">instrument in the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of</span>
<span class="s0">humanity. A deed done is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in</span>
<span class="s0">time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic</span>
<span class="s0">significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more</span>
<span class="s0">people he is connected with and the more power he has over others, the</span>
<span class="s0">more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every</span>
<span class="s0">action.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The king's heart is in the hands of the Lord.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A king is history's slave.</span>

<span class="s0">History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind,</span>
<span class="s0">uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.</span>

<span class="s0">Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than</span>
<span class="s0">ever that it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses</span>
<span class="s0">peuples*--as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him-</span>
<span class="s0">he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which</span>
<span class="s0">compelled him, while thinking that he was acting on his own</span>
<span class="s0">volition, to perform for the hive life--that is to say, for history-</span>
<span class="s0">whatever had to be performed.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and</span>
<span class="s0">by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and</span>
<span class="s0">co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the</span>
<span class="s0">nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg's</span>
<span class="s0">wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia--undertaken (as it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace,</span>
<span class="s0">the French Emperor's love and habit of war coinciding with his</span>
<span class="s0">people's inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations,</span>
<span class="s0">and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining</span>
<span class="s0">advantages to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors</span>
<span class="s0">he received in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the</span>
<span class="s0">opinion of contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to</span>
<span class="s0">attain peace, but which only wounded the self-love of both sides,</span>
<span class="s0">and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to</span>
<span class="s0">the event that was happening or coincided with it.</span>

<span class="s0">When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of</span>
<span class="s0">its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it</span>
<span class="s0">is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes</span>
<span class="s0">it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it?</span>

<span class="s0">Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions</span>
<span class="s0">in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the</span>
<span class="s0">botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue</span>
<span class="s0">decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under</span>
<span class="s0">the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and</span>
<span class="s0">prayed for it. Equally right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">went to Moscow because he wanted to, and perished because Alexander</span>
<span class="s0">desired his destruction, and he who says that an undermined hill</span>
<span class="s0">weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for</span>
<span class="s0">the last time with his mattock. In historic events the so-called great</span>
<span class="s0">men are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but</span>
<span class="s0">the smallest connection with the event itself.</span>

<span class="s0">Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will,</span>
<span class="s0">is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole</span>
<span class="s0">course of history and predestined from eternity.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent</span>
<span class="s0">three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,</span>
<span class="s0">and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the</span>
<span class="s0">emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings</span>
<span class="s0">and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and</span>
<span class="s0">diamonds of his own--that is, which he had taken from other kings-</span>
<span class="s0">to the Empress of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us,</span>
<span class="s0">tenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise--who regarded him as her</span>
<span class="s0">husband, though he had left another wife in Paris--left her grieved by</span>
<span class="s0">the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear. Though the</span>
<span class="s0">diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and</span>
<span class="s0">worked zealously to that end, and though the Emperor Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him Monsieur mon frere,</span>
<span class="s0">and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always</span>
<span class="s0">love and honor him--yet he set off to join his army, and at every</span>
<span class="s0">station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops</span>
<span class="s0">from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses,</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to</span>
<span class="s0">Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and Konigsberg. At each of these towns thousands</span>
<span class="s0">of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.</span>

<span class="s0">The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses</span>
<span class="s0">carried him in the same direction. On the tenth of June,* coming up</span>
<span class="s0">with the army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on</span>
<span class="s0">the estate of a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.</span>


<span class="s0">*Old style.</span>


<span class="s0">Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the</span>
<span class="s0">Niemen, and, changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank</span>
<span class="s0">in order to select a place for the crossing.</span>

<span class="s0">Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the</span>
<span class="s0">wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the</span>
<span class="s0">Scythia into which Alexander the Great had marched--Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">unexpectedly, and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic</span>
<span class="s0">considerations, ordered an advance, and the next day his army began to</span>
<span class="s0">cross the Niemen.</span>

<span class="s0">Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,</span>
<span class="s0">which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and</span>
<span class="s0">looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out</span>
<span class="s0">of the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown</span>
<span class="s0">across the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor's presence,</span>
<span class="s0">were on the lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in</span>
<span class="s0">an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of</span>
<span class="s0">his tent on the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: &quot;Vive</span>
<span class="s0">l'Empereur!&quot; and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of</span>
<span class="s0">the vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and</span>
<span class="s0">on by the three bridges to the other side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now we'll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself,</span>
<span class="s0">things get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l'Empereur! So</span>
<span class="s0">these are the steppes of Asia! It's a nasty country all the same. Au</span>
<span class="s0">revoir, Beauche; I'll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au</span>
<span class="s0">revoir. Good luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l'Empereur!...</span>
<span class="s0">preur!--If they make me Governor of India, Gerard, I'll make you</span>
<span class="s0">Minister of Kashmir--that's settled. Vive l'Empereur! Hurrah!</span>
<span class="s0">hurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks--those rascals--see how they run! Vive</span>
<span class="s0">l'Empereur! There he is, do you see him? I've seen him twice, as I see</span>
<span class="s0">you now. The little corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the</span>
<span class="s0">veterans.... Vive l'Empereur!&quot; came the voices of men, old and</span>
<span class="s0">young, of most diverse characters and social positions. On the faces</span>
<span class="s0">of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the</span>
<span class="s0">long-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the</span>
<span class="s0">gray coat who was standing on the hill.</span>

<span class="s0">On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse</span>
<span class="s0">was brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one</span>
<span class="s0">of the bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant</span>
<span class="s0">and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because</span>
<span class="s0">it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of</span>
<span class="s0">him by such shouting, but the shouting which accompanied him</span>
<span class="s0">everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares</span>
<span class="s0">that had occupied him from the time he joined the army. He rode across</span>
<span class="s0">one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side, turned sharply</span>
<span class="s0">to the left, and galloped in the direction of Kovno, preceded by</span>
<span class="s0">enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard who, breathless with</span>
<span class="s0">delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops. On</span>
<span class="s0">reaching the broad river Viliya, he stopped near a regiment of</span>
<span class="s0">Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vivat!&quot; shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and</span>
<span class="s0">pressing against one another to see him.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a</span>
<span class="s0">log that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was</span>
<span class="s0">handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run</span>
<span class="s0">up to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became</span>
<span class="s0">absorbed in a map laid out on the logs. Without lifting his head he</span>
<span class="s0">said something, and two of his aides-de-camp galloped off to the</span>
<span class="s0">Polish Uhlans.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What did he say?&quot; was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans</span>
<span class="s0">when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.</span>

<span class="s0">The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel</span>
<span class="s0">of the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his</span>
<span class="s0">speech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be</span>
<span class="s0">permitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford.</span>
<span class="s0">In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on</span>
<span class="s0">a horse, he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor's eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">would not be displeased at this excess of zeal.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached</span>
<span class="s0">officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Vivat!&quot; and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse</span>
<span class="s0">and galloped into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse,</span>
<span class="s0">which had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading</span>
<span class="s0">for the deepest part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans</span>
<span class="s0">galloped in after him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in</span>
<span class="s0">the middle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as</span>
<span class="s0">they fell off their horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some</span>
<span class="s0">of the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some</span>
<span class="s0">clinging to their horses' manes. They tried to make their way</span>
<span class="s0">forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford one third of</span>
<span class="s0">a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this</span>
<span class="s0">river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even</span>
<span class="s0">looking at what they were doing. When the aide-de-camp, having</span>
<span class="s0">returned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor's attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the</span>
<span class="s0">little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned</span>
<span class="s0">Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving him</span>
<span class="s0">instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the</span>
<span class="s0">drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.</span>

<span class="s0">For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of</span>
<span class="s0">the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough</span>
<span class="s0">to dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called</span>
<span class="s0">for his horse and rode to his quarters.</span>

<span class="s0">Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were</span>
<span class="s0">sent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from</span>
<span class="s0">which they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and</span>
<span class="s0">with difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they</span>
<span class="s0">had got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Vivat!&quot; and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been</span>
<span class="s0">but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves</span>
<span class="s0">happy.</span>

<span class="s0">That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian</span>
<span class="s0">paper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as</span>
<span class="s0">quickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a</span>
<span class="s0">letter containing information about the orders to the French army</span>
<span class="s0">had been found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish</span>
<span class="s0">colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled</span>
<span class="s0">in the Legion d'honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.</span>

<span class="s0">Quos vult perdere dementat.*</span>

<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vilna for more than</span>
<span class="s0">a month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for</span>
<span class="s0">the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">had come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The</span>
<span class="s0">vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even</span>
<span class="s0">increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each</span>
<span class="s0">of the three armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no</span>
<span class="s0">supreme commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume</span>
<span class="s0">that responsibility himself.</span>

<span class="s0">The longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody-</span>
<span class="s0">tired of waiting--prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend</span>
<span class="s0">his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending.</span>

<span class="s0">In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by</span>
<span class="s0">the courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the</span>
<span class="s0">Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be</span>
<span class="s0">given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly</span>
<span class="s0">received. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected</span>
<span class="s0">money by subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a</span>
<span class="s0">landowner in the Vilna province, offered his country house for the</span>
<span class="s0">fete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner,</span>
<span class="s0">regatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen's country seat.</span>


<span class="s0">The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and</span>
<span class="s0">his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">frontier, Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by</span>
<span class="s0">his aides-de-camp at Bennigsen's country house.</span>

<span class="s0">It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters</span>
<span class="s0">declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one</span>
<span class="s0">place. Countess Bezukhova was present among other Russian ladies who</span>
<span class="s0">had followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vilna and eclipsed the</span>
<span class="s0">refined Polish ladies by her massive, so called Russian type of</span>
<span class="s0">beauty. The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris Drubetskoy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the</span>
<span class="s0">present en garcon (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not</span>
<span class="s0">an aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Boris</span>
<span class="s0">was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought</span>
<span class="s0">patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of</span>
<span class="s0">his own age. He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen</span>
<span class="s0">her for a long time and did not recall the past, but as Helene was</span>
<span class="s0">enjoying the favors of a very important personage and Boris had only</span>
<span class="s0">recently married, they met as good friends of long standing.</span>

<span class="s0">At midnight dancing was still going on. Helene, not having a</span>
<span class="s0">suitable partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Boris.</span>
<span class="s0">They were the third couple. Boris, coolly looking at Helene's dazzling</span>
<span class="s0">bare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze</span>
<span class="s0">gown, talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware</span>
<span class="s0">of it himself and unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased</span>
<span class="s0">to observe the Emperor who was in the same room. The Emperor was not</span>
<span class="s0">dancing, he stood in the doorway, stopping now one pair and now</span>
<span class="s0">another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter.</span>

<span class="s0">As the mazurka began, Boris saw that Adjutant General Balashev,</span>
<span class="s0">one of those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him</span>
<span class="s0">and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to</span>
<span class="s0">a Polish lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked</span>
<span class="s0">inquiringly at Balashev and, evidently understanding that he only</span>
<span class="s0">acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing, nodded</span>
<span class="s0">slightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly had Balashev begun to</span>
<span class="s0">speak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor's face. He</span>
<span class="s0">took Balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him,</span>
<span class="s0">unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both</span>
<span class="s0">sides made way for him. Boris noticed Arakcheev's excited face when</span>
<span class="s0">the sovereign went out with Balashev. Arakcheev looked at the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped</span>
<span class="s0">forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him.</span>
<span class="s0">(Boris understood that Arakcheev envied Balashev and was displeased</span>
<span class="s0">that evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than</span>
<span class="s0">through himself.)</span>

<span class="s0">But the Emperor and Balashev passed out into the illuminated</span>
<span class="s0">garden without noticing Arakcheev who, holding his sword and</span>
<span class="s0">glancing wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.</span>

<span class="s0">All the time Boris was going through the figures of the mazurka,</span>
<span class="s0">he was worried by the question of what news Balashev had brought and</span>
<span class="s0">how he could find it out before others. In the figure in which he</span>
<span class="s0">had to choose two ladies, he whispered to Helene that he meant to</span>
<span class="s0">choose Countess Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the</span>
<span class="s0">veranda, and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the</span>
<span class="s0">garden, where, seeing Balashev and the Emperor returning to the</span>
<span class="s0">veranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. Boris,</span>
<span class="s0">fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw, respectfully pressed</span>
<span class="s0">close to the doorpost with bowed head.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally</span>
<span class="s0">affronted, was finishing with these words:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as</span>
<span class="s0">long as a single armed enemy remains in my country!&quot; It seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">Boris that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was</span>
<span class="s0">satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but</span>
<span class="s0">displeased that Boris had overheard it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let no one know of it!&quot; the Emperor added with a frown.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris understood that this was meant for him and, closing his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and</span>
<span class="s0">remained there about another half-hour.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris was thus the first to learn the news that the French army</span>
<span class="s0">had crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain</span>
<span class="s0">important personages that much that was concealed from others was</span>
<span class="s0">usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their</span>
<span class="s0">estimation.</span>


<span class="s0">The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was</span>
<span class="s0">particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations,</span>
<span class="s0">and at a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of</span>
<span class="s0">indignation and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased</span>
<span class="s0">him, fully expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On</span>
<span class="s0">returning home at two o'clock that night he sent for his secretary,</span>
<span class="s0">Shishkov, and told him to write an order to the troops and a</span>
<span class="s0">rescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltykov, in which he insisted on the</span>
<span class="s0">words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a</span>
<span class="s0">single armed Frenchman remained on Russian soil.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:</span>


<span class="s0">Monsieur mon frere,</span>

<span class="s0">Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty which I have kept my</span>
<span class="s0">engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in</span>
<span class="s0">which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression,</span>
<span class="s0">that Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with</span>
<span class="s0">me from the time Prince Kuragin asked for his passports. The reasons</span>
<span class="s0">on which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him</span>
<span class="s0">would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a</span>
<span class="s0">pretext for aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has</span>
<span class="s0">declared, was never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I</span>
<span class="s0">was informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and</span>
<span class="s0">ordered him to remain at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend</span>
<span class="s0">to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding, and</span>
<span class="s0">consents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory, I will regard</span>
<span class="s0">what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us</span>
<span class="s0">will be possible. In the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see</span>
<span class="s0">myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked.</span>
<span class="s0">It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the</span>
<span class="s0">calamity of another war. I am, etc.,</span>
                                         <span class="s0">(signed) Alexander</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having</span>
<span class="s0">sent for Balashev and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him</span>
<span class="s0">to take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When</span>
<span class="s0">dispatching Balashev, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he</span>
<span class="s0">would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on</span>
<span class="s0">Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon.</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because</span>
<span class="s0">with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use</span>
<span class="s0">them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made,</span>
<span class="s0">but he definitely instructed Balashev to repeat them personally to</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon.</span>

<span class="s0">Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied</span>
<span class="s0">by a bugler and two Cossacks, Balashev reached the French outposts</span>
<span class="s0">at the village of Rykonty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn.</span>
<span class="s0">There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.</span>

<span class="s0">A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform</span>
<span class="s0">and a shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt.</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev did not do so at once, but continued to advance along the</span>
<span class="s0">road at a walking pace.</span>

<span class="s0">The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,</span>
<span class="s0">advanced his horse's chest against Balashev, put his hand to his</span>
<span class="s0">saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he</span>
<span class="s0">deaf that he did not do as he was told? Balashev mentioned who he was.</span>
<span class="s0">The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about</span>
<span class="s0">regimental matters without looking at the Russian general.</span>

<span class="s0">After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after</span>
<span class="s0">conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in</span>
<span class="s0">general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the</span>
<span class="s0">service, Balashev found it very strange here on Russian soil to</span>
<span class="s0">encounter this hostile, and still more this disrespectful, application</span>
<span class="s0">of brute force to himself.</span>

<span class="s0">The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air</span>
<span class="s0">was fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road</span>
<span class="s0">from the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one</span>
<span class="s0">after another, like bubbles rising in water.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer</span>
<span class="s0">from the village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French</span>
<span class="s0">hussars looked silently at one another from time to time.</span>

<span class="s0">A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed,</span>
<span class="s0">came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse,</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their</span>
<span class="s0">horses all looked smart and well kept.</span>

<span class="s0">It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full</span>
<span class="s0">trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of</span>
<span class="s0">martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit</span>
<span class="s0">of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.</span>

<span class="s0">The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was</span>
<span class="s0">polite and evidently understood Balashev's importance. He led him past</span>
<span class="s0">his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to</span>
<span class="s0">be presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied</span>
<span class="s0">immediately, as the Emperor's quarters were, he believed, not far off.</span>

<span class="s0">They rode through the village of Rykonty, past tethered French</span>
<span class="s0">hussar horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and</span>
<span class="s0">stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the</span>
<span class="s0">other end of the village. The colonel said that the commander of the</span>
<span class="s0">division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashev</span>
<span class="s0">and conduct him to his destination.</span>

<span class="s0">The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.</span>

<span class="s0">They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a</span>
<span class="s0">group of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a</span>
<span class="s0">black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall</span>
<span class="s0">man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders. He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long legs forward</span>
<span class="s0">in French fashion. This man rode toward Balashev at a gallop, his</span>
<span class="s0">plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright</span>
<span class="s0">June sunshine.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev was only two horses' length from the equestrian with the</span>
<span class="s0">bracelets, plunies, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was</span>
<span class="s0">galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when</span>
<span class="s0">Julner, the French colonel, whispered respectfully: &quot;The King of</span>
<span class="s0">Naples!&quot; It was, in fact, Murat, now called &quot;King of Naples.&quot; Though</span>
<span class="s0">it was quite incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he</span>
<span class="s0">was called so, and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly. He was so</span>
<span class="s0">sure that he really was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of</span>
<span class="s0">his departure from that city, while walking through the streets with</span>
<span class="s0">his wife, some Italians called out to him: &quot;Viva il re!&quot;* he turned to</span>
<span class="s0">his wife with a pensive smile and said: &quot;Poor fellows, they don't know</span>
<span class="s0">that I am leaving them tomorrow!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Long live the king.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and</span>
<span class="s0">pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly,</span>
<span class="s0">after he had been ordered to return to military service--and</span>
<span class="s0">especially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when</span>
<span class="s0">his august brother-in-law had told him: &quot;I made you King that you</span>
<span class="s0">should reign in my way, but not in yours!&quot;--he had cheerfully taken up</span>
<span class="s0">his familiar business, and--like a well-fed but not overfat horse that</span>
<span class="s0">feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts--he</span>
<span class="s0">dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible, and</span>
<span class="s0">gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of Poland, without</span>
<span class="s0">himself knowing why or whither.</span>

<span class="s0">On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its</span>
<span class="s0">long hair curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner,</span>
<span class="s0">and looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully</span>
<span class="s0">informed His Majesty of Balashev's mission, whose name he could not</span>
<span class="s0">pronounce.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;De Bal-macheve!&quot; said the King (overcoming by his assurance the</span>
<span class="s0">difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). &quot;Charmed to make</span>
<span class="s0">your acquaintance, General!&quot; he added, with a gesture of kingly</span>
<span class="s0">condescension.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity</span>
<span class="s0">instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his</span>
<span class="s0">natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the</span>
<span class="s0">withers of Balashev's horse and said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, General, it all looks like war,&quot; as if regretting a</span>
<span class="s0">circumstance of which he was unable to judge.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; replied Balashev, &quot;my master, the Emperor, does</span>
<span class="s0">not desire war and as Your Majesty sees...&quot; said Balashev, using the</span>
<span class="s0">words Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation</span>
<span class="s0">unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a</span>
<span class="s0">novelty.</span>

<span class="s0">Murat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Monsieur de Bal-macheve.&quot; But royaute oblige!* and he felt it</span>
<span class="s0">incumbent on him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs</span>
<span class="s0">with Alexander's envoy. He dismounted, took Balashev's arm, and moving</span>
<span class="s0">a few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to</span>
<span class="s0">pace up and down with him, trying to speak significantly. He</span>
<span class="s0">referred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand</span>
<span class="s0">that he should withdraw his troops from Prussia, especially when</span>
<span class="s0">that demand became generally known and the dignity of France was</span>
<span class="s0">thereby offended.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Royalty has its obligations.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Balashev replied that there was &quot;nothing offensive in the demand,</span>
<span class="s0">because...&quot; but Murat interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then you don't consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">asked unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of</span>
<span class="s0">the war.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, my dear general!&quot; Murat again interrupted him, &quot;with all my</span>
<span class="s0">heart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and</span>
<span class="s0">that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as</span>
<span class="s0">possible!&quot; said he, in the tone of a servant who wants to remain</span>
<span class="s0">good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters.</span>

<span class="s0">And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of</span>
<span class="s0">his health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had</span>
<span class="s0">spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal</span>
<span class="s0">dignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which</span>
<span class="s0">he had stood at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I won't detain you longer, General. I wish success to your</span>
<span class="s0">mission,&quot; and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers,</span>
<span class="s0">and his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were</span>
<span class="s0">respectfully awaiting him.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev rode on, supposing from Murat's words that he would very</span>
<span class="s0">soon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the</span>
<span class="s0">next village the sentinels of Davout's infantry corps detained him</span>
<span class="s0">as the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the</span>
<span class="s0">corps commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to</span>
<span class="s0">Marshal Davout.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">Davout was to Napoleon what Arakcheev was to Alexander--though not a</span>
<span class="s0">coward like Arakcheev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to</span>
<span class="s0">express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.</span>

<span class="s0">In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are</span>
<span class="s0">necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always</span>
<span class="s0">appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and</span>
<span class="s0">their proximity to the head of the government may be. This</span>
<span class="s0">inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakcheev, who tore</span>
<span class="s0">out a grenadier's mustache with his own hands, whose weak nerves</span>
<span class="s0">rendered him unable to face danger, and who was neither an educated</span>
<span class="s0">man nor a courtier, was able to maintain his powerful position with</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander, whose own character was chivalrous, noble, and gentle.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a</span>
<span class="s0">peasant's hut, writing--he was auditing accounts. Better quarters</span>
<span class="s0">could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who</span>
<span class="s0">purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a</span>
<span class="s0">justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they are always</span>
<span class="s0">hard at work and in a hurry. &quot;How can I think of the bright side of</span>
<span class="s0">life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty</span>
<span class="s0">shed?&quot; the expression of his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure</span>
<span class="s0">and necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows</span>
<span class="s0">animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity.</span>
<span class="s0">Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashev was brought in.</span>
<span class="s0">He became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian general</span>
<span class="s0">entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at Balashev's face,</span>
<span class="s0">which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with</span>
<span class="s0">Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and</span>
<span class="s0">sneered malevolently.</span>

<span class="s0">When he noticed in Balashev's face the disagreeable impression</span>
<span class="s0">this reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked</span>
<span class="s0">what he wanted.</span>

<span class="s0">Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because</span>
<span class="s0">Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashev hastened to</span>
<span class="s0">inform him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation,</span>
<span class="s0">Davout, after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is your dispatch?&quot; he inquired. &quot;Give it to me. I will send</span>
<span class="s0">it to the Emperor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your Emperor's orders are obeyed in your army, but here,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Davout, &quot;you must do as you're told.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his</span>
<span class="s0">dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer</span>
<span class="s0">on duty.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev took out the packet containing the Emperor's letter and</span>
<span class="s0">laid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging</span>
<span class="s0">on it, laid across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the</span>
<span class="s0">inscription.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">protested Balashev, &quot;but permit me to observe that I have the honor to</span>
<span class="s0">be adjutant general to His Majesty....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the</span>
<span class="s0">signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashev's face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You will be treated as is fitting,&quot; said he and, putting the packet</span>
<span class="s0">in his pocket, left the shed.</span>

<span class="s0">A minute later the marshal's adjutant, de Castres, came in and</span>
<span class="s0">conducted Balashev to the quarters assigned him.</span>

<span class="s0">That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the</span>
<span class="s0">barrels.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashev to come to</span>
<span class="s0">him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the</span>
<span class="s0">baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one</span>
<span class="s0">except Monsieur de Castres.</span>

<span class="s0">After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his</span>
<span class="s0">impotence and insignificance--particularly acute by contrast with</span>
<span class="s0">the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved--and after several</span>
<span class="s0">marches with the marshal's baggage and the French army, which occupied</span>
<span class="s0">the whole district, Balashev was brought to Vilna--now occupied by the</span>
<span class="s0">French--through the very gate by which he had left it four days</span>
<span class="s0">previously.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne,</span>
<span class="s0">came to Balashev and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon's wish to</span>
<span class="s0">honor him with an audience.</span>

<span class="s0">Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment had</span>
<span class="s0">stood in front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, and now</span>
<span class="s0">two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front</span>
<span class="s0">and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and</span>
<span class="s0">Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals,</span>
<span class="s0">who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch,</span>
<span class="s0">round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev in the very house in Vilna from which Alexander had</span>
<span class="s0">dispatched him on his mission.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">Though Balashev was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the</span>
<span class="s0">luxury and magnificence of Napoleon's court.</span>

<span class="s0">The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many</span>
<span class="s0">generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates--several of whom</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia--were waiting.</span>
<span class="s0">Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before</span>
<span class="s0">going for his ride.</span>

<span class="s0">After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came</span>
<span class="s0">into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashev</span>
<span class="s0">to follow him.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev went into a small reception room, one door of which led</span>
<span class="s0">into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had</span>
<span class="s0">dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He</span>
<span class="s0">heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of</span>
<span class="s0">other steps, firm and resolute--they were those of Napoleon. He had</span>
<span class="s0">just finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform,</span>
<span class="s0">opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his</span>
<span class="s0">rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat</span>
<span class="s0">thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had</span>
<span class="s0">evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of</span>
<span class="s0">his broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the</span>
<span class="s0">black collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His</span>
<span class="s0">full face, rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a</span>
<span class="s0">gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome.</span>

<span class="s0">He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head</span>
<span class="s0">slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad</span>
<span class="s0">thick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had</span>
<span class="s0">that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live</span>
<span class="s0">in comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits</span>
<span class="s0">that day.</span>

<span class="s0">He nodded in answer to Balashav's low and respectful bow, and coming</span>
<span class="s0">up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of</span>
<span class="s0">his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but</span>
<span class="s0">is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good day, General!&quot; said he. &quot;I have received the letter you</span>
<span class="s0">brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.&quot; He</span>
<span class="s0">glanced with his large eyes into Balashav's face and immediately</span>
<span class="s0">looked past him.</span>

<span class="s0">It was plain that Balashev's personality did not interest him at</span>
<span class="s0">all. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested</span>
<span class="s0">him. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because</span>
<span class="s0">everything in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his</span>
<span class="s0">will.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I do not, and did not, desire war,&quot; he continued, &quot;but it has</span>
<span class="s0">been forced on me. Even now&quot; (he emphasized the word) &quot;I am ready to</span>
<span class="s0">receive any explanations you can give me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly</span>
<span class="s0">moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev</span>
<span class="s0">was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter</span>
<span class="s0">into negotiations.</span>

<span class="s0">When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian envoy, Balashev began a speech he had prepared long before:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Sire! The Emperor, my master...&quot; but the sight of the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">eyes bent on him confused him. &quot;You are flurried--compose yourself!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked</span>
<span class="s0">at Balashev's uniform and sword.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin's demand for his</span>
<span class="s0">passports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on his</span>
<span class="s0">own initiative and without his sovereign's assent, that the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with England.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not yet!&quot; interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to</span>
<span class="s0">his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev</span>
<span class="s0">might proceed.</span>

<span class="s0">After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashev added</span>
<span class="s0">that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter</span>
<span class="s0">into negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashev hesitated:</span>
<span class="s0">he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his</span>
<span class="s0">letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov and had</span>
<span class="s0">told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered these</span>
<span class="s0">words, &quot;So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,&quot; but</span>
<span class="s0">some complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though</span>
<span class="s0">he wished to do so. He grew confused and said: &quot;On condition that</span>
<span class="s0">the French army retires beyond the Niemen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon noticed Balashev's embarrassment when uttering these last</span>
<span class="s0">words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to</span>
<span class="s0">quiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began</span>
<span class="s0">speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the</span>
<span class="s0">speech that followed, Balashev, who more than once lowered his eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon's left leg which</span>
<span class="s0">increased the more Napoleon raised his voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,&quot; he began.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it?</span>
<span class="s0">I have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to</span>
<span class="s0">begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?&quot; he said, frowning and</span>
<span class="s0">making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump</span>
<span class="s0">hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Niemen?&quot; repeated Napoleon. &quot;So now you want me to retire</span>
<span class="s0">beyond the Niemen--only the Niemen?&quot; repeated Napoleon, looking</span>
<span class="s0">straight at Balashev.</span>

<span class="s0">The latter bowed his head respectfully.</span>

<span class="s0">Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from</span>
<span class="s0">Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen</span>
<span class="s0">before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months</span>
<span class="s0">ago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the</span>
<span class="s0">Oder, and yet you are willing to negotiate.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and</span>
<span class="s0">again stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev noticed that his left leg</span>
<span class="s0">was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in</span>
<span class="s0">its stern expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon was conscious of. &quot;The vibration of my left calf is a great</span>
<span class="s0">sign with me,&quot; he remarked at a later date.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be</span>
<span class="s0">made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!&quot; Napoleon almost screamed,</span>
<span class="s0">quite to his own surprise. &quot;If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I</span>
<span class="s0">could not accept such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But</span>
<span class="s0">who first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer</span>
<span class="s0">me negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in</span>
<span class="s0">alliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You</span>
<span class="s0">offer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with</span>
<span class="s0">England? What has she given you?&quot; he continued hurriedly, evidently no</span>
<span class="s0">longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its</span>
<span class="s0">possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander's errors and duplicity.</span>

<span class="s0">The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the</span>
<span class="s0">intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and</span>
<span class="s0">showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had</span>
<span class="s0">begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his</span>
<span class="s0">words.</span>

<span class="s0">The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt</span>
<span class="s0">himself and insult Alexander--just what he had least desired at the</span>
<span class="s0">commencement of the interview.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I hear you have made peace with Turkey?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev bowed his head affirmatively.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Peace has been concluded...&quot; he began.</span>

<span class="s0">But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all</span>
<span class="s0">the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of</span>
<span class="s0">eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so</span>
<span class="s0">prone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining</span>
<span class="s0">Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those</span>
<span class="s0">provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,&quot; he went on, &quot;I promised and</span>
<span class="s0">would have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now</span>
<span class="s0">he won't have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united</span>
<span class="s0">them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia</span>
<span class="s0">from the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the</span>
<span class="s0">Great could not have done more,&quot; said Napoleon, growing more and</span>
<span class="s0">more excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashev</span>
<span class="s0">almost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. &quot;All</span>
<span class="s0">that, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold</span>
<span class="s0">snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander's might have been!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the latter</span>
<span class="s0">tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained</span>
<span class="s0">through my friendship?&quot; demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders</span>
<span class="s0">in perplexity. &quot;But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my</span>
<span class="s0">enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and</span>
<span class="s0">Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;</span>
<span class="s0">Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French</span>
<span class="s0">subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but</span>
<span class="s0">all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807</span>
<span class="s0">and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander's</span>
<span class="s0">mind.... Granted that were they competent they might be made use</span>
<span class="s0">of,&quot; continued Napoleon--hardly able to keep pace in words with the</span>
<span class="s0">rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and</span>
<span class="s0">strong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)-</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;but they are not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace!</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay is said to be the most capable of them all, but I cannot say</span>
<span class="s0">so, judging by his first movements. And what are they doing, all these</span>
<span class="s0">courtiers? Pfuel proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay, called on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time</span>
<span class="s0">passes bringing no result. Bagration alone is a military man. He's</span>
<span class="s0">stupid, but he has experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And</span>
<span class="s0">what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd?</span>
<span class="s0">They compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that</span>
<span class="s0">happens. A sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a</span>
<span class="s0">general!&quot; said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words as a direct</span>
<span class="s0">challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired to be a</span>
<span class="s0">military commander.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven't even been</span>
<span class="s0">able to defend Vilna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of</span>
<span class="s0">the Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary, Your Majesty,&quot; said Balashev, hardly able to</span>
<span class="s0">remember what had been said to him and following these verbal</span>
<span class="s0">fireworks with difficulty, &quot;the troops are burning with eagerness...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know everything!&quot; Napoleon interrupted him. &quot;I know everything. I</span>
<span class="s0">know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You</span>
<span class="s0">have not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number.</span>
<span class="s0">I give you my word of honor,&quot; said Napoleon, forgetting that his</span>
<span class="s0">word of honor could carry no weight--&quot;I give you my word of honor that</span>
<span class="s0">I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the</span>
<span class="s0">Vistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing</span>
<span class="s0">and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes--it is</span>
<span class="s0">their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they</span>
<span class="s0">changed him for another--Bernadotte, who promptly went mad--for no</span>
<span class="s0">Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his</span>
<span class="s0">nose.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon's remarks, and</span>
<span class="s0">would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing</span>
<span class="s0">to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the</span>
<span class="s0">alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply that when</span>
<span class="s0">Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that</span>
<span class="s0">state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk,</span>
<span class="s0">merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balashev began</span>
<span class="s0">to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and</span>
<span class="s0">felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the</span>
<span class="s0">transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He</span>
<span class="s0">knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any</span>
<span class="s0">significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them</span>
<span class="s0">when he came to his senses. Balashev stood with downcast eyes, looking</span>
<span class="s0">at the movements of Napoleon's stout legs and trying to avoid</span>
<span class="s0">meeting his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what do I care about your allies?&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;I have</span>
<span class="s0">allies--the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight</span>
<span class="s0">like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered</span>
<span class="s0">this obvious falsehood, and that Balashev still stood silently</span>
<span class="s0">before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">abruptly turned round, drew close to Balashev's face, and,</span>
<span class="s0">gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost</span>
<span class="s0">shouted:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I'll wipe it off the</span>
<span class="s0">map of Europe!&quot; he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and</span>
<span class="s0">he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. &quot;Yes, I</span>
<span class="s0">will throw you back beyond the Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and</span>
<span class="s0">will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind</span>
<span class="s0">of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to</span>
<span class="s0">you. That is what you have gained by alienating me!&quot; And he walked</span>
<span class="s0">silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders</span>
<span class="s0">twitching.</span>

<span class="s0">He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again,</span>
<span class="s0">lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashev.</span>
<span class="s0">He paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev's eyes, and said</span>
<span class="s0">in a quiet voice:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not</span>
<span class="s0">listening to him. Balashev said that in Russia the best results were</span>
<span class="s0">expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to</span>
<span class="s0">say, &quot;I know it's your duty to say that, but you don't believe it</span>
<span class="s0">yourself. I have convinced you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox,</span>
<span class="s0">sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal.</span>
<span class="s0">The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully,</span>
<span class="s0">handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket</span>
<span class="s0">handkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,&quot; said he, taking his hat,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;that I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very</span>
<span class="s0">highly esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer,</span>
<span class="s0">General; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception</span>
<span class="s0">room rushed forward and descended the staircase.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">After all that Napoleon had said to him--those bursts of anger and</span>
<span class="s0">the last dryly spoken words: &quot;I will detain you no longer, General;</span>
<span class="s0">you shall receive my letter,&quot; Balashev felt convinced that Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with</span>
<span class="s0">him--an insulted envoy--especially as he had witnessed his unseemly</span>
<span class="s0">anger. But, to his surprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an</span>
<span class="s0">invitation to dine with the Emperor that day.</span>

<span class="s0">Bessieres, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon met Balashev cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed</span>
<span class="s0">no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that</span>
<span class="s0">morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashev. It was</span>
<span class="s0">evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him</span>
<span class="s0">to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was</span>
<span class="s0">right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but</span>
<span class="s0">because he did it.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vilna,</span>
<span class="s0">where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him.</span>
<span class="s0">From all the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs,</span>
<span class="s0">flags, and his monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies,</span>
<span class="s0">welcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner, having placed Balashev beside him, Napoleon not only</span>
<span class="s0">treated him amiably but behaved as if Balashev were one of his own</span>
<span class="s0">courtiers, one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to</span>
<span class="s0">rejoice at his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and questioned Balashev about the Russian capital, not merely</span>
<span class="s0">as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit,</span>
<span class="s0">but as if convinced that Balashev, as a Russian, must be flattered</span>
<span class="s0">by his curiosity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it</span>
<span class="s0">true that Moscow is called 'Holy Moscow'? How many churches are</span>
<span class="s0">there in Moscow?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred</span>
<span class="s0">churches, he remarked:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why such a quantity of churches?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Russians are very devout,&quot; replied Balashev.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign</span>
<span class="s0">of the backwardness of a people,&quot; said Napoleon, turning to</span>
<span class="s0">Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Every country has its own character,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,&quot; said Napoleon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I beg your Majesty's pardon,&quot; returned Balashev, &quot;besides Russia</span>
<span class="s0">there is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">This reply of Balashev's, which hinted at the recent defeats of</span>
<span class="s0">the French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander's court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">dinner, where it passed unnoticed.</span>

<span class="s0">The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that</span>
<span class="s0">they were puzzled as to what Balashev's tone suggested. &quot;If there is a</span>
<span class="s0">point we don't see it, or it is not at all witty,&quot; their expressions</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">did not notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns</span>
<span class="s0">the direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashev, who was on</span>
<span class="s0">the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as &quot;all roads lead</span>
<span class="s0">to Rome,&quot; so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;among them the road through Poltava, which Charles XII chose.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this</span>
<span class="s0">reply, but hardly had he uttered the word Poltava before</span>
<span class="s0">Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg</span>
<span class="s0">to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.</span>

<span class="s0">After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon's study, which</span>
<span class="s0">four days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon sat down, toying with his Sevres coffee cup, and motioned</span>
<span class="s0">Balashev to a chair beside him.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than</span>
<span class="s0">any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to</span>
<span class="s0">consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after</span>
<span class="s0">his dinner, Balashev too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned</span>
<span class="s0">to him with a pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied?</span>
<span class="s0">Strange, isn't it, General?&quot; he said, evidently not doubting that this</span>
<span class="s0">remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's, superiority to Alexander.</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were</span>
<span class="s0">deliberating,&quot; continued Napoleon with the same derisive and</span>
<span class="s0">self-confident smile. &quot;What I can't understand,&quot; he went on, &quot;is</span>
<span class="s0">that the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal</span>
<span class="s0">enemies. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may</span>
<span class="s0">the same?&quot; and he turned inquiringly to Balashev, and evidently this</span>
<span class="s0">thought turned him back on to the track of his morning's anger,</span>
<span class="s0">which was still fresh in him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And let him know that I will do so!&quot; said Napoleon, rising and</span>
<span class="s0">pushing his cup away with his hand. &quot;I'll drive all his Wurttemberg,</span>
<span class="s0">Baden, and Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I'll drive them</span>
<span class="s0">out. Let him prepare an asylum for them in Russia!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to</span>
<span class="s0">make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help</span>
<span class="s0">hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;</span>
<span class="s0">he treated Balashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now</span>
<span class="s0">fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master's</span>
<span class="s0">humiliation.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What</span>
<span class="s0">is the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to</span>
<span class="s0">reign and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a</span>
<span class="s0">responsibility?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up</span>
<span class="s0">and down the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly,</span>
<span class="s0">went up to Balashev and with a slight smile, as confidently,</span>
<span class="s0">quickly, and simply as if he were doing something not merely</span>
<span class="s0">important but pleasing to Balashev, he raised his hand to the</span>
<span class="s0">forty-year-old Russian general's face and, taking him by the ear,</span>
<span class="s0">pulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.</span>

<span class="s0">To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the</span>
<span class="s0">greatest honor and mark of favor at the French court.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don't you</span>
<span class="s0">say anything?&quot; said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to</span>
<span class="s0">be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. &quot;Are the</span>
<span class="s0">horses ready for the general?&quot; he added, with a slight inclination</span>
<span class="s0">of his head in reply to Balashev's bow. &quot;Let him have mine, he has a</span>
<span class="s0">long way to go!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon sent to</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander. Every detail of the interview was communicated to the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian monarch, and the war began...</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet</span>
<span class="s0">Anatole Kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had already left the</span>
<span class="s0">city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on</span>
<span class="s0">his track. Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the</span>
<span class="s0">Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov, his former commander who was</span>
<span class="s0">always well disposed toward him, and Kutuzov suggested that he</span>
<span class="s0">should accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general</span>
<span class="s0">had been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having</span>
<span class="s0">received an appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge</span>
<span class="s0">Kuragin. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause</span>
<span class="s0">it might compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he wanted to</span>
<span class="s0">meet Kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel.</span>
<span class="s0">But he again failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey, for soon after Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. In a new country,</span>
<span class="s0">amid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After</span>
<span class="s0">his betrothed had broken faith with him--which he felt the more</span>
<span class="s0">acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects--the surroundings</span>
<span class="s0">in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and</span>
<span class="s0">independence he had once prized so highly were still more so. Not only</span>
<span class="s0">could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he</span>
<span class="s0">lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later</span>
<span class="s0">enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to</span>
<span class="s0">recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had</span>
<span class="s0">revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters</span>
<span class="s0">unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more</span>
<span class="s0">eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if</span>
<span class="s0">that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above</span>
<span class="s0">him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down,</span>
<span class="s0">in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.</span>

<span class="s0">Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was</span>
<span class="s0">the simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">staff, he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and</span>
<span class="s0">surprised Kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not</span>
<span class="s0">having found Kuragin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same he knew</span>
<span class="s0">that however long it might be before he met Kuragin, despite his</span>
<span class="s0">contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince</span>
<span class="s0">himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him--he knew</span>
<span class="s0">that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him</span>
<span class="s0">out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food. And</span>
<span class="s0">the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor</span>
<span class="s0">was still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial</span>
<span class="s0">tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of</span>
<span class="s0">restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.</span>

<span class="s0">In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached</span>
<span class="s0">Bucharest--where Kutuzov had been living for two months, passing his</span>
<span class="s0">days and nights with a Wallachian woman--Prince Andrew asked Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who was already weary of</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski's activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very</span>
<span class="s0">readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.</span>

<span class="s0">Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped</span>
<span class="s0">at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on</span>
<span class="s0">his way, being only two miles off the Smolensk highroad. During the</span>
<span class="s0">last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had</span>
<span class="s0">thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east</span>
<span class="s0">and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange</span>
<span class="s0">and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the</span>
<span class="s0">same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone</span>
<span class="s0">pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were</span>
<span class="s0">entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness,</span>
<span class="s0">the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside</span>
<span class="s0">there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and</span>
<span class="s0">the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the</span>
<span class="s0">same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and</span>
<span class="s0">joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant</span>
<span class="s0">suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish,</span>
<span class="s0">self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full</span>
<span class="s0">of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more</span>
<span class="s0">self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had</span>
<span class="s0">brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and</span>
<span class="s0">talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same</span>
<span class="s0">narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old</span>
<span class="s0">prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which</span>
<span class="s0">left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was</span>
<span class="s0">the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and</span>
<span class="s0">skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">alone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair,</span>
<span class="s0">and, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip</span>
<span class="s0">of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do.</span>
<span class="s0">He alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted,</span>
<span class="s0">sleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the</span>
<span class="s0">inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">had seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and</span>
<span class="s0">hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met</span>
<span class="s0">because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince,</span>
<span class="s0">Madmoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.</span>

<span class="s0">During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but</span>
<span class="s0">they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for</span>
<span class="s0">whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them</span>
<span class="s0">all feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first</span>
<span class="s0">day, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became</span>
<span class="s0">morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner.</span>
<span class="s0">In the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse</span>
<span class="s0">him, began to tell him of the young Count Kamensky's campaign, the old</span>
<span class="s0">prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for</span>
<span class="s0">her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he</span>
<span class="s0">said, was the only person really attached to him.</span>

<span class="s0">The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and</span>
<span class="s0">that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter</span>
<span class="s0">and that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not</span>
<span class="s0">help tormenting her and that she deserved it. &quot;Why does Prince Andrew,</span>
<span class="s0">who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me</span>
<span class="s0">a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own</span>
<span class="s0">daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He</span>
<span class="s0">doesn't understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">thought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put</span>
<span class="s0">up with his daughter's unreasonable character.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If you ask me,&quot; said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was</span>
<span class="s0">censuring his father for the first time in his life), &quot;I did not</span>
<span class="s0">wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank</span>
<span class="s0">opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you</span>
<span class="s0">and Mary, I can't blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and</span>
<span class="s0">respects you. Since you ask me,&quot; continued Prince Andrew, becoming</span>
<span class="s0">irritable--as he was always liable to do of late--&quot;I can only say that</span>
<span class="s0">if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless</span>
<span class="s0">woman, who is not fit to be my sister's companion.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural</span>
<span class="s0">smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">could not get accustomed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You've already been talking it</span>
<span class="s0">over! Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Father, I did not want to judge,&quot; said Prince Andrew, in a hard and</span>
<span class="s0">bitter tone, &quot;but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall</span>
<span class="s0">say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame--the one to</span>
<span class="s0">blame--is that Frenchwoman.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!&quot; said the old man</span>
<span class="s0">in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some</span>
<span class="s0">embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: &quot;Be off, be</span>
<span class="s0">off! Let not a trace of you remain here!...&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded</span>
<span class="s0">him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did</span>
<span class="s0">not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne</span>
<span class="s0">and Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next</span>
<span class="s0">day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son's rooms. The boy,</span>
<span class="s0">curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,</span>
<span class="s0">and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell</span>
<span class="s0">into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this</span>
<span class="s0">pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He</span>
<span class="s0">sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or</span>
<span class="s0">regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms</span>
<span class="s0">with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more</span>
<span class="s0">to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former</span>
<span class="s0">tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the</span>
<span class="s0">boy and taking him on his knee.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, go on!&quot; said his son.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went</span>
<span class="s0">out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and</span>
<span class="s0">especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he</span>
<span class="s0">had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former</span>
<span class="s0">intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find</span>
<span class="s0">some work as soon as possible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you've decided to go, Andrew?&quot; asked his sister.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thank God that I can,&quot; replied Prince Andrew. &quot;I am very sorry</span>
<span class="s0">you can't.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; replied Princess Mary. &quot;Why do you say</span>
<span class="s0">that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about you....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her</span>
<span class="s0">tears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the</span>
<span class="s0">room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what--what trash--can</span>
<span class="s0">cause people misery!&quot; he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">She understood that when speaking of &quot;trash&quot; he referred not only to</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man</span>
<span class="s0">who had ruined his own happiness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!&quot; she said, touching</span>
<span class="s0">his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I understand you&quot; (she looked down). &quot;Don't imagine that sorrow is</span>
<span class="s0">the work of men. Men are His tools.&quot; She looked a little above</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's head with the confident, accustomed look with which</span>
<span class="s0">one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. &quot;Sorrow is</span>
<span class="s0">sent by Him, not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to</span>
<span class="s0">blame. If you think someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We</span>
<span class="s0">have no right to punish. And then you will know the happiness of</span>
<span class="s0">forgiving.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman's virtue.</span>
<span class="s0">But a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,&quot; he replied, and</span>
<span class="s0">though till that moment he had not been thinking of Kuragin, all his</span>
<span class="s0">unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If Mary is already persuading me forgive, it means that I ought</span>
<span class="s0">long ago to have punished him,&quot; he thought. And giving her no</span>
<span class="s0">further reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he</span>
<span class="s0">would meet Kuragin who he knew was now in the army.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she</span>
<span class="s0">knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being</span>
<span class="s0">reconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably</span>
<span class="s0">soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his</span>
<span class="s0">father, but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their</span>
<span class="s0">differences would become.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men</span>
<span class="s0">are never to blame,&quot; were the last words he heard from his sister when</span>
<span class="s0">he took leave of her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then it must be so!&quot; thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the</span>
<span class="s0">avenue from the house at Bald Hills. &quot;She, poor innocent creature,</span>
<span class="s0">is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits.</span>
<span class="s0">The old man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is</span>
<span class="s0">growing up and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he</span>
<span class="s0">will deceive or be deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself</span>
<span class="s0">don't know. I want to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give</span>
<span class="s0">him a chance to kill and laugh at me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they</span>
<span class="s0">were all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only</span>
<span class="s0">senseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after</span>
<span class="s0">another to Prince Andrew's mind.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the</span>
<span class="s0">end of June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied</span>
<span class="s0">the fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying</span>
<span class="s0">to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be</span>
<span class="s0">cut off by large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the</span>
<span class="s0">general course of affairs in the Russian army, but no one</span>
<span class="s0">anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces, and no</span>
<span class="s0">one thought the war would extend farther than the western, the Polish,</span>
<span class="s0">provinces.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been</span>
<span class="s0">assigned, on the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or</span>
<span class="s0">large village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of</span>
<span class="s0">generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best</span>
<span class="s0">houses of the villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of</span>
<span class="s0">six miles. Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor. He received Bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him</span>
<span class="s0">in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the Emperor for a</span>
<span class="s0">decision as to his employment, but asked him meanwhile to remain on</span>
<span class="s0">his staff. Anatole Kuragin, whom Prince Andrew had hoped to find</span>
<span class="s0">with the army, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg, but Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind was occupied by the interests</span>
<span class="s0">of the center that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad to</span>
<span class="s0">be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of</span>
<span class="s0">Kuragin. During the first four days, while no duties were required</span>
<span class="s0">of him, Prince Andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by</span>
<span class="s0">the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to</span>
<span class="s0">form a definite opinion about it. But the question whether the camp</span>
<span class="s0">was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided.</span>
<span class="s0">Already from his military experience and what he had seen in the</span>
<span class="s0">Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in war the</span>
<span class="s0">most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends</span>
<span class="s0">on the way unexpected movements of the enemy--that cannot be foreseen-</span>
<span class="s0">are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled. To</span>
<span class="s0">clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his</span>
<span class="s0">position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the</span>
<span class="s0">control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he</span>
<span class="s0">deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs.</span>

<span class="s0">While the Emperor had still been at Vilna, the forces had been</span>
<span class="s0">divided into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly,</span>
<span class="s0">secondly, the army under Bagration, and thirdly, the one commanded</span>
<span class="s0">by Tormasov. The Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander</span>
<span class="s0">in chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">would take command, but only that he would be with the army. The</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, moreover, had with him not a commander in chief's staff but</span>
<span class="s0">the imperial headquarters staff. In attendance on him was the head</span>
<span class="s0">of the imperial staff, Quartermaster General Prince Volkonski, as well</span>
<span class="s0">as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large</span>
<span class="s0">number of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides these, there</span>
<span class="s0">were in attendance on the Emperor without any definite appointments:</span>
<span class="s0">Arakcheev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general</span>
<span class="s0">in rank; the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich; Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rumyantsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister;</span>
<span class="s0">Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of</span>
<span class="s0">campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinian emigre;</span>
<span class="s0">Wolzogen--and many others. Though these men had no military</span>
<span class="s0">appointment in the army, their position gave them influence, and often</span>
<span class="s0">a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not know in</span>
<span class="s0">what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,</span>
<span class="s0">Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonski, or was given this or that advice and</span>
<span class="s0">did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice</span>
<span class="s0">emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it</span>
<span class="s0">had to be executed or not. But this was only the external condition;</span>
<span class="s0">the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all</span>
<span class="s0">these people, from a courtier's point of view (and in an Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">vicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this:</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but</span>
<span class="s0">disposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants.</span>
<span class="s0">Arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the</span>
<span class="s0">sovereign's bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna</span>
<span class="s0">province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district, but</span>
<span class="s0">was in reality a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at</span>
<span class="s0">hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited</span>
<span class="s0">him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was</span>
<span class="s0">useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally.</span>
<span class="s0">Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of</span>
<span class="s0">self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.</span>
<span class="s0">Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The</span>
<span class="s0">adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn</span>
<span class="s0">up the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander</span>
<span class="s0">to believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole</span>
<span class="s0">business of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel's</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a</span>
<span class="s0">harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising</span>
<span class="s0">everyone else) was able to do.</span>

<span class="s0">Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and</span>
<span class="s0">unexpected ideas every day--especially the foreigners, who did so with</span>
<span class="s0">a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their</span>
<span class="s0">own--there were many secondary personages accompanying the army</span>
<span class="s0">because their principals were there.</span>

<span class="s0">Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless,</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant, and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following</span>
<span class="s0">sharply defined subdivisions of and parties:</span>

<span class="s0">The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents--military</span>
<span class="s0">theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws--laws</span>
<span class="s0">of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his</span>
<span class="s0">adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in</span>
<span class="s0">accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and</span>
<span class="s0">they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every</span>
<span class="s0">deviation from that theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles,</span>
<span class="s0">Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.</span>

<span class="s0">The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme,</span>
<span class="s0">as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The</span>
<span class="s0">members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from</span>
<span class="s0">Vilna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides</span>
<span class="s0">being advocates of bold action, this section also represented</span>
<span class="s0">nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They</span>
<span class="s0">were Russians: Bagration, Ermolov (who was beginning to come to the</span>
<span class="s0">front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Ermolov's was</span>
<span class="s0">being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering</span>
<span class="s0">Suvorov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins</span>
<span class="s0">into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and</span>
<span class="s0">not let the army get discouraged.</span>

<span class="s0">To the third party--in which the Emperor had most confidence-</span>
<span class="s0">belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the</span>
<span class="s0">other two. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom</span>
<span class="s0">Arakcheev belonged, thought and said what men who have no</span>
<span class="s0">convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say. They said</span>
<span class="s0">that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as</span>
<span class="s0">Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised</span>
<span class="s0">plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel</span>
<span class="s0">was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that</span>
<span class="s0">the theorists are often one sided, and therefore one should not</span>
<span class="s0">trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel's</span>
<span class="s0">opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and</span>
<span class="s0">then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the</span>
<span class="s0">camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel's plan, but on changing the</span>
<span class="s0">movements of the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim</span>
<span class="s0">nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents</span>
<span class="s0">of this third party.</span>

<span class="s0">Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the</span>
<span class="s0">Tsarevich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz,</span>
<span class="s0">where he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and</span>
<span class="s0">cavalry uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French</span>
<span class="s0">gallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had</span>
<span class="s0">narrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of this party had</span>
<span class="s0">both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They</span>
<span class="s0">feared Napoleon, recognized his strength and their own weakness, and</span>
<span class="s0">frankly said so. They said: &quot;Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin</span>
<span class="s0">will come of all this! We have abandoned Vilna and Vitebsk and shall</span>
<span class="s0">abandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude</span>
<span class="s0">peace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of Petersburg.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">This view was very general in the upper army circles and found</span>
<span class="s0">support also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyantsev, who,</span>
<span class="s0">for other reasons of state, was in favor of peace.</span>

<span class="s0">The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay</span>
<span class="s0">de Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in</span>
<span class="s0">chief. &quot;Be he what he may&quot; (they always began like that), &quot;he is an</span>
<span class="s0">honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real</span>
<span class="s0">power, for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of</span>
<span class="s0">command, and he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our</span>
<span class="s0">army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa</span>
<span class="s0">without suffering any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at</span>
<span class="s0">any rate there was no one more active and experienced than</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen: &quot;and twist about as you may, you will have to come to</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes now!&quot; said they,</span>
<span class="s0">arguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse</span>
<span class="s0">and an unbroken series of blunders. &quot;The more mistakes that are made</span>
<span class="s0">the better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that</span>
<span class="s0">things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or</span>
<span class="s0">other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to</span>
<span class="s0">whom Napoleon himself did justice--a man whose authority would be</span>
<span class="s0">willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always</span>
<span class="s0">to be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there</span>
<span class="s0">were particularly many round Alexander--generals and imperial</span>
<span class="s0">aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a</span>
<span class="s0">monarch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov had done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues</span>
<span class="s0">but all human capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with</span>
<span class="s0">the sovereign for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for</span>
<span class="s0">such excessive modesty, and only desired and insisted that their</span>
<span class="s0">adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce</span>
<span class="s0">that he would place himself at the head of the army, gather round</span>
<span class="s0">him a commander in chief's staff, and, consulting experienced</span>
<span class="s0">theoreticians and practical men where necessary, would himself lead</span>
<span class="s0">the troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest</span>
<span class="s0">pitch.</span>

<span class="s0">The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to</span>
<span class="s0">the others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither</span>
<span class="s0">peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa</span>
<span class="s0">or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing--as much advantage</span>
<span class="s0">and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of</span>
<span class="s0">conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at</span>
<span class="s0">other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post</span>
<span class="s0">would today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the</span>
<span class="s0">day after, merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor,</span>
<span class="s0">would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who</span>
<span class="s0">wished to gain some advantage would attract the Emperor's attention by</span>
<span class="s0">loudly advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day</span>
<span class="s0">before, and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast</span>
<span class="s0">and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby</span>
<span class="s0">proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good.</span>
<span class="s0">A third, in the absence of opponents, between two councils would</span>
<span class="s0">simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services, well</span>
<span class="s0">knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him.</span>
<span class="s0">A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come</span>
<span class="s0">accidentally under the Emperor's eye. A fifth, to achieve his</span>
<span class="s0">long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist</span>
<span class="s0">on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for</span>
<span class="s0">this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct.</span>

<span class="s0">All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations,</span>
<span class="s0">and promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of</span>
<span class="s0">imperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction,</span>
<span class="s0">this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way,</span>
<span class="s0">so that it was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere.</span>
<span class="s0">Amid the uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious</span>
<span class="s0">danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid</span>
<span class="s0">this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings,</span>
<span class="s0">and the diversity of race among these people--this eighth and</span>
<span class="s0">largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted</span>
<span class="s0">great confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever question</span>
<span class="s0">arose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their</span>
<span class="s0">buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum</span>
<span class="s0">drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly.</span>

<span class="s0">From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached</span>
<span class="s0">the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning</span>
<span class="s0">to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men</span>
<span class="s0">experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any</span>
<span class="s0">of those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of</span>
<span class="s0">what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means</span>
<span class="s0">of escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.</span>

<span class="s0">The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong</span>
<span class="s0">resulted chiefly from the Emperor's presence in the army with his</span>
<span class="s0">military court and from the consequent presence there of an</span>
<span class="s0">indefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluctuation of relations,</span>
<span class="s0">which is in place at court but harmful in an army; that a sovereign</span>
<span class="s0">should reign but not command the army, and that the only way out of</span>
<span class="s0">the position would be for the Emperor and his court to leave the army;</span>
<span class="s0">that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the action of fifty</span>
<span class="s0">thousand men required to secure his personal safety, and that the</span>
<span class="s0">worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the</span>
<span class="s0">very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch.</span>

<span class="s0">Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,</span>
<span class="s0">Shishkov, the Secretary of State and one of the chief</span>
<span class="s0">representatives of this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which</span>
<span class="s0">Arakcheev and Balashev agreed to sign. In this letter, availing</span>
<span class="s0">himself of permission given him by the Emperor to discuss the</span>
<span class="s0">general course of affairs, he respectfully suggested--on the plea that</span>
<span class="s0">it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the</span>
<span class="s0">people of the capital--that the Emperor should leave the army.</span>

<span class="s0">That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to</span>
<span class="s0">them to defend their country--the very incitement which was the</span>
<span class="s0">chief cause of Russia's triumph in so far as it was produced by the</span>
<span class="s0">Tsar's personal presence in Moscow--was suggested to the Emperor,</span>
<span class="s0">and accepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the army.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay, one day at dinner, informed Bolkonski that the sovereign</span>
<span class="s0">wished to see him personally, to question him about Turkey, and that</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen's quarters at six</span>
<span class="s0">that evening.</span>

<span class="s0">News was received at the Emperor's quarters that very day of a fresh</span>
<span class="s0">movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army--news</span>
<span class="s0">subsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had</span>
<span class="s0">ridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had</span>
<span class="s0">pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel,</span>
<span class="s0">and till then considered a chef-d'oeuvre of tactical science which</span>
<span class="s0">would ensure Napoleon's destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the</span>
<span class="s0">destruction of the Russian army.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen's quarters--a country gentleman's</span>
<span class="s0">house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river.</span>
<span class="s0">Neither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernyshev, the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor's aide-de-camp, received Bolkonski and informed him that the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had</span>
<span class="s0">gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the</span>
<span class="s0">Drissa camp, of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning</span>
<span class="s0">to be felt.</span>

<span class="s0">Chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French</span>
<span class="s0">novel in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was</span>
<span class="s0">still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one</span>
<span class="s0">corner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen's adjutant. This</span>
<span class="s0">adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently exhausted by work or by feasting. Two doors led from the</span>
<span class="s0">room, one straight on into what had been the drawing room, and</span>
<span class="s0">another, on the right, to the study. Through the first door came the</span>
<span class="s0">sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally in French. In</span>
<span class="s0">that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor's wish, not a military</span>
<span class="s0">council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain persons</span>
<span class="s0">whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending</span>
<span class="s0">difficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it were, a</span>
<span class="s0">council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally.</span>
<span class="s0">To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General Armfeldt,</span>
<span class="s0">Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had referred</span>
<span class="s0">to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein who was</span>
<span class="s0">not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew had</span>
<span class="s0">an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon</span>
<span class="s0">after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a</span>
<span class="s0">minute to speak to Chernyshev.</span>

<span class="s0">At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,</span>
<span class="s0">which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about</span>
<span class="s0">him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German</span>
<span class="s0">theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more</span>
<span class="s0">typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German</span>
<span class="s0">theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united</span>
<span class="s0">to such an extent.</span>

<span class="s0">Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust</span>
<span class="s0">build, broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face</span>
<span class="s0">was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been</span>
<span class="s0">hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in</span>
<span class="s0">quaint little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and</span>
<span class="s0">angrily around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment.</span>
<span class="s0">Awkwardly holding up his sword, he addressed Chernyshev and asked in</span>
<span class="s0">German where the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass</span>
<span class="s0">through the rooms as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and</span>
<span class="s0">greetings, and sit down to business in front of a map, where he</span>
<span class="s0">would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply to Chernyshev, and</span>
<span class="s0">smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the</span>
<span class="s0">fortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with his</span>
<span class="s0">theory. He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice,</span>
<span class="s0">as self-assured Germans do--it might have been &quot;stupid fellow&quot;... or</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;the whole affair will be ruined,&quot; or &quot;something absurd will come of</span>
<span class="s0">it.&quot;... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed</span>
<span class="s0">on, but Chernyshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew was just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so</span>
<span class="s0">fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced--not so much at Prince Andrew as</span>
<span class="s0">past him--and said, with a laugh: &quot;That must have been a fine tactical</span>
<span class="s0">war&quot;; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room from which</span>
<span class="s0">the sound of voices was heard.</span>

<span class="s0">Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly</span>
<span class="s0">disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to</span>
<span class="s0">inspect and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short</span>
<span class="s0">interview with Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz</span>
<span class="s0">experiences, was able to form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was</span>
<span class="s0">one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men,</span>
<span class="s0">self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are,</span>
<span class="s0">because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract</span>
<span class="s0">notion--science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth.</span>
<span class="s0">A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally,</span>
<span class="s0">both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An</span>
<span class="s0">Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized</span>
<span class="s0">state in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows what</span>
<span class="s0">he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is</span>
<span class="s0">undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is</span>
<span class="s0">excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is</span>
<span class="s0">self-assured just because he knows nothing does not want to know</span>
<span class="s0">anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The</span>
<span class="s0">German's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive</span>
<span class="s0">than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth-</span>
<span class="s0">science--which he himself has invented but which is for him the</span>
<span class="s0">absolute truth.</span>

<span class="s0">Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science--the theory of</span>
<span class="s0">oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the</span>
<span class="s0">Great's wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent</span>
<span class="s0">warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous--monstrous collisions in</span>
<span class="s0">which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars</span>
<span class="s0">could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and</span>
<span class="s0">therefore could not serve as material for science.</span>

<span class="s0">In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of</span>
<span class="s0">campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstadt, but he did not see the</span>
<span class="s0">least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of</span>
<span class="s0">that war. On the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were,</span>
<span class="s0">in his opinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with</span>
<span class="s0">characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark, &quot;There, I said the</span>
<span class="s0">whole affair would go to the devil!&quot; Pfuel was one of those</span>
<span class="s0">theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the</span>
<span class="s0">theory's object--its practical application. His love of theory made</span>
<span class="s0">him hate everything practical, and he would not listen to it. He was</span>
<span class="s0">even pleased by failures, for failures resulting from deviations in</span>
<span class="s0">practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his</span>
<span class="s0">theory.</span>

<span class="s0">He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about the</span>
<span class="s0">present war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all</span>
<span class="s0">will go wrong, and who is not displeased that it should be so. The</span>
<span class="s0">unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed</span>
<span class="s0">hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently.</span>

<span class="s0">He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of</span>
<span class="s0">his voice were at once heard from there.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when</span>
<span class="s0">Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkonski, but not</span>
<span class="s0">pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as</span>
<span class="s0">he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened</span>
<span class="s0">on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.</span>
<span class="s0">Chernyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was</span>
<span class="s0">talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head</span>
<span class="s0">bent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the</span>
<span class="s0">flushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and</span>
<span class="s0">continued to speak.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And as for the man who advised forming this camp--the Drissa camp,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, &quot;as to that person, sire...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">continued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain</span>
<span class="s0">himself, &quot;the man who advised the Drissa camp--I see no alternative</span>
<span class="s0">but the lunatic asylum or the gallows!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Without heeding the end of the Italian's remarks, and as though</span>
<span class="s0">not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkonski, addressed him</span>
<span class="s0">graciously.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting,</span>
<span class="s0">and wait for me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter</span>
<span class="s0">Mikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind</span>
<span class="s0">them. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor's permission,</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room where the council was assembled.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position, as it</span>
<span class="s0">were, of chief of the Emperor's staff. He came out of the study into</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put</span>
<span class="s0">questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen</span>
<span class="s0">present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to</span>
<span class="s0">be false) had been received during the night of a movement by the</span>
<span class="s0">French to outflank the Drissa camp.</span>

<span class="s0">The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the</span>
<span class="s0">difficulty that presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly</span>
<span class="s0">new position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for</span>
<span class="s0">this was inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could</span>
<span class="s0">have an opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should</span>
<span class="s0">unite and there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had</span>
<span class="s0">thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to</span>
<span class="s0">answer the questions put--which, in fact, his plan did not answer-</span>
<span class="s0">as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it. It was one of the</span>
<span class="s0">millions of proposals, one as good as another, that could be made as</span>
<span class="s0">long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take. Some</span>
<span class="s0">disputed his arguments, others defended them. Young Count Toll</span>
<span class="s0">objected to the Swedish general's views more warmly than anyone</span>
<span class="s0">else, and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a</span>
<span class="s0">well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to read to them. In</span>
<span class="s0">these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally</span>
<span class="s0">different from Armfeldt's or Pfuel's plan of campaign. In answer to</span>
<span class="s0">Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged,</span>
<span class="s0">could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the</span>
<span class="s0">trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.</span>

<span class="s0">During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen</span>
<span class="s0">(his &quot;bridge&quot; in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted</span>
<span class="s0">contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean</span>
<span class="s0">himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Volkonski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his</span>
<span class="s0">opinion, he merely said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position</span>
<span class="s0">with an exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman's attack--very</span>
<span class="s0">fine, or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?&quot; said he. &quot;Why, you</span>
<span class="s0">yourselves know everything better than I do.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But when Volkonski said, with a frown, that it was in the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor's name that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">growing animated, began to speak:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody</span>
<span class="s0">thought they knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How</span>
<span class="s0">mend matters? There is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me</span>
<span class="s0">must be strictly adhered to,&quot; said he, drumming on the table with</span>
<span class="s0">his bony fingers. &quot;What is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no</span>
<span class="s0">eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that</span>
<span class="s0">everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really</span>
<span class="s0">going to outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.</span>

<span class="s0">Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in</span>
<span class="s0">French. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French</span>
<span class="s0">badly, and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with</span>
<span class="s0">Pfuel, who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had</span>
<span class="s0">happened, but all that could happen, had been foreseen in his</span>
<span class="s0">scheme, and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault</span>
<span class="s0">lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed. He kept</span>
<span class="s0">laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at last contemptuously</span>
<span class="s0">ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who ceases to prove in</span>
<span class="s0">various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved.</span>
<span class="s0">Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in</span>
<span class="s0">French, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, &quot;Is it not so,</span>
<span class="s0">your excellency?&quot; But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who</span>

<span class="s0">strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at his own supporter,</span>
<span class="s0">Wolzogen:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, of course, what more is there to explain?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in</span>
<span class="s0">French. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to</span>
<span class="s0">Volkonski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,</span>
<span class="s0">determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those</span>
<span class="s0">present, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself,</span>
<span class="s0">nursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan,</span>
<span class="s0">formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out.</span>
<span class="s0">He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired</span>
<span class="s0">involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides</span>
<span class="s0">this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had</span>
<span class="s0">not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a</span>
<span class="s0">panic fear of Napoleon's genius, which, though concealed, was</span>
<span class="s0">noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible</span>
<span class="s0">for Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his</span>
<span class="s0">terrible name to shatter each other's proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his</span>
<span class="s0">theory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him</span>
<span class="s0">and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel's own</span>
<span class="s0">expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself</span>
<span class="s0">felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and</span>
<span class="s0">grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly</span>
<span class="s0">brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he</span>
<span class="s0">concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was</span>
<span class="s0">evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his</span>
<span class="s0">theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole</span>
<span class="s0">world was slipping away from him.</span>

<span class="s0">The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted</span>
<span class="s0">the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and</span>
<span class="s0">personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general</span>
<span class="s0">conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to</span>
<span class="s0">this polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and</span>
<span class="s0">shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought</span>
<span class="s0">that had long since and often occurred to him during his military</span>
<span class="s0">activities--the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of</span>
<span class="s0">war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military</span>
<span class="s0">genius--now appeared to him an obvious truth. &quot;What theory and science</span>
<span class="s0">is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which</span>
<span class="s0">are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the</span>
<span class="s0">acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to</span>
<span class="s0">foresee in what condition our or the enemy's armies will be in a day's</span>
<span class="s0">time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment.</span>
<span class="s0">Sometimes--when there is not a coward at the front to shout, 'We are</span>
<span class="s0">cut off!' and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts,</span>
<span class="s0">'Hurrah!'--a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand,</span>
<span class="s0">as at Schon Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run from eight</span>
<span class="s0">thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in</span>
<span class="s0">which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and</span>
<span class="s0">everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of</span>
<span class="s0">which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one</span>
<span class="s0">knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says</span>
<span class="s0">we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the</span>
<span class="s0">worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,</span>
<span class="s0">and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes</span>
<span class="s0">one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the</span>
<span class="s0">advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.</span>
<span class="s0">And why do they all speak of a 'military genius'? Is a man a genius</span>
<span class="s0">who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who</span>
<span class="s0">is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military</span>
<span class="s0">men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter</span>
<span class="s0">power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess.</span>
<span class="s0">The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or</span>
<span class="s0">absent-minded men. Bagration was the best, Napoleon himself admitted</span>
<span class="s0">that. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied</span>
<span class="s0">face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander</span>
<span class="s0">not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence</span>
<span class="s0">of the highest and best human attributes--love, poetry, tenderness,</span>
<span class="s0">and philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly</span>
<span class="s0">convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will</span>
<span class="s0">not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave</span>
<span class="s0">leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity,</span>
<span class="s0">or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a</span>
<span class="s0">theory of their 'genius' was invented for them long ago because they</span>
<span class="s0">have power! The success of a military action depends not on them,</span>
<span class="s0">but on the man in the ranks who shouts, 'We are lost!' or who</span>
<span class="s0">shouts, 'Hurrah!' And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance</span>
<span class="s0">of being useful.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he</span>
<span class="s0">roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.</span>

<span class="s0">At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he</span>
<span class="s0">would like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court</span>
<span class="s0">circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign's</span>
<span class="s0">person, but for permission to serve in the army.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostov had received a letter</span>
<span class="s0">from his parents in which they told him briefly of Natasha's illness</span>
<span class="s0">and the breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they</span>
<span class="s0">explained by Natasha's having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">to retire from the army and return home. On receiving this letter,</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to</span>
<span class="s0">retire from the army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha was ill and her engagement broken off, and that he would do</span>
<span class="s0">all he could to meet their wishes. To Sonya he wrote separately.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Adored friend of my soul!&quot; he wrote. &quot;Nothing but honor could</span>
<span class="s0">keep me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of</span>
<span class="s0">the campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades'</span>
<span class="s0">eyes but in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and</span>
<span class="s0">duty to the Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe</span>
<span class="s0">me, directly the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by</span>
<span class="s0">you, I will throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever</span>
<span class="s0">to my ardent breast.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that</span>
<span class="s0">prevented Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya. The autumn in Otradnoe with the hunting, and the winter with</span>
<span class="s0">the Christmas holidays and Sonya's love, had opened out to him a vista</span>
<span class="s0">of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before,</span>
<span class="s0">and which now allured him. &quot;A splendid wife, children, a good pack</span>
<span class="s0">of hounds, a dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors,</span>
<span class="s0">service by election...&quot; thought he. But now the campaign was</span>
<span class="s0">beginning, and he had to remain with his regiment. And since it had to</span>
<span class="s0">be so, Nicholas Rostov, as was natural to him, felt contented with the</span>
<span class="s0">life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that</span>
<span class="s0">life.</span>

<span class="s0">On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully</span>
<span class="s0">welcomed by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back</span>
<span class="s0">from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him</span>
<span class="s0">commendation from his commanders. During his absence he had been</span>
<span class="s0">promoted captain, and when the regiment was put on war footing with an</span>
<span class="s0">increase in numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.</span>

<span class="s0">The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double</span>
<span class="s0">pay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody</span>
<span class="s0">was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the</span>
<span class="s0">commencement of a war, and Rostov, conscious of his advantageous</span>
<span class="s0">position in the regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures</span>
<span class="s0">and interests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later</span>
<span class="s0">he would have to relinquish them.</span>

<span class="s0">The troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons of</span>
<span class="s0">state, political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and</span>
<span class="s0">passions at headquarters. For the Pavlograd hussars, however, the</span>
<span class="s0">whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with</span>
<span class="s0">sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business.</span>

<span class="s0">It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness,</span>
<span class="s0">and intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves</span>
<span class="s0">where they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat,</span>
<span class="s0">it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown</span>
<span class="s0">accustomed to, or some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that</span>
<span class="s0">things looked bad chanced to enter anyone's head, he tried to be as</span>
<span class="s0">cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general</span>
<span class="s0">trend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand. First they</span>
<span class="s0">camped gaily before Vilna, making acquaintance with the Polish</span>
<span class="s0">landowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">and other high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyani</span>
<span class="s0">and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them.</span>
<span class="s0">Sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a</span>
<span class="s0">name the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many</span>
<span class="s0">complaints were made against the troops, who, taking advantage of</span>
<span class="s0">the order to collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, and</span>
<span class="s0">carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostov remembered Sventsyani,</span>
<span class="s0">because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he</span>
<span class="s0">changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken</span>
<span class="s0">men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels</span>
<span class="s0">of old beer. From Sventsyani they retired farther and farther to</span>
<span class="s0">Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier</span>
<span class="s0">of Russia proper.</span>

<span class="s0">On the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a serious</span>
<span class="s0">action for the first time.</span>

<span class="s0">On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy</span>
<span class="s0">storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was</span>
<span class="s0">remarkable for its storms.</span>

<span class="s0">The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye,</span>
<span class="s0">which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by</span>
<span class="s0">cattle and horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostov,</span>
<span class="s0">with a young officer named Ilyin, his protege, was sitting in a</span>
<span class="s0">hastily constructed shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long</span>
<span class="s0">mustaches extending onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had</span>
<span class="s0">been overtaken by the rain, entered Rostov's shelter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raevski's</span>
<span class="s0">exploit?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the officer gave them details of the Saltanov battle, which he</span>
<span class="s0">had heard at the staff.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water</span>
<span class="s0">trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional</span>
<span class="s0">glance at Ilyin, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of</span>
<span class="s0">sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same</span>
<span class="s0">relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years</span>
<span class="s0">before. Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything and adored him</span>
<span class="s0">as a girl might have done.</span>

<span class="s0">Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke</span>
<span class="s0">grandiloquently of the Saltanov dam being &quot;a Russian Thermopylae,&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General</span>
<span class="s0">Raevski. He recounted how Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam</span>
<span class="s0">under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him. Rostov heard</span>
<span class="s0">the story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski's</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man ashamed of what</span>
<span class="s0">he was hearing, though with no intention of contradicting it. Since</span>
<span class="s0">the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that</span>
<span class="s0">men always lie when describing military exploits, as he himself had</span>
<span class="s0">done when recounting them; besides that, he had experience enough to</span>
<span class="s0">know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate</span>
<span class="s0">it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski's tale, nor did he like</span>
<span class="s0">Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his</span>
<span class="s0">cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and</span>
<span class="s0">crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty. Rostov looked at him in</span>
<span class="s0">silence. &quot;In the first place, there must have been such a confusion</span>
<span class="s0">and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did</span>
<span class="s0">lead his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on</span>
<span class="s0">some dozen men nearest to him,&quot; thought he, &quot;the rest could not have</span>
<span class="s0">seen how or with whom Raevski came onto the dam. And even those who</span>
<span class="s0">did see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had</span>
<span class="s0">they to do with Raevski's tender paternal feelings when their own</span>
<span class="s0">skins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did</span>
<span class="s0">not depend on whether they took the Saltanov dam or not, as we are</span>
<span class="s0">told was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a</span>
<span class="s0">sacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would</span>
<span class="s0">not have taken my brother Petya there, or even Ilyin, who's a stranger</span>
<span class="s0">to me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under</span>
<span class="s0">cover,&quot; Nicholas continued to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But</span>
<span class="s0">he did not express his thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had</span>
<span class="s0">gained experience. He knew that this tale redounded to the glory of</span>
<span class="s0">our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted</span>
<span class="s0">accordingly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I can't stand this any more,&quot; said Ilyin, noticing that Rostov</span>
<span class="s0">did not relish Zdrzhinski's conversation. &quot;My stockings and shirt...</span>
<span class="s0">and the water is running on my seat! I'll go and look for shelter. The</span>
<span class="s0">rain seems less heavy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Ilyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.</span>

<span class="s0">Five minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, came running</span>
<span class="s0">back to the shanty.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I've found it! About two hundred</span>
<span class="s0">yards away there's a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can</span>
<span class="s0">at least get dry there, and Mary Hendrikhovna's there.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mary Hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty</span>
<span class="s0">young German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether</span>
<span class="s0">from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young</span>
<span class="s0">wife in the early days of their marriage, took her about with him</span>
<span class="s0">wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a</span>
<span class="s0">standing joke among the hussar officers.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrushka to</span>
<span class="s0">follow with the things, and--now slipping in the mud, now splashing</span>
<span class="s0">right through it--set off with Ilyin in the lessening rain and the</span>
<span class="s0">darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Rostov, where are you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here. What lightning!&quot; they called to one another.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">In the tavern, before which stood the doctor's covered cart, there</span>
<span class="s0">were already some five officers. Mary Hendrikhovna, a plump little</span>
<span class="s0">blonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a</span>
<span class="s0">broad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep</span>
<span class="s0">behind her. Rostov and Ilyin, on entering the room, were welcomed with</span>
<span class="s0">merry shouts and laughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear me, how jolly we are!&quot; said Rostov laughing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And why do you stand there gaping?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don't</span>
<span class="s0">make our drawing room so wet.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't mess Mary Hendrikhovna's dress!&quot; cried other voices.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov and Ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change</span>
<span class="s0">into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendrikhovna's modesty. They</span>
<span class="s0">were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but</span>
<span class="s0">found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards</span>
<span class="s0">by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these</span>
<span class="s0">officers would on no account yield their position. Mary Hendrikhovna</span>
<span class="s0">obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and</span>
<span class="s0">behind that screen Rostov and Ilyin, helped by Lavrushka who had</span>
<span class="s0">brought their kits, changed their wet things for dry ones.</span>

<span class="s0">A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was</span>
<span class="s0">found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small</span>
<span class="s0">samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and</span>
<span class="s0">having asked Mary Hendrikhovna to preside, they all crowded round her.</span>
<span class="s0">One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands,</span>
<span class="s0">another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the</span>
<span class="s0">damp, another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft, and</span>
<span class="s0">yet another waved the flies off her husband's face, lest he should</span>
<span class="s0">wake up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Leave him alone,&quot; said Mary Hendrikhovna, smiling timidly and</span>
<span class="s0">happily. &quot;He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna,&quot; replied the officer, &quot;one must look</span>
<span class="s0">after the doctor. Perhaps he'll take pity on me someday, when it comes</span>
<span class="s0">to cutting off a leg or an arm for me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one</span>
<span class="s0">could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar</span>
<span class="s0">held only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter</span>
<span class="s0">to take turns in order of seniority to receive one's tumbler from Mary</span>
<span class="s0">Hendrikhovna's plump little hands with their short and not overclean</span>
<span class="s0">nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love</span>
<span class="s0">with her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition</span>
<span class="s0">soon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the</span>
<span class="s0">general mood of courting Mary Hendrikhovna. She, seeing herself</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with</span>
<span class="s0">satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she</span>
<span class="s0">evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.</span>

<span class="s0">There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything</span>
<span class="s0">else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary</span>
<span class="s0">Hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostov</span>
<span class="s0">received his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary</span>
<span class="s0">Hendrikhovna to stir it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you take it without sugar?&quot; she said, smiling all the time,</span>
<span class="s0">as if everything she said and everything the others said was very</span>
<span class="s0">amusing and had a double meaning.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should</span>
<span class="s0">stir my tea.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mary Hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which</span>
<span class="s0">someone meanwhile had pounced on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Use your finger, Mary Hendrikhovna, it will be still nicer,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Too hot!&quot; she replied, blushing with pleasure.</span>

<span class="s0">Ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it</span>
<span class="s0">to Mary Hendrikhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is my cup,&quot; said he. &quot;Only dip your finger in it and I'll</span>
<span class="s0">drink it all up.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When they had emptied the samovar, Rostov took a pack of cards and</span>
<span class="s0">proposed that they should play &quot;Kings&quot; with Mary Hendrikhovna. They</span>
<span class="s0">drew lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostov's suggestion</span>
<span class="s0">it was agreed that whoever became &quot;King&quot; should have the right to kiss</span>
<span class="s0">Mary Hendrikhovna's hand, and that the &quot;Booby&quot; should go to refill and</span>
<span class="s0">reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, but supposing Mary Hendrikhovna is 'King'?&quot; asked Ilyin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They had hardly begun to play before the doctor's disheveled head</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna. He had been awake for</span>
<span class="s0">some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found</span>
<span class="s0">nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad</span>
<span class="s0">and depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and</span>
<span class="s0">asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon</span>
<span class="s0">as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter</span>
<span class="s0">and Mary Hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and</span>
<span class="s0">thereby became still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard,</span>
<span class="s0">the doctor told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and</span>
<span class="s0">looked at him in alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had</span>
<span class="s0">ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart, or</span>
<span class="s0">everything in it would be stolen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I'll send an orderly.... Two of them!&quot; said Rostov. &quot;What an</span>
<span class="s0">idea, doctor!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll stand guard on it myself!&quot; said Ilyin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for</span>
<span class="s0">two nights,&quot; replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his</span>
<span class="s0">wife, waiting for the game to end.</span>

<span class="s0">Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers</span>
<span class="s0">grew still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from</span>
<span class="s0">laughter, for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When</span>
<span class="s0">he had gone, taking his wife with him, and had settled down with her</span>
<span class="s0">in their covered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, covering</span>
<span class="s0">themselves with their wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the doctor's uneasiness</span>
<span class="s0">and his wife's delight, now they ran out into the porch and reported</span>
<span class="s0">what was taking place in the covered trap. Several times Rostov,</span>
<span class="s0">covering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would</span>
<span class="s0">arouse him and conversation would be resumed, to the accompaniment</span>
<span class="s0">of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">It was nearly three o'clock but no one was yet asleep, when the</span>
<span class="s0">quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town</span>
<span class="s0">of Ostrovna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water</span>
<span class="s0">in the samovar. But Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting</span>
<span class="s0">for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were</span>
<span class="s0">dispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in clothes that were</span>
<span class="s0">still moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn,</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov and Ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather</span>
<span class="s0">hood of the doctor's cart, from under the apron of which his feet were</span>
<span class="s0">sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife's nightcap was</span>
<span class="s0">visible and her sleepy breathing audible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She really is a dear little thing,&quot; said Rostov to Ilyin, who was</span>
<span class="s0">following him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A charming woman!&quot; said Ilyin, with all the gravity of a boy of</span>
<span class="s0">sixteen.</span>

<span class="s0">Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The</span>
<span class="s0">command was heard to &quot;mount&quot; and the soldiers crossed themselves and</span>
<span class="s0">mounted. Rostov riding in front gave the order &quot;Forward!&quot; and the</span>
<span class="s0">hussars, with clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses' hoofs</span>
<span class="s0">splashing in the mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad</span>
<span class="s0">road planted with birch trees on each side, following the infantry and</span>
<span class="s0">a battery that had gone on in front.</span>

<span class="s0">Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding</span>
<span class="s0">before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly</span>
<span class="s0">grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly</span>
<span class="s0">visible, still wet with the night's rain; the drooping branches of the</span>
<span class="s0">birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of</span>
<span class="s0">water to one side. The soldiers' faces were more and more clearly</span>
<span class="s0">visible. Rostov, always closely followed by Ilyin, rode along the side</span>
<span class="s0">of the road between two rows of birch trees.</span>

<span class="s0">When campaigning, Rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding</span>
<span class="s0">not a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a</span>
<span class="s0">sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome,</span>
<span class="s0">Donets horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he</span>
<span class="s0">rode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor's wife, but not once of the impending danger.</span>

<span class="s0">Formerly, when going into action, Rostov had felt afraid; now he had</span>
<span class="s0">not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had</span>
<span class="s0">grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but</span>
<span class="s0">because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He</span>
<span class="s0">had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything</span>
<span class="s0">but what would seem most likely to interest him--the impending danger.</span>
<span class="s0">During the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as</span>
<span class="s0">he reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this,</span>
<span class="s0">but with time it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyin under</span>
<span class="s0">the birch trees, occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met</span>
<span class="s0">his hand, sometimes touching his horse's side with his foot, or,</span>
<span class="s0">without turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar</span>
<span class="s0">riding behind him, with as calm and careless an air as though he</span>
<span class="s0">were merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited face</span>
<span class="s0">of Ilyin, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from</span>
<span class="s0">experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet</span>
<span class="s0">was suffering and knew that only time could help him.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the</span>
<span class="s0">clouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the</span>
<span class="s0">summer morning after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but</span>
<span class="s0">vertically now, and all was still. The whole sun appeared on the</span>
<span class="s0">horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it.</span>
<span class="s0">A few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top</span>
<span class="s0">of the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew bright and</span>
<span class="s0">glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, came the</span>
<span class="s0">sound of guns ahead of them.</span>

<span class="s0">Before Rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of</span>
<span class="s0">that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy's adjutant came galloping from</span>
<span class="s0">Vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.</span>

<span class="s0">The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery--which</span>
<span class="s0">had also quickened their pace--rode down a hill, and passing through</span>
<span class="s0">an empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to</span>
<span class="s0">lather and the men to flush.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Halt! Dress your ranks!&quot; the order of the regimental commander</span>
<span class="s0">was heard ahead. &quot;Forward by the left. Walk, march!&quot; came the order</span>
<span class="s0">from in front.</span>

<span class="s0">And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left</span>
<span class="s0">flank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the</span>
<span class="s0">front line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they</span>
<span class="s0">were the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns</span>
<span class="s0">were visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated</span>
<span class="s0">by slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be</span>
<span class="s0">seen the enemy's columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in</span>
<span class="s0">action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in</span>
<span class="s0">the dale.</span>

<span class="s0">At these sounds, long unheard, Rostov's spirits rose, as at the</span>
<span class="s0">strains of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots,</span>
<span class="s0">now together, now several quickly one after another. Again all was</span>
<span class="s0">silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on</span>
<span class="s0">detonators and exploding them.</span>

<span class="s0">The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A</span>
<span class="s0">cannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the</span>
<span class="s0">squadron, halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode</span>
<span class="s0">up the hill to the guns.</span>

<span class="s0">After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Form column! Prepare to charge!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the</span>
<span class="s0">cavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears</span>
<span class="s0">fluttering, and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was</span>
<span class="s0">seen below to the left.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered</span>
<span class="s0">up the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by</span>
<span class="s0">the Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but</span>
<span class="s0">fell spent without taking effect.</span>

<span class="s0">The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more</span>
<span class="s0">pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostov than the previous sounds</span>
<span class="s0">of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening</span>
<span class="s0">out before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the</span>
<span class="s0">movement of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French</span>
<span class="s0">dragoons, something confused happened there amid the smoke, and five</span>
<span class="s0">minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they</span>
<span class="s0">had occupied but more to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans</span>
<span class="s0">on chestnut horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French</span>
<span class="s0">dragoons on gray horses could be seen.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">Rostov, with his keen sportsman's eye, was one of the first to catch</span>
<span class="s0">sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and</span>
<span class="s0">nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons</span>
<span class="s0">pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small</span>
<span class="s0">at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving</span>
<span class="s0">their arms and their sabers in the air.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He</span>
<span class="s0">felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons</span>
<span class="s0">now, the latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be</span>
<span class="s0">made it must be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too</span>
<span class="s0">late. He looked around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing</span>
<span class="s0">like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Andrew Sevastyanych!&quot; said Rostov. &quot;You know, we could crush</span>
<span class="s0">them....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A fine thing too!&quot; replied the captain, &quot;and really...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped</span>
<span class="s0">to the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish</span>
<span class="s0">giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling,</span>
<span class="s0">was following him. Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it.</span>
<span class="s0">He acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He</span>
<span class="s0">saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder; he</span>
<span class="s0">knew they could not withstand an attack--knew there was only that</span>
<span class="s0">moment and that if he let it slip it would not return. The bullets</span>
<span class="s0">were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse</span>
<span class="s0">was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself. He touched</span>
<span class="s0">his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind</span>
<span class="s0">him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full</span>
<span class="s0">trot downhill toward the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the</span>
<span class="s0">bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a</span>
<span class="s0">gallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans</span>
<span class="s0">and the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now</span>
<span class="s0">close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the foremost began to turn,</span>
<span class="s0">while those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which</span>
<span class="s0">he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostov gave rein to his</span>
<span class="s0">Donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons'</span>
<span class="s0">disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung</span>
<span class="s0">himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless</span>
<span class="s0">horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were</span>
<span class="s0">galloping back. Rostov, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed</span>
<span class="s0">after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared</span>
<span class="s0">it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that</span>
<span class="s0">he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching</span>
<span class="s0">on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another moment</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov's horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the</span>
<span class="s0">officer's horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman</span>
<span class="s0">with it.</span>

<span class="s0">The instant he had done this, all Rostov's animation vanished. The</span>
<span class="s0">officer fell, not so much from the blow--which had but slightly cut</span>
<span class="s0">his arm above the elbow--as from the shock to his horse and from</span>
<span class="s0">fright. Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see</span>
<span class="s0">whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with</span>
<span class="s0">one foot on the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another</span>
<span class="s0">blow, gazed up at Rostov with shrinking terror. His pale and</span>
<span class="s0">mud-stained face--fair and young, with a dimple in the chin and</span>
<span class="s0">light-blue eyes--was not an enemy's face at all suited to a</span>
<span class="s0">battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostov had</span>
<span class="s0">decided what to do with him, the officer cried, &quot;I surrender!&quot; He</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and</span>
<span class="s0">did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostov's face. Some</span>
<span class="s0">hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the</span>
<span class="s0">saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was</span>
<span class="s0">wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his</span>
<span class="s0">horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round</span>
<span class="s0">him; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In</span>
<span class="s0">front, the French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars</span>
<span class="s0">galloped hastily back with their prisoners. Rostov galloped back</span>
<span class="s0">with the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his</span>
<span class="s0">heart. Something vague and confused, which he could not at all account</span>
<span class="s0">for, had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow</span>
<span class="s0">he had dealt him.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, sent for</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov, thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George's Cross. When</span>
<span class="s0">sent for by Count Ostermann, Rostov, remembering that he had charged</span>
<span class="s0">without orders, felt sure his commander was sending for him to</span>
<span class="s0">punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann's flattering words</span>
<span class="s0">and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the</span>
<span class="s0">more pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of moral nausea. &quot;But what on earth is worrying me?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">asked himself as he rode back from the general. &quot;Ilyin? No, he's safe.</span>
<span class="s0">Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that's not it.&quot; Something</span>
<span class="s0">else, resembling remorse, tormented him. &quot;Yes, oh yes, that French</span>
<span class="s0">officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I</span>
<span class="s0">raised it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to</span>
<span class="s0">have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was</span>
<span class="s0">sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked</span>
<span class="s0">anxiously about him; The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called</span>
<span class="s0">a wound. He glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and waved his</span>
<span class="s0">hand in greeting. Rostov still had the same indefinite feeling, as</span>
<span class="s0">of shame.</span>

<span class="s0">All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and</span>
<span class="s0">preoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept</span>
<span class="s0">turning something over in his mind.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his,</span>
<span class="s0">which to his amazement had gained him the St. George's Cross and</span>
<span class="s0">even given him a reputation for bravery, and there was something he</span>
<span class="s0">could not at all understand. &quot;So others are even more afraid than I</span>
<span class="s0">am!&quot; he thought. &quot;So that's all there is in what is called heroism!</span>
<span class="s0">And heroism! And did I do it for my country's sake? And how was he</span>
<span class="s0">to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He</span>
<span class="s0">thought that I should kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand</span>
<span class="s0">trembled. And they have given me a St. George's Cross.... I can't make</span>
<span class="s0">it out at all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could</span>
<span class="s0">reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune</span>
<span class="s0">in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the</span>
<span class="s0">affair at Ostrovna he was brought into notice, received command of</span>
<span class="s0">an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was</span>
<span class="s0">chosen.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">On receiving news of Natasha's illness, the countess, though not</span>
<span class="s0">quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Petya and the</span>
<span class="s0">rest of the household, and the whole family moved from Marya</span>
<span class="s0">Dmitrievna's house to their own and settled down in town.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha's illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for</span>
<span class="s0">her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her</span>
<span class="s0">conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the</span>
<span class="s0">background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider</span>
<span class="s0">in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat</span>
<span class="s0">or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them</span>
<span class="s0">feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to</span>
<span class="s0">help her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked</span>
<span class="s0">much in French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and</span>
<span class="s0">prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known</span>
<span class="s0">to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they</span>
<span class="s0">could not know the disease Natasha was suffering from, as no disease</span>
<span class="s0">suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his</span>
<span class="s0">own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel,</span>
<span class="s0">complicated disease, unknown to medicine--not a disease of the</span>
<span class="s0">lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical</span>
<span class="s0">books, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations</span>
<span class="s0">of the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur</span>
<span class="s0">to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to</span>
<span class="s0">work his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure,</span>
<span class="s0">and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their</span>
<span class="s0">lives on that business. But, above all, that thought was kept out of</span>
<span class="s0">their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful, as in</span>
<span class="s0">fact they were to the whole Rostov family. Their usefulness did not</span>
<span class="s0">depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part</span>
<span class="s0">harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they were given in</span>
<span class="s0">small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and indispensable</span>
<span class="s0">because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who</span>
<span class="s0">loved her--and that is why there are, and always will be,</span>
<span class="s0">pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They</span>
<span class="s0">satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy,</span>
<span class="s0">and that something should be done, which is felt by those who are</span>
<span class="s0">suffering. They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in</span>
<span class="s0">a child, when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A</span>
<span class="s0">child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or</span>
<span class="s0">nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better</span>
<span class="s0">when this is done. The child cannot believe that the strongest and</span>
<span class="s0">wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain, and the hope of</span>
<span class="s0">relief and the expression of its mother's sympathy while she rubs</span>
<span class="s0">the bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to Natasha because</span>
<span class="s0">they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon</span>
<span class="s0">pass if only the coachman went to the chemist's in the Arbat and got a</span>
<span class="s0">powder and some pills in a pretty box of a ruble and seventy kopeks,</span>
<span class="s0">and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of</span>
<span class="s0">precisely two hours, neither more nor less.</span>

<span class="s0">What would Sonya and the count and countess have done, how would</span>
<span class="s0">they have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been</span>
<span class="s0">those pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken</span>
<span class="s0">cutlets, and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors, the</span>
<span class="s0">carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the</span>
<span class="s0">family circle? How would the count have borne his dearly loved</span>
<span class="s0">daughter's illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand</span>
<span class="s0">rubles, and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her, or</span>
<span class="s0">had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet</span>
<span class="s0">other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there, and</span>
<span class="s0">had he not been able to explain the details of how Metivier and Feller</span>
<span class="s0">had not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and Mudrov had</span>
<span class="s0">diagnosed them even better? What would the countess have done had</span>
<span class="s0">she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly</span>
<span class="s0">obeying the doctor's orders?</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You'll never get well like that,&quot; she would say, forgetting her</span>
<span class="s0">grief in her vexation, &quot;if you won't obey the doctor and take your</span>
<span class="s0">medicine at the right time! You mustn't trifle with it, you know, or</span>
<span class="s0">it may turn to pneumonia,&quot; she would go on, deriving much comfort from</span>
<span class="s0">the utterance of that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well</span>
<span class="s0">as to herself.</span>

<span class="s0">What would Sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she</span>
<span class="s0">had not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be</span>
<span class="s0">ready to carry out all the doctor's injunctions with precision, and</span>
<span class="s0">that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time</span>
<span class="s0">when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be</span>
<span class="s0">administered? Even to Natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so</span>
<span class="s0">many sacrifices were being made for her sake, and to know that she had</span>
<span class="s0">to take medicine at certain hours, though she declared that no</span>
<span class="s0">medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was</span>
<span class="s0">even pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that she</span>
<span class="s0">did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and</span>
<span class="s0">regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he</span>
<span class="s0">had gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed</span>
<span class="s0">him, he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said</span>
<span class="s0">that though there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this</span>
<span class="s0">last medicine and one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly</span>
<span class="s0">mental, but... And the countess, trying to conceal the action from</span>
<span class="s0">herself and from him, slipped a gold coin into his hand and always</span>
<span class="s0">returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind.</span>

<span class="s0">The symptoms of Natasha's illness were that she ate little, slept</span>
<span class="s0">little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that</span>
<span class="s0">she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in</span>
<span class="s0">the stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostovs did not move to</span>
<span class="s0">the country that summer of 1812.</span>

<span class="s0">In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders</span>
<span class="s0">out of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was</span>
<span class="s0">fond of such things made a large collection, and in spite of being</span>
<span class="s0">deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed, youth</span>
<span class="s0">prevailed. Natasha's grief began to be overlaid by the impressions</span>
<span class="s0">of daily life, it ceased to press so painfully on her heart, it</span>
<span class="s0">gradually faded into the past, and she began to recover physically.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">Natasha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all</span>
<span class="s0">external forms of pleasure--balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters-</span>
<span class="s0">but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She</span>
<span class="s0">could not sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by</span>
<span class="s0">herself, tears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection</span>
<span class="s0">of those pure times which could never return, tears of vexation that</span>
<span class="s0">she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have</span>
<span class="s0">been so happy. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a</span>
<span class="s0">blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any need of</span>
<span class="s0">self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever entered her head. She said</span>
<span class="s0">and felt at that time that no man was more to her than Nastasya</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovna, the buffoon. Something stood sentinel within her and forbade</span>
<span class="s0">her every joy. Besides, she had lost all the old interests of her</span>
<span class="s0">carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope. The previous</span>
<span class="s0">autumn, the hunting, &quot;Uncle,&quot; and the Christmas holidays spent with</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas at Otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most</span>
<span class="s0">painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a single</span>
<span class="s0">day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at the</span>
<span class="s0">time had not deceived her--that that state of freedom and readiness</span>
<span class="s0">for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live</span>
<span class="s0">on.</span>

<span class="s0">It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had</span>
<span class="s0">formerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the</span>
<span class="s0">world. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;What next?&quot; But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in</span>
<span class="s0">life, yet life was passing. Natasha apparently tried not to be a</span>
<span class="s0">burden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She</span>
<span class="s0">kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her</span>
<span class="s0">brother Petya. She liked to be with him better than with the others,</span>
<span class="s0">and when alone with him she sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left</span>
<span class="s0">the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one</span>
<span class="s0">person, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her with more</span>
<span class="s0">delicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously than did</span>
<span class="s0">Count Bezukhov. Natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so</span>
<span class="s0">found great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful</span>
<span class="s0">to him for it; nothing good on Pierre's part seemed to her to be an</span>
<span class="s0">effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there</span>
<span class="s0">was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha noticed</span>
<span class="s0">embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,</span>
<span class="s0">especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared</span>
<span class="s0">that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her.</span>
<span class="s0">She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and</span>
<span class="s0">shyness, which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was</span>
<span class="s0">to her. After those involuntary words--that if he were free he would</span>
<span class="s0">have asked on his knees for her hand and her love--uttered at a moment</span>
<span class="s0">when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natasha of</span>
<span class="s0">his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had</span>
<span class="s0">then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words</span>
<span class="s0">are spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because Pierre was</span>
<span class="s0">a married man, but because Natasha felt very strongly with him that</span>
<span class="s0">moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kuragin</span>
<span class="s0">that it never entered her head that the relations between him and</span>
<span class="s0">herself could lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even</span>
<span class="s0">to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a</span>
<span class="s0">man and a woman of which she had known several instances.</span>

<span class="s0">Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agrafena Ivanovna Belova, a</span>
<span class="s0">country neighbor of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions</span>
<span class="s0">at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natasha should</span>
<span class="s0">fast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha gladly welcomed the</span>
<span class="s0">idea. Despite the doctor's orders that she should not go out early</span>
<span class="s0">in the morning, Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the</span>
<span class="s0">sacrament, not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov</span>
<span class="s0">family by attending three services in their own house, but as Agrafena</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovna did, by going to church every day for a week and not once</span>
<span class="s0">missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess was pleased with Natasha's zeal; after the poor results</span>
<span class="s0">of the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that</span>
<span class="s0">prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not</span>
<span class="s0">without fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's wish and entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena Ivanovna used</span>
<span class="s0">to come to wake Natasha at three in the morning, but generally found</span>
<span class="s0">her already awake. She was afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily</span>
<span class="s0">washing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old</span>
<span class="s0">mantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh air, went out into the</span>
<span class="s0">deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By Agrafena</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovna's advice Natasha prepared herself not in their own parish,</span>
<span class="s0">but at a church where, according to the devout Agrafena Ivanovna,</span>
<span class="s0">the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never</span>
<span class="s0">many people in the church; Natasha always stood beside Belova in the</span>
<span class="s0">customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the</span>
<span class="s0">screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her,</span>
<span class="s0">of humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her</span>
<span class="s0">when at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the</span>
<span class="s0">Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning</span>
<span class="s0">light falling from the window, she listened to the words of the</span>
<span class="s0">service which she tried to follow with understanding. When she</span>
<span class="s0">understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the</span>
<span class="s0">prayers with shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was</span>
<span class="s0">sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is</span>
<span class="s0">pride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is only</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt</span>
<span class="s0">guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and</span>
<span class="s0">when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply</span>
<span class="s0">asked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy upon</span>
<span class="s0">her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were</span>
<span class="s0">those of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met</span>
<span class="s0">no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and</span>
<span class="s0">everybody within the houses was still asleep, Natasha experienced a</span>
<span class="s0">feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her</span>
<span class="s0">faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of happiness.</span>

<span class="s0">During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every</span>
<span class="s0">day. And the happiness of taking communion, or &quot;communing&quot; as Agrafena</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.</span>

<span class="s0">But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when,</span>
<span class="s0">dressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the</span>
<span class="s0">first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the</span>
<span class="s0">thought of the life that lay before her.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue</span>
<span class="s0">the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,&quot; said he,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. &quot;Only, please be</span>
<span class="s0">particular about it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Be quite easy,&quot; he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the</span>
<span class="s0">gold coin in his palm. &quot;She will soon be singing and frolicking about.</span>
<span class="s0">The last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has</span>
<span class="s0">freshened up very much.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at</span>
<span class="s0">her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the</span>
<span class="s0">war began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor to the people, and of his coming himself from the army to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had</span>
<span class="s0">been received, exaggerated reports became current about them and about</span>
<span class="s0">the position of Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the</span>
<span class="s0">army because it was in danger, it was said that Smolensk had</span>
<span class="s0">surrendered, that Napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle</span>
<span class="s0">could save Russia.</span>

<span class="s0">On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was</span>
<span class="s0">received but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs', promised to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a</span>
<span class="s0">copy of the manifesto and appeal, which he would obtain from Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin.</span>

<span class="s0">That Sunday, the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskis' private</span>
<span class="s0">chapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o'clock, when</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air,</span>
<span class="s0">the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of</span>
<span class="s0">the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the</span>
<span class="s0">rattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot</span>
<span class="s0">sunshine were all full of that summer languor, that content and</span>
<span class="s0">discontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a</span>
<span class="s0">bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances, were at the Razumovskis' chapel, for, as if expecting</span>
<span class="s0">something to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for</span>
<span class="s0">their country estates had not gone away that summer. As Natasha, at</span>
<span class="s0">her mother's side, passed through the crowd behind a liveried</span>
<span class="s0">footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a young man speaking</span>
<span class="s0">about her in too loud a whisper.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's Rostova, the one who...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She's much thinner, but all the same she's pretty!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kuragin and Bolkonski.</span>
<span class="s0">But she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that</span>
<span class="s0">everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to</span>
<span class="s0">her. With a sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she</span>
<span class="s0">found herself in a crowd, Natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with</span>
<span class="s0">black lace walked--as women can walk--with the more repose and</span>
<span class="s0">stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for</span>
<span class="s0">certain that she was pretty, but this no longer gave her</span>
<span class="s0">satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it tormented her more than</span>
<span class="s0">anything else of late, and particularly so on this bright, hot</span>
<span class="s0">summer day in town. &quot;It's Sunday again--another week past,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">thought, recalling that she had been here the Sunday before, &quot;and</span>
<span class="s0">always the same life that is no life, and the same surroundings in</span>
<span class="s0">which it used to be so easy to live. I'm pretty, I'm young, and I know</span>
<span class="s0">that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I know I am good,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">thought, &quot;but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to</span>
<span class="s0">anyone.&quot; She stood by her mother's side and exchanged nods with</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies'</span>
<span class="s0">dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not</span>
<span class="s0">crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she</span>
<span class="s0">thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was</span>
<span class="s0">judging others, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt</span>
<span class="s0">horrified at her own vileness, horrified that the former purity of her</span>
<span class="s0">soul was again lost to her.</span>

<span class="s0">A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that</span>
<span class="s0">mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the</span>
<span class="s0">souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were</span>
<span class="s0">closed, the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft</span>
<span class="s0">mysterious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which</span>
<span class="s0">she herself did not understand, made Natasha's breast heave, and a</span>
<span class="s0">joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good</span>
<span class="s0">forever, forever!&quot; she pleaded.</span>

<span class="s0">The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen</span>
<span class="s0">and, holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his</span>
<span class="s0">dalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a</span>
<span class="s0">loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer...</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In peace let us pray unto the Lord.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity,</span>
<span class="s0">united by brotherly love--let us pray!&quot; thought Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our</span>
<span class="s0">souls.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">prayed Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she</span>
<span class="s0">remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her</span>
<span class="s0">all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love</span>
<span class="s0">us, she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and</span>
<span class="s0">mother and Sonya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had</span>
<span class="s0">acted toward them, and feeling all the strength of her love for</span>
<span class="s0">them. When they prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of</span>
<span class="s0">her enemies and people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She</span>
<span class="s0">included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business</span>
<span class="s0">dealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies and</span>
<span class="s0">those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much</span>
<span class="s0">harm--and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as</span>
<span class="s0">for an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and</span>
<span class="s0">calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were</span>
<span class="s0">as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed</span>
<span class="s0">for the Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the</span>
<span class="s0">sign of the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not</span>
<span class="s0">understand, still she could not doubt, and at any rate loved the</span>
<span class="s0">governing Synod and prayed for it.</span>

<span class="s0">When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over</span>
<span class="s0">his breast and said, &quot;Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to</span>
<span class="s0">Christ the Lord!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Commit ourselves to God,&quot; Natasha inwardly repeated. &quot;Lord God, I</span>
<span class="s0">submit myself to Thy will!&quot; she thought. &quot;I want nothing, wish for</span>
<span class="s0">nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take</span>
<span class="s0">me!&quot; prayed Natasha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing</span>
<span class="s0">herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some</span>
<span class="s0">invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from</span>
<span class="s0">herself, from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess looked round several times at her daughter's softened</span>
<span class="s0">face and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.</span>

<span class="s0">Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual</span>
<span class="s0">order Natasha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool,</span>
<span class="s0">the one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it</span>
<span class="s0">before the doors of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his</span>
<span class="s0">purple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down</span>
<span class="s0">with an effort. Everybody followed his example and they looked at</span>
<span class="s0">one another in surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the</span>
<span class="s0">Synod--a prayer for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lord God of might, God of our salvation!&quot; began the priest in</span>
<span class="s0">that voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the</span>
<span class="s0">Slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and</span>
<span class="s0">blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and</span>
<span class="s0">have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay</span>
<span class="s0">waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are</span>
<span class="s0">gathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear</span>
<span class="s0">Jerusalem, Thy beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow</span>
<span class="s0">Thine altars, and to desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how</span>
<span class="s0">long shall the wicked triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful</span>
<span class="s0">power?</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might</span>
<span class="s0">our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pavlovich;</span>
<span class="s0">be mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to</span>
<span class="s0">his righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless</span>
<span class="s0">his counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom</span>
<span class="s0">by Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as</span>
<span class="s0">Thou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and</span>
<span class="s0">David over Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands</span>
<span class="s0">of those who have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins</span>
<span class="s0">with strength for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to</span>
<span class="s0">help us; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against</span>
<span class="s0">us, may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust</span>
<span class="s0">before the wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them</span>
<span class="s0">to flight; may they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the</span>
<span class="s0">plots they have laid in secret be turned against them; let them fall</span>
<span class="s0">before Thy servants' feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art</span>
<span class="s0">able to save both great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot</span>
<span class="s0">prevail against Thee!</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and</span>
<span class="s0">loving-kindness which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us,</span>
<span class="s0">but be gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy</span>
<span class="s0">many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities! Create in</span>
<span class="s0">us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us, strengthen us all</span>
<span class="s0">in Thy faith, fortify our hope, inspire us with true love one for</span>
<span class="s0">another, arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the</span>
<span class="s0">heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers, and let not the scepter</span>
<span class="s0">of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast</span>
<span class="s0">sanctified.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust,</span>
<span class="s0">let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token</span>
<span class="s0">of Thy blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see</span>
<span class="s0">it and be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that</span>
<span class="s0">Thou art the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this</span>
<span class="s0">day, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy</span>
<span class="s0">servants to rejoice in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy</span>
<span class="s0">them swiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art</span>
<span class="s0">the defense, the succor, and the victory of them that put their</span>
<span class="s0">trust in Thee, and to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and Holy</span>
<span class="s0">Ghost, now and forever, world without end. Amen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In Natasha's receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her</span>
<span class="s0">strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over</span>
<span class="s0">Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about</span>
<span class="s0">the destruction of &quot;Thy Jerusalem,&quot; and she prayed to God with the</span>
<span class="s0">tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but</span>
<span class="s0">without fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer.</span>
<span class="s0">She shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of</span>
<span class="s0">righteousness, for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope,</span>
<span class="s0">and its animation by love. But she could not pray that her enemies</span>
<span class="s0">might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had</span>
<span class="s0">been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them. But</span>
<span class="s0">neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being</span>
<span class="s0">read on bended knees. She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe</span>
<span class="s0">at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins,</span>
<span class="s0">and especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God to forgive</span>
<span class="s0">them all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace and</span>
<span class="s0">happiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs' with</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was</span>
<span class="s0">appearing on his own horizon--from that day the problem of the</span>
<span class="s0">vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly</span>
<span class="s0">tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Wherefore?&quot; which had come to him amid every occupation, was</span>
<span class="s0">now replaced, not by another question or by a reply to the former</span>
<span class="s0">question, but by her image. When he listened to, or himself took</span>
<span class="s0">part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human</span>
<span class="s0">baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask</span>
<span class="s0">himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so</span>
<span class="s0">transient and incomprehensible--but he remembered her as he had last</span>
<span class="s0">seen her, and all his doubts vanished--not because she had answered</span>
<span class="s0">the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of</span>
<span class="s0">her transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of</span>
<span class="s0">spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty--a</span>
<span class="s0">realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever</span>
<span class="s0">worldly baseness presented itself to him, he said to himself:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar, and the</span>
<span class="s0">country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter?</span>
<span class="s0">She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her,</span>
<span class="s0">and no one will ever know it.&quot; And his soul felt calm and peaceful.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same</span>
<span class="s0">idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs' there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the</span>
<span class="s0">habits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that</span>
<span class="s0">bore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more</span>
<span class="s0">disquieting reports came from the seat of war and Natasha's health</span>
<span class="s0">began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling</span>
<span class="s0">of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not</span>
<span class="s0">explain, took possession of him. He felt that the condition he was</span>
<span class="s0">in could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which</span>
<span class="s0">would change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere</span>
<span class="s0">for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons</span>
<span class="s0">had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon,</span>
<span class="s0">drawn from the Revelation of St. John.</span>

<span class="s0">In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:</span>


<span class="s0">Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number</span>
<span class="s0">of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six</span>
<span class="s0">hundred threescore and six.</span>

<span class="s0">And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:</span>


<span class="s0">And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and</span>
<span class="s0">blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two</span>
<span class="s0">months.</span>


<span class="s0">The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as</span>
<span class="s0">the Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the</span>
<span class="s0">others tens, will have the following significance:</span>

      <span class="s0">a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k</span>
      <span class="s0">1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10</span>
       <span class="s0">l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s</span>
      <span class="s0">20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90</span>
             <span class="s0">t    u    v    w    x    y</span>
            <span class="s0">100  110  120  130  140  150</span>
                        <span class="s0">z</span>
                       <span class="s0">160</span>


<span class="s0">Writing the words L'Empereur Napoleon in numbers, it appears that</span>
<span class="s0">the sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon therefore the beast foretold</span>
<span class="s0">in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the</span>
<span class="s0">words quarante-deux,* which was the term allowed to the beast that</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;spoke great things and blasphemies,&quot; the same number 666 was</span>
<span class="s0">obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">power had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two.</span>
<span class="s0">This prophecy pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what</span>
<span class="s0">would put an end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon,</span>
<span class="s0">and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding</span>
<span class="s0">them up, to find an answer to the question that engrossed him. He</span>
<span class="s0">wrote the words L'Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up</span>
<span class="s0">their numbers, but the sums were either more or less than 666. Once</span>
<span class="s0">when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in French,</span>
<span class="s0">Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come right.</span>
<span class="s0">Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z for the s and adding de</span>
<span class="s0">and the article le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then</span>
<span class="s0">it occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in</span>
<span class="s0">his name, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So he</span>
<span class="s0">wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was</span>
<span class="s0">only five too much, and five was represented by e, the very letter</span>
<span class="s0">elided from the article le before the word Empereur. By omitting the</span>
<span class="s0">e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L'russe</span>
<span class="s0">Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means,</span>
<span class="s0">he was connected with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he</span>
<span class="s0">did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for a moment. His</span>
<span class="s0">love for Natasha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the comet,</span>
<span class="s0">666, L'Empereur Napoleon, and L'russe Besuhof--all this had to</span>
<span class="s0">mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere</span>
<span class="s0">of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to</span>
<span class="s0">a great achievement and great happiness.</span>


<span class="s0">*Forty-two.</span>



<span class="s0">On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">had promised the Rostovs to bring them, from Count Rostopchin whom</span>
<span class="s0">he knew well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the</span>
<span class="s0">army. In the morning, when he went to call at Rostopchin's he met</span>
<span class="s0">there a courier fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who</span>
<span class="s0">often danced at Moscow balls.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do, please, for heaven's sake, relieve me of something!&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">courier. &quot;I have a sackful of letters to parents.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostov to his father.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre took that letter, and Rostopchin also gave him the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">appeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders,</span>
<span class="s0">and his own most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and</span>
<span class="s0">rewarded, the name of Nicholas Rostov, awarded a St. George's Cross of</span>
<span class="s0">the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostrovna affair, and in</span>
<span class="s0">the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkonski, appointed to the</span>
<span class="s0">command of a regiment of Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind</span>
<span class="s0">the Rostovs of Bolkonski, Pierre could not refrain from making them</span>
<span class="s0">happy by the news of their son's having received a decoration, so he</span>
<span class="s0">sent that printed army order and Nicholas' letter to the Rostovs,</span>
<span class="s0">keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other orders to take with</span>
<span class="s0">him when he went to dinner.</span>

<span class="s0">His conversation with Count Rostopchin and the latter's tone of</span>
<span class="s0">anxious hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how</span>
<span class="s0">badly things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of</span>
<span class="s0">spies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn,</span>
<span class="s0">and the talk of the Emperor's being expected to arrive next day--all</span>
<span class="s0">aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation</span>
<span class="s0">in Pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance</span>
<span class="s0">of the comet, and especially since the beginning of the war.</span>

<span class="s0">He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done</span>
<span class="s0">so had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society</span>
<span class="s0">of Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached</span>
<span class="s0">perpetual peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact</span>
<span class="s0">that when he saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform</span>
<span class="s0">and were talking patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step.</span>
<span class="s0">But the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the</span>
<span class="s0">army lay in the vague idea that he was L'russe Besuhof who had the</span>
<span class="s0">number of the beast, 666; that his part in the great affair of setting</span>
<span class="s0">a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous</span>
<span class="s0">things had been predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought</span>
<span class="s0">not to undertake anything, but wait for what was bound to come to</span>
<span class="s0">pass.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XX</span>


<span class="s0">A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostovs that day, as</span>
<span class="s0">usual on Sundays.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre came early so as to find them alone.</span>

<span class="s0">He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had</span>
<span class="s0">he not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried</span>
<span class="s0">his bulk with evident ease.</span>

<span class="s0">He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman</span>
<span class="s0">did not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his</span>
<span class="s0">master was at the Rostovs' he stayed till midnight. The Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take</span>
<span class="s0">his hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and</span>
<span class="s0">stick in the anteroom.</span>

<span class="s0">The first person he saw in the house was Natasha. Even before he saw</span>
<span class="s0">her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing</span>
<span class="s0">solfa exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since</span>
<span class="s0">her illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted</span>
<span class="s0">him. He opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had</span>
<span class="s0">worn at church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to</span>
<span class="s0">him when he opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his</span>
<span class="s0">broad, surprised face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I want to try to sing again,&quot; she said, adding as if by way of</span>
<span class="s0">excuse, &quot;it is, at least, something to do.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's capital!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How glad I am you've come! I am so happy today,&quot; she said, with the</span>
<span class="s0">old animation Pierre had not seen in her for along time. &quot;You know</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas has received a St. George's Cross? I am so proud of him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don't want to interrupt</span>
<span class="s0">you,&quot; he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha stopped him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Count, is it wrong of me to sing?&quot; she said blushing, and fixing</span>
<span class="s0">her eyes inquiringly on him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know myself,&quot; Natasha answered quickly, &quot;but I should not</span>
<span class="s0">like to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely.</span>
<span class="s0">You don't know how important you are to me, how much you've done for</span>
<span class="s0">me....&quot; She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her</span>
<span class="s0">words. &quot;I saw in that same army order that he, Bolkonski&quot; (she</span>
<span class="s0">whispered the name hastily), &quot;is in Russia, and in the army again.</span>
<span class="s0">What do you think?&quot;--she was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid</span>
<span class="s0">her strength might fail her--&quot;Will he ever forgive me? Will he not</span>
<span class="s0">always have a bitter feeling toward me? What do you think? What do you</span>
<span class="s0">think?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think...&quot; Pierre replied, &quot;that he has nothing to forgive....</span>
<span class="s0">If I were in his place...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the</span>
<span class="s0">day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not</span>
<span class="s0">himself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his</span>
<span class="s0">knees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love</span>
<span class="s0">took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she</span>
<span class="s0">did not give him time to say them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, you... you...&quot; she said, uttering the word you rapturously-</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;that's a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or</span>
<span class="s0">better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now</span>
<span class="s0">too, I don't know what would have become of me, because...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music</span>
<span class="s0">before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and</span>
<span class="s0">down the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Just then Petya came running in from the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips</span>
<span class="s0">and resembled Natasha. He was preparing to enter the university, but</span>
<span class="s0">he and his friend Obolenski had lately, in secret, agreed to join</span>
<span class="s0">the hussars.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this</span>
<span class="s0">affair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted</span>
<span class="s0">in the hussars.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what</span>
<span class="s0">Petya was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirilych, for heaven's sake! You</span>
<span class="s0">are my only hope,&quot; said Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I'll mention it, I'll bring</span>
<span class="s0">it all up today.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?&quot; asked the old count.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The countess has been to Mass at the Razumovskis' and heard the new</span>
<span class="s0">prayer. She says it's very fine.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I've got it,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;The Emperor is to be here</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow... there's to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility,</span>
<span class="s0">and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me</span>
<span class="s0">congratulate you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We are again retreating. They say we're already near Smolensk,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">replied Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord, O Lord!&quot; exclaimed the count. &quot;Where is the manifesto?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor's appeal? Oh yes!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not</span>
<span class="s0">find them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the</span>
<span class="s0">countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">expecting Natasha, who had left off singing but had not yet come</span>
<span class="s0">into the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On my word, I don't know what I've done with it,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There he is, always losing everything!&quot; remarked the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face</span>
<span class="s0">and sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and</span>
<span class="s0">while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, really! I'll drive home, I must have left them there. I'll</span>
<span class="s0">certainly...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you'll be late for dinner.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh! And my coachman has gone.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But Sonya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom,</span>
<span class="s0">had found them in Pierre's hat, where he had carefully tucked them</span>
<span class="s0">under the lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, after dinner,&quot; said the old count, evidently expecting much</span>
<span class="s0">enjoyment from that reading.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new</span>
<span class="s0">chevalier of St. George, Shinshin told them the town news, of the</span>
<span class="s0">illness of the old Georgian princess, of Metivier's disappearance from</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchin</span>
<span class="s0">and accused of being a French &quot;spyer&quot; (so Count Rostopchin had told</span>
<span class="s0">the story), and how Rostopchin let him go and assured the people</span>
<span class="s0">that he was &quot;not a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;People are being arrested...&quot; said the count. &quot;I've told the</span>
<span class="s0">countess she should not speak French so much. It's not the time for it</span>
<span class="s0">now.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And have you heard?&quot; Shinshin asked. &quot;Prince Golitsyn has engaged a</span>
<span class="s0">master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak</span>
<span class="s0">French in the streets.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how about you, Count Peter Kirilych? If they call up the</span>
<span class="s0">militia, you too will have to mount a horse,&quot; remarked the old</span>
<span class="s0">count, addressing Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming</span>
<span class="s0">not to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, the war,&quot; he said. &quot;No! What sort of warrior should I make?</span>
<span class="s0">And yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can't make it out. I</span>
<span class="s0">don't know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these</span>
<span class="s0">times no one can answer for himself.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy</span>
<span class="s0">chair and with a serious face asked Sonya, who was considered an</span>
<span class="s0">excellent reader, to read the appeal.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;To Moscow, our ancient Capital!</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He</span>
<span class="s0">comes to despoil our beloved country,&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Sonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count</span>
<span class="s0">listened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father</span>
<span class="s0">and now at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The</span>
<span class="s0">countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn</span>
<span class="s0">expression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that</span>
<span class="s0">the danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshin,</span>
<span class="s0">with a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make</span>
<span class="s0">fun of anything that gave him the opportunity: Sonya's reading, any</span>
<span class="s0">remark of the count's, or even the manifesto itself should no better</span>
<span class="s0">pretext present itself.</span>

<span class="s0">After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious</span>
<span class="s0">nobility, Sonya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the</span>
<span class="s0">attention that was being paid to her, read the last words:</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that</span>
<span class="s0">Capital and in others parts of our realm for consultation, and for the</span>
<span class="s0">direction of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy's path</span>
<span class="s0">and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the</span>
<span class="s0">ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may</span>
<span class="s0">Europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, that's it!&quot; cried the count, opening his moist eyes and</span>
<span class="s0">sniffing repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his</span>
<span class="s0">nose; and he added, &quot;Let the Emperor but say the word and we'll</span>
<span class="s0">sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on</span>
<span class="s0">the count's patriotism, Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to</span>
<span class="s0">her father.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a darling our Papa is!&quot; she cried, kissing him, and she</span>
<span class="s0">again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned</span>
<span class="s0">to her with her better spirits.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There! Here's a patriot for you!&quot; said Shinshin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not a patriot at all, but simply...&quot; Natasha replied in an</span>
<span class="s0">injured tone. &quot;Everything seems funny to you, but this isn't at all</span>
<span class="s0">a joke....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A joke indeed!&quot; put in the count. &quot;Let him but say the word and</span>
<span class="s0">we'll all go.... We're not Germans!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But did you notice, it says, 'for consultation'?&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Never mind what it's for....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At this moment, Petya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came</span>
<span class="s0">up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking</span>
<span class="s0">voice that was now deep and now shrill:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it's as you</span>
<span class="s0">please, but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army,</span>
<span class="s0">because I can't... that's all....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and</span>
<span class="s0">turned angrily to her husband.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That comes of your talking!&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">But the count had already recovered from his excitement.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come, come!&quot; said he. &quot;Here's a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You</span>
<span class="s0">must study.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's not nonsense, Papa. Fedya Obolenski is younger than I, and</span>
<span class="s0">he's going too. Besides, all the same I can't study now when...&quot; Petya</span>
<span class="s0">stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;when our Fatherland is in danger.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That'll do, that'll do--nonsense....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Petya! Be quiet, I tell you!&quot; cried the count, with a glance at his</span>
<span class="s0">wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I tell you--Peter Kirilych here will also tell you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother's milk has hardly dried on your</span>
<span class="s0">lips and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and the count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably</span>
<span class="s0">to reread them in his study before having a nap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Peter Kirilych, let's go and have a smoke,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was agitated and undecided. Natasha's unwontedly brilliant</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had</span>
<span class="s0">reduced him to this condition.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I think I'll go home.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don't</span>
<span class="s0">often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,&quot; said the count</span>
<span class="s0">good-naturedly, pointing to Natasha, &quot;only brightens up when you're</span>
<span class="s0">here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Pierre hurriedly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, au revoir!&quot; said the count, and went out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why are you going? Why are you upset?&quot; asked Natasha, and she</span>
<span class="s0">looked challengingly into Pierre's eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because I love you!&quot; was what he wanted to say, but he did not</span>
<span class="s0">say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No,</span>
<span class="s0">simply I have business....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why? No, tell me!&quot; Natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He</span>
<span class="s0">tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he</span>
<span class="s0">silently kissed her hand and went out.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostovs' any more.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXI</span>


<span class="s0">After the definite refusal he had received, Petya went to his room</span>
<span class="s0">and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,</span>
<span class="s0">silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to</span>
<span class="s0">notice anything.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs' domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him.</span>
<span class="s0">That morning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and</span>
<span class="s0">collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking</span>
<span class="s0">glass, gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without</span>
<span class="s0">saying a word to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back</span>
<span class="s0">door, trying to avoid notice. Petya decided to go straight to where</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting</span>
<span class="s0">(he imagined the Emperor to be always surrounded by</span>
<span class="s0">gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostov, in spite of his youth</span>
<span class="s0">wished to serve his country; that youth could be no hindrance to</span>
<span class="s0">loyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing, Petya had</span>
<span class="s0">prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting.</span>

<span class="s0">It was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted for</span>
<span class="s0">success in reaching the Emperor--he even thought how surprised</span>
<span class="s0">everyone would be at his youthfulness--and yet in the arrangement of</span>
<span class="s0">his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to</span>
<span class="s0">appear a grown-up man. But the farther he went and the more his</span>
<span class="s0">attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the</span>
<span class="s0">Kremlin, the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and</span>
<span class="s0">deliberation of a man. As he approached the Kremlin he even began to</span>
<span class="s0">avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a</span>
<span class="s0">menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to</span>
<span class="s0">the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic</span>
<span class="s0">intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his</span>
<span class="s0">determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,</span>
<span class="s0">rumbling beneath the archway. Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a</span>
<span class="s0">footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing</span>
<span class="s0">some time in the gateway, Petya tried to move forward in front of</span>
<span class="s0">the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began</span>
<span class="s0">resolutely working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in</span>
<span class="s0">front of him, who was the first against whom he directed his</span>
<span class="s0">efforts, angrily shouted at him:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don't you see we're all</span>
<span class="s0">standing still? Then why push?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Anybody can shove,&quot; said the footman, and also began working his</span>
<span class="s0">elbows to such effect that he pushed Petya into a very filthy corner</span>
<span class="s0">of the gateway.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the</span>
<span class="s0">damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a</span>
<span class="s0">man's.</span>

<span class="s0">He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if</span>
<span class="s0">he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he</span>
<span class="s0">would not be admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten</span>
<span class="s0">oneself up or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of</span>
<span class="s0">the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostovs', and</span>
<span class="s0">Petya thought of asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that</span>
<span class="s0">would not be a manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed</span>
<span class="s0">in, the crowd, carrying Petya with it, streamed forward into the</span>
<span class="s0">Kremlin Square which was already full of people. There were people not</span>
<span class="s0">only in the square, but everywhere--on the slopes and on the roofs. As</span>
<span class="s0">soon as Petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound</span>
<span class="s0">of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole</span>
<span class="s0">Kremlin.</span>

<span class="s0">For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were</span>
<span class="s0">bared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Petya was being</span>
<span class="s0">pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&quot; Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and</span>
<span class="s0">pinched, but could see nothing except the people about him.</span>

<span class="s0">All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm.</span>
<span class="s0">A tradesman's wife standing beside Petya sobbed, and the tears ran</span>
<span class="s0">down her cheeks.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Father! Angel! Dear one!&quot; she kept repeating, wiping away her tears</span>
<span class="s0">with her fingers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hurrah!&quot; was heard on all sides.</span>

<span class="s0">For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush</span>
<span class="s0">forward.</span>

<span class="s0">Quite beside himself, Petya, clinching his teeth and rolling his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;hurrah!&quot; as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and</span>
<span class="s0">everyone else, but on both sides of him other people with similarly</span>
<span class="s0">ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted &quot;hurrah!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So this is what the Emperor is!&quot; thought Petya. &quot;No, I can't</span>
<span class="s0">petition him myself--that would be too bold.&quot; But in spite of this</span>
<span class="s0">he continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the</span>
<span class="s0">backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a</span>
<span class="s0">strip of red cloth spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed</span>
<span class="s0">back--the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed</span>
<span class="s0">too close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace</span>
<span class="s0">to the Cathedral of the Assumption--and Petya unexpectedly received</span>
<span class="s0">such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance</span>
<span class="s0">with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a</span>
<span class="s0">shabby blue cassock--probably a church clerk and chanter--was</span>
<span class="s0">holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure</span>
<span class="s0">of the crowd with the other.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You've crushed the young gentleman!&quot; said the clerk. &quot;What are</span>
<span class="s0">you up to? Gently!... They've crushed him, crushed him!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd</span>
<span class="s0">spread out again more evenly, and the clerk led Petya--pale and</span>
<span class="s0">breathless--to the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Petya,</span>
<span class="s0">and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those</span>
<span class="s0">who stood nearest him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him</span>
<span class="s0">on the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached those others</span>
<span class="s0">(whoever they might be) who had crushed him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it?</span>
<span class="s0">Killing people! Poor dear, he's as white as a sheet!&quot;--various</span>
<span class="s0">voices were heard saying.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain</span>
<span class="s0">had passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had</span>
<span class="s0">obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor who would be returning that way. Petya no longer thought of</span>
<span class="s0">presenting his petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would</span>
<span class="s0">be happy!</span>

<span class="s0">While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption-</span>
<span class="s0">it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the</span>
<span class="s0">Turks--the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling</span>
<span class="s0">kvas, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Petya was</span>
<span class="s0">particularly fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard.</span>
<span class="s0">A tradesman's wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how</span>
<span class="s0">much the shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had</span>
<span class="s0">now got dear. The clerk who had rescued Petya was talking to a</span>
<span class="s0">functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the</span>
<span class="s0">bishop. The clerk several times used the word &quot;plenary&quot; (of the</span>
<span class="s0">service), a word Petya did not understand. Two young citizens were</span>
<span class="s0">joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these</span>
<span class="s0">conversations, especially the joking with the girls, were such as</span>
<span class="s0">might have had a particular charm for Petya at his age, but they did</span>
<span class="s0">not interest him now. He sat on his elevation--the pedestal of the</span>
<span class="s0">cannon--still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and</span>
<span class="s0">by his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced</span>
<span class="s0">when he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still</span>
<span class="s0">further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the</span>
<span class="s0">embankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and</span>
<span class="s0">the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the</span>
<span class="s0">firing. Petya too would have run there, but the clerk who had taken</span>
<span class="s0">the young gentleman under his protection stopped him. The firing was</span>
<span class="s0">still proceeding when officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting</span>
<span class="s0">came running out of the cathedral, and after them others in a more</span>
<span class="s0">leisurely manner: caps were again raised, and those who had run to</span>
<span class="s0">look at the cannon ran back again. At last four men in uniforms and</span>
<span class="s0">sashes emerged from the cathedral doors. &quot;Hurrah! hurrah!&quot; shouted the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Which is he? Which?&quot; asked Petya in a tearful voice, of those</span>
<span class="s0">around him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and</span>
<span class="s0">Petya, fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly</span>
<span class="s0">see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiasm on him--though it happened not to be the Emperor-</span>
<span class="s0">frantically shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and resolved that tomorrow, come what</span>
<span class="s0">might, he would join the army.</span>

<span class="s0">The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and</span>
<span class="s0">began to disperse. It was already late, and Petya had not eaten</span>
<span class="s0">anything and was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home</span>
<span class="s0">but stood with that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd</span>
<span class="s0">before the palace while the Emperor dined--looking in at the palace</span>
<span class="s0">windows, expecting he knew not what, and envying alike the notables he</span>
<span class="s0">saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court</span>
<span class="s0">footmen who served at table, glimpses of whom could be seen through</span>
<span class="s0">the windows.</span>

<span class="s0">While the Emperor was dining, Valuev, looking out of the window,</span>
<span class="s0">said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit,</span>
<span class="s0">rose and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Petya among them,</span>
<span class="s0">rushed toward the balcony.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...&quot; cried the crowd, and Petya</span>
<span class="s0">with it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Petya among them,</span>
<span class="s0">wept with joy.</span>

<span class="s0">A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand</span>
<span class="s0">broke off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A</span>
<span class="s0">coachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched</span>
<span class="s0">it up. Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began</span>
<span class="s0">throwing them down from the balcony. Petya's eyes grew bloodshot,</span>
<span class="s0">and still more excited by the danger of being crushed, he rushed at</span>
<span class="s0">the biscuits. He did not know why, but he had to have a biscuit from</span>
<span class="s0">the Tsar's hand and he felt that he must not give way. He sprang</span>
<span class="s0">forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit; the</span>
<span class="s0">old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on</span>
<span class="s0">the ground--she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach</span>
<span class="s0">them. Petya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a biscuit,</span>
<span class="s0">and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; with a voice</span>
<span class="s0">already hoarse.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd</span>
<span class="s0">began to disperse.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There! I said if only we waited--and so it was!&quot; was being joyfully</span>
<span class="s0">said by various people.</span>

<span class="s0">Happy as Petya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that</span>
<span class="s0">all the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home</span>
<span class="s0">from the Kremlin, but called on his friend Obolenski, who was</span>
<span class="s0">fifteen and was also entering the regiment. On returning home Petya</span>
<span class="s0">announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter</span>
<span class="s0">the service he would run away. And next day, Count Ilya Rostov--though</span>
<span class="s0">he had not yet quite yielded--went to inquire how he could arrange for</span>
<span class="s0">Petya to serve where there would be least danger.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXII</span>


<span class="s0">Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of</span>
<span class="s0">carriages were standing outside the Sloboda Palace.</span>

<span class="s0">The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry</span>
<span class="s0">in their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted</span>
<span class="s0">coats of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen's hall there</span>
<span class="s0">was an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat</span>
<span class="s0">on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.</span>

<span class="s0">All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in</span>
<span class="s0">their own houses, were in uniform--some in that of Catherine's day,</span>
<span class="s0">others in that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander's time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the</span>
<span class="s0">general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something</span>
<span class="s0">strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities,</span>
<span class="s0">both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow,</span>
<span class="s0">and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially striking. For</span>
<span class="s0">the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, or, if</span>
<span class="s0">they walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone</span>
<span class="s0">younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Petya had</span>
<span class="s0">seen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the general</span>
<span class="s0">expectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the everyday</span>
<span class="s0">interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zinaida Dmitrievna's</span>
<span class="s0">health, and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a</span>
<span class="s0">nobleman's uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated;</span>
<span class="s0">this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the</span>
<span class="s0">merchant-class--les etats generaux (States-General)--evoked in him a</span>
<span class="s0">whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply</span>
<span class="s0">graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat social and the French</span>
<span class="s0">Revolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor's appeal-</span>
<span class="s0">that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his</span>
<span class="s0">people--strengthened this idea. And imagining that in this direction</span>
<span class="s0">something important which he had long awaited was drawing near, he</span>
<span class="s0">strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but nowhere</span>
<span class="s0">finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor's manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all</span>
<span class="s0">moved about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of</span>
<span class="s0">conversation, Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the</span>
<span class="s0">nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered, when a ball should be</span>
<span class="s0">given in the Emperor's honor, whether they should group themselves</span>
<span class="s0">by districts or by whole provinces... and so on; but as soon as the</span>
<span class="s0">war was touched on, or what the nobility had been convened for, the</span>
<span class="s0">talk became undecided and indefinite. Then all preferred listening</span>
<span class="s0">to speaking.</span>

<span class="s0">A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a</span>
<span class="s0">retired naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small</span>
<span class="s0">crowd was pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had</span>
<span class="s0">formed round the speaker and listened. Count Ilya Rostov, in a</span>
<span class="s0">military uniform of Catherine's time, was sauntering with a pleasant</span>
<span class="s0">smile among the crowd, with all of whom he was acquainted. He too</span>
<span class="s0">approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of</span>
<span class="s0">approval, as he always did, to what the speaker was saying. The</span>
<span class="s0">retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was evident from the</span>
<span class="s0">expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some</span>
<span class="s0">people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away</span>
<span class="s0">disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his</span>
<span class="s0">way into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that</span>
<span class="s0">the man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from his</span>
<span class="s0">own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical,</span>
<span class="s0">and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing his r's and</span>
<span class="s0">generally slurring his consonants: the voice of a man calling out to</span>
<span class="s0">his servant, &quot;Heah! Bwing me my pipe!&quot; It was indicative of</span>
<span class="s0">dissipation and the exercise of authority.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the</span>
<span class="s0">Empewah? Ah we to take Smolensk as our patte'n? If the noble</span>
<span class="s0">awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its</span>
<span class="s0">loyalty to our sov'weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we</span>
<span class="s0">fo'gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah 'seven? All that</span>
<span class="s0">did was to enwich the pwiests' sons and thieves and wobbahs....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Count Ilya Rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only</span>
<span class="s0">wuined our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o' ou' men</span>
<span class="s0">will wetu'n neithah soldiers no' peasants, and we'll get only</span>
<span class="s0">depwavity fwom them. The nobility don't gwudge theah lives--evewy</span>
<span class="s0">one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and the sov'weign&quot; (that</span>
<span class="s0">was the way he referred to the Emperor) &quot;need only say the word and</span>
<span class="s0">we'll all die fo' him!&quot; added the orator with animation.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostov's mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,</span>
<span class="s0">but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had</span>
<span class="s0">he opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in</span>
<span class="s0">his head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the</span>
<span class="s0">first speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing</span>
<span class="s0">debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct</span>
<span class="s0">tones:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I imagine, sir,&quot; said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it's best</span>
<span class="s0">for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to</span>
<span class="s0">call out the militia. We have been summoned to reply to the appeal</span>
<span class="s0">with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what</span>
<span class="s0">is best--conscription or the militia--we can leave to the supreme</span>
<span class="s0">authority....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his</span>
<span class="s0">heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow</span>
<span class="s0">attitude into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped</span>
<span class="s0">forward and interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would</span>
<span class="s0">say, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French</span>
<span class="s0">or expressing himself in bookish Russian.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Excuse me, your excellency,&quot; he began. (He was well acquainted with</span>
<span class="s0">the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address</span>
<span class="s0">him formally.) &quot;Though I don't agree with the gentleman...&quot; (he</span>
<span class="s0">hesitated: he wished to say, &quot;Mon tres honorable preopinant&quot;--&quot;My very</span>
<span class="s0">honorable opponent&quot;) &quot;with the gentleman... whom I have not the</span>
<span class="s0">honor of knowing, I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not</span>
<span class="s0">merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider</span>
<span class="s0">the means by which we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,&quot; he went</span>
<span class="s0">on, warming to his subject, &quot;that the Emperor himself would not be</span>
<span class="s0">satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing</span>
<span class="s0">to devote to his service, and chair a canon* we are ready to make of</span>
<span class="s0">ourselves--and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Food for cannon.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator's</span>
<span class="s0">sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre's remarks. Only Count Rostov</span>
<span class="s0">was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval</span>
<span class="s0">officer, the senator, and in general with whatever speech he had</span>
<span class="s0">last heard.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think that before discussing these questions,&quot; Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">continued, &quot;we should ask the Emperor--most respectfully ask His</span>
<span class="s0">Majesty--to let us know the number of our troops and the position in</span>
<span class="s0">which our army and our forces now are, and then...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked</span>
<span class="s0">from three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintance, a boston player who had always been well disposed toward</span>
<span class="s0">him, Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin. Adraksin was in uniform, and whether</span>
<span class="s0">as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw</span>
<span class="s0">before him quite a different man. With a sudden expression of</span>
<span class="s0">malevolence on his aged face, Adraksin shouted at Pierre:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that</span>
<span class="s0">right, the Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are</span>
<span class="s0">moved according to the enemy's movements and the number of men</span>
<span class="s0">increases and decreases...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty</span>
<span class="s0">years of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies' and knew as</span>
<span class="s0">a bad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, interrupted Adraksin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,&quot; he continued, &quot;but for</span>
<span class="s0">acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy</span>
<span class="s0">Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our</span>
<span class="s0">wives and children.&quot; The nobleman smote his breast. &quot;We will all</span>
<span class="s0">arise, every one of us will go, for our father the Tsar!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">shouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were</span>
<span class="s0">heard in the crowd. &quot;We are Russians and will not grudge our blood</span>
<span class="s0">in defense of our faith, the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease</span>
<span class="s0">raving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe how</span>
<span class="s0">Russia rises to the defense of Russia!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that</span>
<span class="s0">his words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible</span>
<span class="s0">than the sound of his opponent's voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval;</span>
<span class="s0">several persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end</span>
<span class="s0">of a phrase, said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's right, quite right! Just so!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his</span>
<span class="s0">serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in</span>
<span class="s0">order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many</span>
<span class="s0">voices shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostov had</span>
<span class="s0">not time to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased,</span>
<span class="s0">dispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the</span>
<span class="s0">largest hall and to the big table. Not only was Pierre's attempt to</span>
<span class="s0">speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and</span>
<span class="s0">people turned away from him as from a common enemy. This happened</span>
<span class="s0">not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech, which</span>
<span class="s0">had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches, but to</span>
<span class="s0">animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible</span>
<span class="s0">object to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other orators spoke</span>
<span class="s0">after the excited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke</span>
<span class="s0">eloquently and with originality.</span>

<span class="s0">Glinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized</span>
<span class="s0">(cries of &quot;author! author!&quot; were heard in the crowd), said that</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;hell must be repulsed by hell,&quot; and that he had seen a child</span>
<span class="s0">smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps, but &quot;we will not be</span>
<span class="s0">that child.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!&quot; was repeated approvingly in the back</span>
<span class="s0">rows of the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or</span>
<span class="s0">bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of</span>
<span class="s0">whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or</span>
<span class="s0">playing boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd</span>
<span class="s0">advanced to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of</span>
<span class="s0">the chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two</span>
<span class="s0">together. Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to</span>
<span class="s0">say and hastened to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked</span>
<span class="s0">their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it. The old</span>
<span class="s0">magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned to look first at one and</span>
<span class="s0">then at another, and their faces for the most part only expressed</span>
<span class="s0">the fact that they found it very hot. Pierre, however, felt excited,</span>
<span class="s0">and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all</span>
<span class="s0">lengths--which found expression in the tones and looks more than in</span>
<span class="s0">the substance of the speeches--infected him too. He did not renounce</span>
<span class="s0">his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to</span>
<span class="s0">justify himself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices</span>
<span class="s0">when we know what is needed!&quot; said he, trying to be heard above the</span>
<span class="s0">other voices.</span>

<span class="s0">One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention</span>
<span class="s0">was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the</span>
<span class="s0">table.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">shouted one man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is the enemy of mankind!&quot; cried another. &quot;Allow me to speak....&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIII</span>


<span class="s0">At that moment Count Rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder,</span>
<span class="s0">entered the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of</span>
<span class="s0">gentry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin. &quot;I am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are</span>
<span class="s0">in, I think there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has</span>
<span class="s0">deigned to summon us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth</span>
<span class="s0">from there&quot;--he pointed to the merchants' hall--&quot;but our business is</span>
<span class="s0">to supply men and not spare ourselves... That is the least we can do!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the</span>
<span class="s0">table. The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all</span>
<span class="s0">the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after</span>
<span class="s0">another, &quot;I agree,&quot; or for variety, &quot;I too am of that opinion,&quot; and so</span>
<span class="s0">on had even a mournful effect.</span>

<span class="s0">The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully</span>
<span class="s0">equipped, out of every thousand serfs, as the Smolensk gentry had</span>
<span class="s0">done. Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had</span>
<span class="s0">conferred rose with apparent relief, and began walking up and down,</span>
<span class="s0">arm in arm, to stretch their legs and converse in couples.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor! The Emperor!&quot; a sudden cry resounded through the halls</span>
<span class="s0">and the whole throng hurried to the entrance.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two</span>
<span class="s0">lines of nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck</span>
<span class="s0">curiosity. Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor said. From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he</span>
<span class="s0">placed on the Moscow nobility. He was answered by a voice which</span>
<span class="s0">informed him of the resolution just arrived at.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Gentlemen!&quot; said the Emperor with a quivering voice.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so</span>
<span class="s0">that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">saying with emotion:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it</span>
<span class="s0">has surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the</span>
<span class="s0">Fatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and</span>
<span class="s0">rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, most precious... a royal word,&quot; said Count Rostov, with a sob.</span>
<span class="s0">He stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything,</span>
<span class="s0">understood everything in his own way.</span>

<span class="s0">From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the</span>
<span class="s0">merchants. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those</span>
<span class="s0">who saw him come out from the merchants' hall with tears of emotion in</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes. As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address</span>
<span class="s0">the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in</span>
<span class="s0">a trembling voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied by two merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat</span>
<span class="s0">otkupshchik. The other was the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face</span>
<span class="s0">and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled the thin man's eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept</span>
<span class="s0">repeating:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Our lives and property--take them, Your Majesty!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he</span>
<span class="s0">was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">everything. He now felt ashamed of his speech with its</span>
<span class="s0">constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it.</span>
<span class="s0">Having heard that Count Mamonov was furnishing a regiment, Bezukhov at</span>
<span class="s0">once informed Rostopchin that he would give a thousand men and their</span>
<span class="s0">maintenance.</span>

<span class="s0">Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears,</span>
<span class="s0">and at once consented to Petya's request and went himself to enter his</span>
<span class="s0">name.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took</span>
<span class="s0">off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs,</span>
<span class="s0">and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the</span>
<span class="s0">enrollment, feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK TEN: 1812</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going</span>
<span class="s0">to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he</span>
<span class="s0">received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to</span>
<span class="s0">the stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain</span>
<span class="s0">from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and then of Balashev.</span>

<span class="s0">Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be</span>
<span class="s0">personally insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the</span>
<span class="s0">best way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a</span>
<span class="s0">great commander. Rostov charged the French because he could not</span>
<span class="s0">restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same</span>
<span class="s0">way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord</span>
<span class="s0">with their personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and</span>
<span class="s0">aims. They were moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant,</span>
<span class="s0">reasoned, imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it</span>
<span class="s0">of their own free will, but they all were involuntary tools of</span>
<span class="s0">history, carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible</span>
<span class="s0">to us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and the higher</span>
<span class="s0">they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.</span>

<span class="s0">The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal</span>
<span class="s0">interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of</span>
<span class="s0">that time but its historic results.</span>

<span class="s0">Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal</span>
<span class="s0">aims, to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of</span>
<span class="s0">them at all expected--neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still</span>
<span class="s0">less any of those who did the actual fighting.</span>

<span class="s0">The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear</span>
<span class="s0">to us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand,</span>
<span class="s0">its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any</span>
<span class="s0">preparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, the character</span>
<span class="s0">given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the</span>
<span class="s0">foe this aroused among the Russian people. But no one at the time</span>
<span class="s0">foresaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army</span>
<span class="s0">of eight hundred thousand men--the best in the world and led by the</span>
<span class="s0">best general--could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half</span>
<span class="s0">its numerical strength, and led by inexperienced commanders as the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian army was. Not only did no one see this, but on the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save</span>
<span class="s0">Russia, while on the French side, despite Napoleon's experience and</span>
<span class="s0">so-called military genius, every effort was directed to pushing on</span>
<span class="s0">to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing</span>
<span class="s0">that was bound to lead to destruction.</span>

<span class="s0">In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of</span>
<span class="s0">saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he</span>
<span class="s0">sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk,</span>
<span class="s0">and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the</span>
<span class="s0">campaign was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of</span>
<span class="s0">telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war</span>
<span class="s0">plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and</span>
<span class="s0">this plan some of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman, others to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself-</span>
<span class="s0">pointing to notes, projects, and letters which contain hints of such a</span>

<span class="s0">line of action. But all these hints at what happened, both from the</span>
<span class="s0">French side and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in</span>
<span class="s0">with the event. Had that event not occurred these hints would have</span>
<span class="s0">been forgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of</span>
<span class="s0">hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but</span>
<span class="s0">have now been forgotten because the event falsified them. There are</span>
<span class="s0">always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however</span>
<span class="s0">it may end there will always be people to say: &quot;I said then that it</span>
<span class="s0">would be so,&quot; quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures</span>
<span class="s0">many were to quite the contrary effect.</span>

<span class="s0">Conjectures as to Napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending</span>
<span class="s0">his line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the</span>
<span class="s0">depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much</span>
<span class="s0">straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and</span>
<span class="s0">his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts</span>
<span class="s0">are in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period</span>
<span class="s0">of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw</span>
<span class="s0">the French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry</span>
<span class="s0">into Russia everything was done to stop them. And not only was</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step</span>
<span class="s0">forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former</span>
<span class="s0">campaigns, but very lazily.</span>

<span class="s0">At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our</span>
<span class="s0">sole aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage</span>
<span class="s0">if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the</span>
<span class="s0">country. Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every</span>
<span class="s0">inch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp</span>
<span class="s0">was formed on Pfuel's plan, and there was no intention of retiring</span>
<span class="s0">farther. The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step</span>
<span class="s0">they retired. He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even</span>
<span class="s0">reach Smolensk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smolensk was</span>
<span class="s0">abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought</span>
<span class="s0">under its walls.</span>

<span class="s0">So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were</span>
<span class="s0">still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating</span>
<span class="s0">into the depths of the country.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country</span>
<span class="s0">and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he</span>
<span class="s0">was at Smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther, though</span>
<span class="s0">as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.</span>

<span class="s0">The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of</span>
<span class="s0">the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders</span>
<span class="s0">then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring</span>
<span class="s0">of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any</span>
<span class="s0">plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most</span>
<span class="s0">complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who</span>
<span class="s0">took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable,</span>
<span class="s0">or of the one way of saving Russia. Everything came about</span>
<span class="s0">fortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the</span>
<span class="s0">campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving</span>
<span class="s0">battle and checking the enemy's advance, and by this effort to unite</span>
<span class="s0">them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily</span>
<span class="s0">withdrawing the armies at an acute angle--we led the French on to</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the</span>
<span class="s0">French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more</span>
<span class="s0">acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an</span>
<span class="s0">unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagration (who would come his</span>
<span class="s0">command), and Bagration--being in command of the second army--tried to</span>
<span class="s0">postpone joining up and coming under Barclay's command as long as he</span>
<span class="s0">could. Bagration was slow in effecting the junction--though that was</span>
<span class="s0">the chief aim of all at headquarters--because, as he alleged, he</span>
<span class="s0">exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to</span>
<span class="s0">retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from</span>
<span class="s0">flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army;</span>
<span class="s0">and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the</span>
<span class="s0">command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior</span>
<span class="s0">to his own.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence</span>
<span class="s0">and ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of</span>
<span class="s0">advisers and plans, destroyed the first army's energy and it retired.</span>

<span class="s0">The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but</span>
<span class="s0">Paulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed</span>
<span class="s0">his energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel's whole plan was</span>
<span class="s0">abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not</span>
<span class="s0">inspire confidence his power was limited. The armies were divided,</span>
<span class="s0">there was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from</span>
<span class="s0">this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and</span>
<span class="s0">the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from</span>
<span class="s0">had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay,</span>
<span class="s0">been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation</span>
<span class="s0">against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.</span>

<span class="s0">At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and</span>
<span class="s0">indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was</span>
<span class="s0">necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the</span>
<span class="s0">nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled.</span>

<span class="s0">He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief's</span>
<span class="s0">undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action</span>
<span class="s0">would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more</span>
<span class="s0">confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarevich, and a swarm of</span>
<span class="s0">adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in</span>
<span class="s0">chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling</span>
<span class="s0">less free than ever under the observation of all these &quot;eyes of the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor,&quot; became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive</span>
<span class="s0">action and avoided giving battle.</span>

<span class="s0">Barclay stood for caution. The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and</span>
<span class="s0">demanded a general engagement. Lubomirski, Bronnitski, Wlocki, and the</span>
<span class="s0">others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under</span>
<span class="s0">pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish</span>
<span class="s0">adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen and the Tsarevich.</span>

<span class="s0">At Smolensk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagration</span>
<span class="s0">disliked it.</span>

<span class="s0">Bagration drove up in a carriage to to the house occupied by</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay. Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to</span>
<span class="s0">his senior officer Bagration.</span>

<span class="s0">Despite his seniority in rank Bagration, in this contest of</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimity, took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted,</span>
<span class="s0">agreed with him less than ever. By the Emperor's orders Bagration</span>
<span class="s0">reported direct to him. He wrote to Arakcheev, the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">confidant: &quot;It must be as my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with</span>
<span class="s0">the Minister (meaning Barclay). For God's sake send me somewhere</span>
<span class="s0">else if only in command of a regiment. I cannot stand it here.</span>
<span class="s0">Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist and</span>
<span class="s0">there is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving my</span>
<span class="s0">sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay. I confess I do not want to.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The swarm of Bronnitskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still</span>
<span class="s0">further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief,</span>
<span class="s0">and even less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the</span>
<span class="s0">French before Smolensk. A general was sent to survey the position.</span>
<span class="s0">This general, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a</span>
<span class="s0">corps commander, and, having spent the day with him, returned to</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay and condemned, as unsuitable from every point of view, the</span>
<span class="s0">battleground he had not seen.</span>

<span class="s0">While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of</span>
<span class="s0">battle, and while we were looking for the French--having lost touch</span>
<span class="s0">with them--the French stumbled upon Neverovski's division and</span>
<span class="s0">reached the walls of Smolensk.</span>

<span class="s0">It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk to save</span>
<span class="s0">our lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were</span>
<span class="s0">killed on both sides.</span>

<span class="s0">Smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and</span>
<span class="s0">of the whole people. But Smolensk was burned by its own</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants-who had been misled by their governor. And these ruined</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants, setting an example to other Russians, went to Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon advanced farther and we retired, thus arriving at the very</span>
<span class="s0">result which caused his destruction.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary to come to his study.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well? Are you satisfied now?&quot; said he. &quot;You've made me quarrel with</span>
<span class="s0">my son! Satisfied, are you? That's all you wanted! Satisfied?... It</span>
<span class="s0">hurts me, it hurts. I'm old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well</span>
<span class="s0">then, gloat over it! Gloat over it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He</span>
<span class="s0">was ill and did not leave his study.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the</span>
<span class="s0">old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne either. Tikhon alone attended him.</span>

<span class="s0">At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his</span>
<span class="s0">former way of life, devoting himself with special activity to building</span>
<span class="s0">operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely</span>
<span class="s0">breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks</span>
<span class="s0">and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say: &quot;There, you see? You</span>
<span class="s0">plotted against me, you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations</span>
<span class="s0">with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, but you see I need</span>
<span class="s0">neither her nor you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching</span>
<span class="s0">his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to</span>
<span class="s0">Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her</span>
<span class="s0">old nurse, or with &quot;God's folk&quot; who sometimes came by the back door to</span>
<span class="s0">see her.</span>

<span class="s0">Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She</span>
<span class="s0">feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at</span>
<span class="s0">the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did</span>
<span class="s0">not understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her</span>
<span class="s0">like all previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this</span>
<span class="s0">war, though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was</span>
<span class="s0">passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own</span>
<span class="s0">conception of it to her, and though the &quot;God's folk&quot; who came to see</span>
<span class="s0">her reported, in their own way, the rumors current among the people of</span>
<span class="s0">an invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie (now Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Drubetskaya), who had resumed correspondence with her, wrote patriotic</span>
<span class="s0">letters from Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I write you in Russian, my good friend,&quot; wrote Julie in her</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchified Russian, &quot;because I have a detestation for all the French,</span>
<span class="s0">and the same for their language which I cannot support to hear</span>
<span class="s0">spoken.... We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but</span>
<span class="s0">the news which I have inspires me yet more.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski, embracing</span>
<span class="s0">his two sons and saying: 'I will perish with them but we will not be</span>
<span class="s0">shaken!' And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we</span>
<span class="s0">were unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The</span>
<span class="s0">princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy</span>
<span class="s0">widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie,</span>
<span class="s0">only you, my friend, are missing...&quot; and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance</span>
<span class="s0">of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not</span>
<span class="s0">recognize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.</span>
<span class="s0">The prince's tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">unhesitatingly believed him.</span>

<span class="s0">All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even</span>
<span class="s0">animated. He planned another garden and began a new building for the</span>
<span class="s0">domestic serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about</span>
<span class="s0">him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his</span>
<span class="s0">study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would</span>
<span class="s0">order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he</span>
<span class="s0">remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and</span>
<span class="s0">dozed there without undressing, while--instead of Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne--a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night</span>
<span class="s0">in the dining room.</span>

<span class="s0">On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his</span>
<span class="s0">first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had</span>
<span class="s0">dutifully asked his father's forgiveness for what he had allowed</span>
<span class="s0">himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this</span>
<span class="s0">letter the old prince had replied affectionately, and from that time</span>
<span class="s0">had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew's second letter,</span>
<span class="s0">written near Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a</span>
<span class="s0">brief account of the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had</span>
<span class="s0">drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war. In this</span>
<span class="s0">letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying</span>
<span class="s0">at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on the army's direct</span>
<span class="s0">line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner that day, on Dessalles' mentioning that the French were</span>
<span class="s0">said to have already entered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered his</span>
<span class="s0">son's letter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,&quot; he said to Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary--&quot;Haven't you read it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, Father,&quot; she replied in a frightened voice.</span>

<span class="s0">She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had</span>
<span class="s0">arrived.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He writes about this war,&quot; said the prince, with the ironic smile</span>
<span class="s0">that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That must be very interesting,&quot; said Dessalles. &quot;Prince Andrew is</span>
<span class="s0">in a position to know...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, very interesting!&quot; said Mademoiselle Bourienne.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go and get it for me,&quot; said the old prince to Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne. &quot;You know--under the paperweight on the little table.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, don't!&quot; he exclaimed with a frown. &quot;You go, Michael Ivanovich.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he</span>
<span class="s0">had left the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down</span>
<span class="s0">his napkin and went himself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They can't do anything... always make some muddle,&quot; he muttered.</span>

<span class="s0">While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne, and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The</span>
<span class="s0">old prince returned with quick steps, accompanied by Michael</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovich, bringing the letter and a plan. These he put down beside</span>
<span class="s0">him--not letting anyone read them at dinner.</span>

<span class="s0">On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary and, spreading out before him the plan of the new building and</span>
<span class="s0">fixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she</span>
<span class="s0">had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was</span>
<span class="s0">examining the plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What do you think of it, Prince?&quot; Dessalles ventured to ask.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I? I?...&quot; said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not</span>
<span class="s0">taking his eyes from the plan of the building.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha ha ha! The theater of war!&quot; said the prince. &quot;I have said and</span>
<span class="s0">still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never</span>
<span class="s0">get beyond the Niemen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of</span>
<span class="s0">the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary, forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that</span>
<span class="s0">what her father was saying was correct.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When the snow melts they'll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they</span>
<span class="s0">could fail to see it,&quot; the prince continued, evidently thinking of the</span>
<span class="s0">campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. &quot;Bennigsen should have</span>
<span class="s0">advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different</span>
<span class="s0">turn...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But, Prince,&quot; Dessalles began timidly, &quot;the letter mentions</span>
<span class="s0">Vitebsk....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, the letter? Yes...&quot; replied the prince peevishly. &quot;Yes...</span>
<span class="s0">yes...&quot; His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river</span>
<span class="s0">is it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dessalles dropped his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The prince says nothing about that,&quot; he remarked gently.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Doesn't he? But I didn't invent it myself.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">No one spoke for a long time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivanovich,&quot; he suddenly went on,</span>
<span class="s0">raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building, &quot;tell me</span>
<span class="s0">how you mean to alter it....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking</span>
<span class="s0">to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and</span>
<span class="s0">Dessalles and went to his own room.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary saw Dessalles' embarrassed and astonished look fixed</span>
<span class="s0">on her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that</span>
<span class="s0">her father had forgotten his son's letter on the drawing-room table;</span>
<span class="s0">but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the</span>
<span class="s0">reason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think</span>
<span class="s0">about it.</span>

<span class="s0">In the evening Michael Ivanovich, sent by the prince, came to</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary for Prince Andrew's letter which had been forgotten in</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to</span>
<span class="s0">her to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Always busy,&quot; replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully</span>
<span class="s0">ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. &quot;He's worrying</span>
<span class="s0">very much about the new building. He has been reading a little, but</span>
<span class="s0">now&quot;--Michael Ivanovich went on, lowering his voice--&quot;now he's at</span>
<span class="s0">his desk, busy with his will, I expect.&quot; (One of the prince's favorite</span>
<span class="s0">occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant</span>
<span class="s0">to leave at his death and which he called his &quot;will.&quot;)</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk?&quot; asked Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter, the</span>
<span class="s0">old prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was</span>
<span class="s0">sitting at his open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in</span>
<span class="s0">his outstretched hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading</span>
<span class="s0">his manuscript--his &quot;Remarks&quot; as he termed it--which was to be</span>
<span class="s0">transmitted to the Emperor after his death.</span>

<span class="s0">When Michael Ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince's eyes</span>
<span class="s0">evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had</span>
<span class="s0">been written. He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich's hand, put it</span>
<span class="s0">in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpatych who had</span>
<span class="s0">long been waiting.</span>

<span class="s0">The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and,</span>
<span class="s0">walking up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door, he</span>
<span class="s0">gave his instructions.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;First, notepaper--do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,</span>
<span class="s0">gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing</span>
<span class="s0">wax, as in Michael Ivanovich's list.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to</span>
<span class="s0">be of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather</span>
<span class="s0">case had to be ordered to keep the &quot;will&quot; in.</span>

<span class="s0">The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the</span>
<span class="s0">prince did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes, and dozed off. Alpatych made a slight movement.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I'll send after you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into</span>
<span class="s0">it, fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at</span>
<span class="s0">the table to write to the governor.</span>

<span class="s0">It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished</span>
<span class="s0">to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tikhon and went through</span>
<span class="s0">the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.</span>

<span class="s0">He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed</span>
<span class="s0">unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.</span>
<span class="s0">That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory</span>
<span class="s0">everywhere, but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was</span>
<span class="s0">better than other places: he had never slept there yet.</span>

<span class="s0">With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and</span>
<span class="s0">began putting it up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's not right! That's not right!&quot; cried the prince, and</span>
<span class="s0">himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in</span>
<span class="s0">again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, at last I've finished, now I'll rest,&quot; thought the prince,</span>
<span class="s0">and let Tikhon undress him.</span>

<span class="s0">Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself</span>
<span class="s0">of his coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on</span>
<span class="s0">the bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously</span>
<span class="s0">at his withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring</span>
<span class="s0">the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on</span>
<span class="s0">the bed. &quot;Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you</span>
<span class="s0">would release me!&quot; thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that</span>
<span class="s0">effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had</span>
<span class="s0">he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards</span>
<span class="s0">beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened</span>
<span class="s0">to him almost every night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No peace, damn them!&quot; he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. &quot;Ah</span>
<span class="s0">yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was</span>
<span class="s0">keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.</span>
<span class="s0">No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something.</span>
<span class="s0">Something in my pocket--can't remember...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tikhon, what did we talk about at dinner?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;About Prince Michael...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Be quiet, quiet!&quot; The prince slapped his hand on the table. &quot;Yes, I</span>
<span class="s0">know, Prince Andrew's letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said</span>
<span class="s0">something about Vitebsk. Now I'll read it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He had the letter taken from his pocket and the table--on which</span>
<span class="s0">stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle--moved close to</span>
<span class="s0">the bed, and putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in</span>
<span class="s0">the stillness of the night, reading it by the faint light under the</span>
<span class="s0">green shade, did he grasp its meaning for a moment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The French at Vitebsk, in four days' march they may be at Smolensk;</span>
<span class="s0">perhaps are already there! Tikhon!&quot; Tikhon jumped up. &quot;No, no, I don't</span>
<span class="s0">want anything!&quot; he shouted.</span>

<span class="s0">He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And</span>
<span class="s0">there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,</span>
<span class="s0">vigorous and alert, entering Potemkin's gaily colored tent, and a</span>
<span class="s0">burning sense of jealousy of &quot;the favorite&quot; agitated him now as</span>
<span class="s0">strongly as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that</span>
<span class="s0">first meeting with Potemkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather</span>
<span class="s0">sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile</span>
<span class="s0">and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that</span>
<span class="s0">same face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Zubov</span>
<span class="s0">over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with</span>
<span class="s0">all the present! Quicker, quicker--and that they should leave me in</span>
<span class="s0">peace!&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkonski's estate, lay forty miles east</span>
<span class="s0">from Smolensk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that,</span>
<span class="s0">as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure</span>
<span class="s0">his safety, though from Prince Andrew's letter it was evident that</span>
<span class="s0">to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised</span>
<span class="s0">her to send a letter by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor at</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the</span>
<span class="s0">extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles</span>
<span class="s0">wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed it,</span>
<span class="s0">and it was given to Alpatych with instructions to hand it to the</span>
<span class="s0">Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.</span>

<span class="s0">Having received all his orders Alpatych, wearing a white beaver hat-</span>
<span class="s0">a present from the prince--and carrying a stick as the prince did,</span>
<span class="s0">went out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready</span>
<span class="s0">harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.</span>

<span class="s0">The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness</span>
<span class="s0">stuffed with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive</span>
<span class="s0">with ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpatych liked to have them.</span>
<span class="s0">His satellites--the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery</span>
<span class="s0">maid, a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and</span>
<span class="s0">various domestic serfs--were seeing him off.</span>

<span class="s0">His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on</span>
<span class="s0">and behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle,</span>
<span class="s0">and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There! There! Women's fuss! Women, women!&quot; said Alpatych, puffing</span>
<span class="s0">and speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the</span>
<span class="s0">trap.</span>

<span class="s0">After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpatych,</span>
<span class="s0">not trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald</span>
<span class="s0">head and crossed himself three times.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If there is anything... come back, Yakov Alpatych! For Christ's</span>
<span class="s0">sake think of us!&quot; cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war</span>
<span class="s0">and the enemy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Women, women! Women's fuss!&quot; muttered Alpatych to himself and</span>
<span class="s0">started on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye</span>
<span class="s0">and the still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black</span>
<span class="s0">fields just being plowed a second time.</span>

<span class="s0">As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year's splendid crop</span>
<span class="s0">of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there</span>
<span class="s0">were already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing</span>
<span class="s0">and the harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of</span>
<span class="s0">the prince's orders.</span>

<span class="s0">Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town</span>
<span class="s0">toward evening on the fourth of August.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on</span>
<span class="s0">the road. As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of distant</span>
<span class="s0">firing, but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the</span>
<span class="s0">sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and</span>
<span class="s0">which was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder.</span>
<span class="s0">This fact impressed Alpatych, but in thinking about his own business</span>
<span class="s0">he soon forgot it.</span>

<span class="s0">All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been</span>
<span class="s0">bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that</span>
<span class="s0">limit. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince's</span>
<span class="s0">orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">On reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August he put</span>
<span class="s0">up in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by</span>
<span class="s0">Ferapontov, where he had been in the habit of putting up for the</span>
<span class="s0">last thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferapontov, by Alpatych's</span>
<span class="s0">advice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now</span>
<span class="s0">had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer's shop in that province. He was</span>
<span class="s0">a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a</span>
<span class="s0">broad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and</span>
<span class="s0">a round belly.</span>

<span class="s0">Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapontov was standing</span>
<span class="s0">before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpatych he</span>
<span class="s0">went up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're welcome, Yakov Alpatych. Folks are leaving the town, but you</span>
<span class="s0">have come to it,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why are they leaving the town?&quot; asked Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Women's fuss, women's fuss!&quot; said Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych. What I say is: orders have</span>
<span class="s0">been given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants</span>
<span class="s0">are asking three rubles for carting--it isn't Christian!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Yakov Alpatych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for</span>
<span class="s0">hay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.</span>

<span class="s0">All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on</span>
<span class="s0">business. It was a sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already</span>
<span class="s0">hot. &quot;A good day for harvesting,&quot; thought Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At</span>
<span class="s0">eight o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of</span>
<span class="s0">musketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were</span>
<span class="s0">many soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at</span>
<span class="s0">their shops, and service was being held in the churches as usual.</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych went to the shops, to government offices, to the post office,</span>
<span class="s0">and to the Governor's. In the offices and shops and at the post office</span>
<span class="s0">everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was</span>
<span class="s0">already attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be</span>
<span class="s0">done, and all were trying to calm one another.</span>

<span class="s0">In front of the Governor's house Alpatych found a large number of</span>
<span class="s0">people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor's. At the</span>
<span class="s0">porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This</span>
<span class="s0">man, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's no joke, you know! It's all very well if you're single. 'One</span>
<span class="s0">man though undone is but one,' as the proverb says, but with</span>
<span class="s0">thirteen in your family and all the property... They've brought us</span>
<span class="s0">to utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do that? They</span>
<span class="s0">ought to be hanged--the brigands!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh come, that's enough!&quot; said the other.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What do I care? Let him hear! We're not dogs,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">ex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Yakov Alpatych! What have you come for?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To see the Governor by his excellency's order,&quot; answered</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych, lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the</span>
<span class="s0">bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince....</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;He has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs,&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, go and find out!&quot; shouted the angry gentleman. &quot;They've</span>
<span class="s0">brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or</span>
<span class="s0">anything!... There it is again, do you hear?&quot; said he, pointing</span>
<span class="s0">in the direction whence came the sounds of firing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They've brought us all to ruin... the brigands!&quot; he repeated, and</span>
<span class="s0">descended the porch steps.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were</span>
<span class="s0">tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another.</span>
<span class="s0">The door of the Governor's room opened and they all rose and moved</span>
<span class="s0">forward. An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called</span>
<span class="s0">a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and</span>
<span class="s0">vanished again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and</span>
<span class="s0">questions addressed to him. Alpatych moved forward and next time the</span>
<span class="s0">official came out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of</span>
<span class="s0">his buttoned coat, and handed him two letters.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkonski,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official</span>
<span class="s0">turned to him and took the letters.</span>

<span class="s0">A few minutes later the Governor received Alpatych and hurriedly</span>
<span class="s0">said to him:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on</span>
<span class="s0">the highest instructions--here...&quot; and he handed a paper to</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych. &quot;Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they</span>
<span class="s0">should go to Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into</span>
<span class="s0">the room and began to say something in French. The Governor's face</span>
<span class="s0">expressed terror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go,&quot; he said, nodding his head to Alpatych, and began questioning</span>
<span class="s0">the officer.</span>

<span class="s0">Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpatych when</span>
<span class="s0">he came out of the Governor's room. Involuntarily listening now to the</span>
<span class="s0">firing, which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength,</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych hurried to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor</span>
<span class="s0">said this:</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the slightest</span>
<span class="s0">danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with</span>
<span class="s0">any. I from the one side and Prince Bagration from the other are</span>
<span class="s0">marching to unite our forces before Smolensk, which junction will be</span>
<span class="s0">effected on the 22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces</span>
<span class="s0">will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care</span>
<span class="s0">till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland,</span>
<span class="s0">or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From</span>
<span class="s0">this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants of Smolensk, for those defended by two such brave armies</span>
<span class="s0">may feel assured of victory.&quot; (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to</span>
<span class="s0">Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smolensk, 1812.)</span>


<span class="s0">People were anxiously roaming about the streets.</span>

<span class="s0">Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept</span>
<span class="s0">emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.</span>
<span class="s0">Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapontov's and women were</span>
<span class="s0">wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round</span>
<span class="s0">barking in front of the harnessed horses.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went</span>
<span class="s0">straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman</span>
<span class="s0">was asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the</span>
<span class="s0">passage. From the host's room came the sounds of a child crying, the</span>
<span class="s0">despairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of</span>
<span class="s0">Ferapontov. The cook began running hither and thither in the passage</span>
<span class="s0">like a frightened hen, just as Alpatych entered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged</span>
<span class="s0">her about so!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What for?&quot; asked Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She kept begging to go away. She's a woman! 'Take me away,' says</span>
<span class="s0">she, 'don't let me perish with my little children! Folks,' she says,</span>
<span class="s0">'are all gone, so why,' she says, 'don't we go?' And he began</span>
<span class="s0">beating and pulling her about so!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At these words Alpatych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to</span>
<span class="s0">hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper's, where</span>
<span class="s0">he had left his purchases.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You brute, you murderer!&quot; screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a</span>
<span class="s0">baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through</span>
<span class="s0">the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard.</span>

<span class="s0">Ferapontov came out after her, but on seeing Alpatych adjusted his</span>
<span class="s0">waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpatych into the</span>
<span class="s0">opposite room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Going already?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his</span>
<span class="s0">packages and asked how much he owed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We'll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor's?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Ferapontov. &quot;What has been decided?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych replied that the Governor had not told him anything</span>
<span class="s0">definite.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;With our business, how can we get away?&quot; said Ferapontov. &quot;We'd</span>
<span class="s0">have to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and I tell them</span>
<span class="s0">they're not Christians to ask it! Selivanov, now, did a good stroke</span>
<span class="s0">last Thursday--sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will</span>
<span class="s0">you have some tea?&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">While the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov over</span>
<span class="s0">their tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather</span>
<span class="s0">for harvesting.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, it seems to be getting quieter,&quot; remarked Ferapontov,</span>
<span class="s0">finishing his third cup of tea and getting up. &quot;Ours must have got the</span>
<span class="s0">best of it. The orders were not to let them in. So we're in force,</span>
<span class="s0">it seems.... They say the other day Matthew Ivanych Platov drove</span>
<span class="s0">them into the river Marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one</span>
<span class="s0">day.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who</span>
<span class="s0">had come in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels,</span>
<span class="s0">hoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed</span>
<span class="s0">out.</span>

<span class="s0">It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in</span>
<span class="s0">shadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpatych looked out of</span>
<span class="s0">the window and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a</span>
<span class="s0">far-off whistling and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon</span>
<span class="s0">blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling.</span>

<span class="s0">He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the</span>
<span class="s0">bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of</span>
<span class="s0">cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds</span>
<span class="s0">were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside</span>
<span class="s0">the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town</span>
<span class="s0">was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had</span>
<span class="s0">ordered up after four o'clock. The people did not at once realize</span>
<span class="s0">the meaning of this bombardment.</span>

<span class="s0">At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused</span>
<span class="s0">curiosity. Ferapontov's wife, who till then had not ceased wailing</span>
<span class="s0">under the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the</span>
<span class="s0">gate, listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.</span>

<span class="s0">The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively</span>
<span class="s0">curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they</span>
<span class="s0">flew over their heads. Several people came round the corner talking</span>
<span class="s0">eagerly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What force!&quot; remarked one. &quot;Knocked the roof and ceiling all to</span>
<span class="s0">splinters!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Routed up the earth like a pig,&quot; said another.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's grand, it bucks one up!&quot; laughed the first. &quot;Lucky you</span>
<span class="s0">jumped aside, or it would have wiped you out!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had</span>
<span class="s0">fallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now</span>
<span class="s0">with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the</span>
<span class="s0">agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people's heads</span>
<span class="s0">incessantly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpatych</span>
<span class="s0">was getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; he shouted to the cook, who in her red</span>
<span class="s0">skirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped</span>
<span class="s0">to the corner to listen to what was being said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What marvels!&quot; she exclaimed, but hearing her master's voice she</span>
<span class="s0">turned back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.</span>

<span class="s0">Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping</span>
<span class="s0">downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the</span>
<span class="s0">street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Scoundrel, what are you doing?&quot; shouted the innkeeper, rushing to</span>
<span class="s0">the cook.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different</span>
<span class="s0">sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently</span>
<span class="s0">with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was</span>
<span class="s0">her wailing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don't let me die! My good</span>
<span class="s0">souls!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her</span>
<span class="s0">thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych, his coachman, Ferapontov's wife and children and the house</span>
<span class="s0">porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns,</span>
<span class="s0">the whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook,</span>
<span class="s0">which rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The</span>
<span class="s0">mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the</span>
<span class="s0">cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband</span>
<span class="s0">who had remained in the street. A shopman who entered told her that</span>
<span class="s0">her husband had gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were</span>
<span class="s0">fetching the wonder-working icon of Smolensk.</span>

<span class="s0">Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpatych left the cellar</span>
<span class="s0">and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was</span>
<span class="s0">clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon</span>
<span class="s0">shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a</span>
<span class="s0">hush seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of</span>
<span class="s0">footsteps, the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires</span>
<span class="s0">which seemed widespread everywhere. The cook's moans had now subsided.</span>
<span class="s0">On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the</span>
<span class="s0">fires. Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or</span>
<span class="s0">ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined</span>
<span class="s0">ant-hill. Several of them ran into Ferapontov's yard before Alpatych's</span>
<span class="s0">eyes. Alpatych went out to the gate. A retreating regiment,</span>
<span class="s0">thronging and hurrying, blocked the street.</span>

<span class="s0">Noticing him, an officer said: &quot;The town is being abandoned. Get</span>
<span class="s0">away, get away!&quot; and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll teach you to run into the yards!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him</span>
<span class="s0">to set off. Ferapontov's whole household came out too, following</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then,</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires--the smoke and even</span>
<span class="s0">the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight--and as if</span>
<span class="s0">in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of</span>
<span class="s0">the street. Inside the shed Alpatych and the coachman arranged the</span>
<span class="s0">tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands.</span>

<span class="s0">As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">in Ferapontov's open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and</span>
<span class="s0">knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapontov</span>
<span class="s0">returned and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about</span>
<span class="s0">to shout at them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair,</span>
<span class="s0">burst into sobs and laughter:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Loot everything, lads! Don't let those devils get it!&quot; he cried,</span>
<span class="s0">taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.</span>

<span class="s0">Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on</span>
<span class="s0">filling their bags. On seeing Alpatych, Ferapontov turned to him:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Russia is done for!&quot; he cried. &quot;Alpatych, I'll set the place on</span>
<span class="s0">fire myself. We're done for!...&quot; and Ferapontov ran into the yard.</span>

<span class="s0">Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking</span>
<span class="s0">it completely, so that Alpatych could not pass out and had to wait.</span>
<span class="s0">Ferapontov's wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting</span>
<span class="s0">till it was possible to drive out.</span>

<span class="s0">Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone</span>
<span class="s0">out amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the</span>
<span class="s0">Dnieper Alpatych's cart and that of the innkeeper's wife, which were</span>
<span class="s0">slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had</span>
<span class="s0">to stop. In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had</span>
<span class="s0">stopped, a house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already</span>
<span class="s0">burning itself out. The flames now died down and were lost in the</span>
<span class="s0">black smoke, now suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with</span>
<span class="s0">strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the</span>
<span class="s0">crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and through</span>
<span class="s0">the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be</span>
<span class="s0">heard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some</span>
<span class="s0">time, Alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the</span>
<span class="s0">fire. Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near</span>
<span class="s0">it, and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning</span>
<span class="s0">beams into another yard across the street, while others carried</span>
<span class="s0">bundles of hay.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn</span>
<span class="s0">which was blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back</span>
<span class="s0">wall had fallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters</span>
<span class="s0">were alight. The crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in,</span>
<span class="s0">and Alpatych watched for it too.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Alpatych!&quot; a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mercy on us! Your excellency!&quot; answered Alpatych, immediately</span>
<span class="s0">recognizing the voice of his young prince.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was</span>
<span class="s0">looking at Alpatych from the back of the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your... your excellency,&quot; stammered Alpatych and broke into sobs.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Are we really lost? Master!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Prince Andrew repeated.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master's</span>
<span class="s0">pale worn face. Alpatych told how he had been sent there and how</span>
<span class="s0">difficult it was to get away.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are we really quite lost, your excellency?&quot; he asked again.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his</span>
<span class="s0">knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his</span>
<span class="s0">sister:</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at</span>
<span class="s0">once when you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyazh.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Having written this and given the paper to Alpatych, he told him how</span>
<span class="s0">to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the</span>
<span class="s0">boy's tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before</span>
<span class="s0">he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of</span>
<span class="s0">staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are a colonel?&quot; shouted the chief of staff with a German</span>
<span class="s0">accent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. &quot;Houses are set on</span>
<span class="s0">fire in your presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You</span>
<span class="s0">will answer for it!&quot; shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the</span>
<span class="s0">chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of</span>
<span class="s0">the first army, a place, as Berg said, &quot;very agreeable and well en</span>
<span class="s0">evidence.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by</span>
<span class="s0">the tenth I don't receive news that they have all got away I shall</span>
<span class="s0">have to throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Prince,&quot; said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, &quot;I only spoke</span>
<span class="s0">because I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly....</span>
<span class="s0">You must please excuse me,&quot; he went on apologetically.</span>

<span class="s0">Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and</span>
<span class="s0">wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another</span>
<span class="s0">terrible crash and something huge collapsed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ou-rou-rou!&quot; yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the</span>
<span class="s0">collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a</span>
<span class="s0">cakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up again, lighting the</span>
<span class="s0">animated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators.</span>

<span class="s0">The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's fine, lads! Now it's raging... It's fine!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's the owner himself,&quot; cried several voices.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well then,&quot; continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, &quot;report to them as</span>
<span class="s0">I have told you&quot;; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute</span>
<span class="s0">beside him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was</span>
<span class="s0">marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills.</span>
<span class="s0">Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day</span>
<span class="s0">fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the</span>
<span class="s0">sun, but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in</span>
<span class="s0">reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The</span>
<span class="s0">unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up.</span>
<span class="s0">The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched</span>
<span class="s0">meadows. Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was</span>
<span class="s0">there any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along which the</span>
<span class="s0">troops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or when</span>
<span class="s0">the road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the</span>
<span class="s0">sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep. As soon as day dawned</span>
<span class="s0">the march began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly</span>
<span class="s0">through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and</span>
<span class="s0">the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that</span>
<span class="s0">never cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the</span>
<span class="s0">feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the</span>
<span class="s0">troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all</span>
<span class="s0">in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road.</span>
<span class="s0">The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and</span>
<span class="s0">through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked</span>
<span class="s0">eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded</span>
<span class="s0">sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless</span>
<span class="s0">atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses</span>
<span class="s0">and mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to</span>
<span class="s0">the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of</span>
<span class="s0">that regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving</span>
<span class="s0">and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolensk and its</span>
<span class="s0">abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger</span>
<span class="s0">against the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely</span>
<span class="s0">devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to</span>
<span class="s0">his men and officers. In the regiment they called him &quot;our prince,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">were proud of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to</span>
<span class="s0">those of his regiment, to Timokhin and the like--people quite new to</span>
<span class="s0">him, belonging to a different world and who could not know and</span>
<span class="s0">understand his past. As soon as he came across a former acquaintance</span>
<span class="s0">or anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately and grew</span>
<span class="s0">spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded him</span>
<span class="s0">of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that</span>
<span class="s0">former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not</span>
<span class="s0">to be unfair.</span>

<span class="s0">In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the</span>
<span class="s0">sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been</span>
<span class="s0">defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built</span>
<span class="s0">and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">had something to think about entirely apart from general questions.</span>
<span class="s0">Two days previously he had received news that his father, son, and</span>
<span class="s0">sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do</span>
<span class="s0">at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment</span>
<span class="s0">his own grief decided that he must ride there.</span>

<span class="s0">He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on</span>
<span class="s0">the march, rode to his father's estate where he had been born and</span>
<span class="s0">spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to</span>
<span class="s0">be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it</span>
<span class="s0">with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul</span>
<span class="s0">about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and</span>
<span class="s0">half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He</span>
<span class="s0">rode to the keeper's lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of</span>
<span class="s0">the drive and the door stood open. Grass had already begun to grow</span>
<span class="s0">on the garden paths, and horses and calves were straying in the</span>
<span class="s0">English park. Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass</span>
<span class="s0">panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and</span>
<span class="s0">others dried up. He called for Taras the gardener, but no one replied.</span>
<span class="s0">Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden,</span>
<span class="s0">he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the</span>
<span class="s0">plum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was</span>
<span class="s0">sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.</span>

<span class="s0">He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting</span>
<span class="s0">on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him</span>
<span class="s0">strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a</span>
<span class="s0">magnolia.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old</span>
<span class="s0">garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were</span>
<span class="s0">wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes. The shutters</span>
<span class="s0">were all closed, except at one window which was open. A little serf</span>
<span class="s0">boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Alpatych, having sent</span>
<span class="s0">his family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors</span>
<span class="s0">reading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince Andrew had</span>
<span class="s0">come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose, buttoning his coat,</span>
<span class="s0">and, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping and kissing</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's knee.</span>

<span class="s0">Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to</span>
<span class="s0">report on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable</span>
<span class="s0">had been removed to Bogucharovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also</span>
<span class="s0">been carted away. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alpatych</span>
<span class="s0">said there had been a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered</span>
<span class="s0">by the troops and mown down while still green. The peasants were</span>
<span class="s0">ruined; some of them too had gone to Bogucharovo, only a few remained.</span>

<span class="s0">Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When did my father and sister leave?&quot; meaning when did they leave</span>
<span class="s0">for Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again</span>
<span class="s0">went into details concerning the estate management, asking for</span>
<span class="s0">instructions.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for</span>
<span class="s0">them? We have still six hundred quarters left,&quot; he inquired.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What am I to say to him?&quot; thought Prince Andrew, looking down on</span>
<span class="s0">the old man's bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the</span>
<span class="s0">expression on his face that the old man himself understood how</span>
<span class="s0">untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, let them have it,&quot; replied Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If you noticed some disorder in the garden,&quot; said Alpatych, &quot;it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the</span>
<span class="s0">night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their</span>
<span class="s0">commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy</span>
<span class="s0">occupies the place?&quot; asked Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is my refuge! His will be done!&quot; he exclaimed.</span>

<span class="s0">A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow</span>
<span class="s0">toward the prince.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good-by!&quot; said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpatych.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;You must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go</span>
<span class="s0">to the Ryazan estate or to the one near Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych clung to Prince Andrew's leg and burst into sobs. Gently</span>
<span class="s0">disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the</span>
<span class="s0">avenue at a gallop.</span>

<span class="s0">The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly</span>
<span class="s0">impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last</span>
<span class="s0">on which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running</span>
<span class="s0">out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked</span>
<span class="s0">from the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young</span>
<span class="s0">master, the elder one frightened look clutched her younger companion</span>
<span class="s0">by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick</span>
<span class="s0">up some green plums they had dropped.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them</span>
<span class="s0">see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty</span>
<span class="s0">frightened little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt</span>
<span class="s0">an irresistible desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief</span>
<span class="s0">came over him when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of</span>
<span class="s0">other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as</span>
<span class="s0">legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these girls</span>
<span class="s0">passionately desired one thing--to carry away and eat those green</span>
<span class="s0">plums without being caught--and Prince Andrew shared their wish for</span>
<span class="s0">the success of their enterprise. He could not resist looking at them</span>
<span class="s0">once more. Believing their danger past, they sprang from their</span>
<span class="s0">ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill little voices and</span>
<span class="s0">holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned feet scampered</span>
<span class="s0">merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the</span>
<span class="s0">dusty highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from</span>
<span class="s0">Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment</span>
<span class="s0">at its halting place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one</span>
<span class="s0">o'clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his</span>
<span class="s0">back intolerably through his black coat. The dust always hung</span>
<span class="s0">motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops.</span>
<span class="s0">There was no wind. As he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the</span>
<span class="s0">ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to get into that water,</span>
<span class="s0">however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from</span>
<span class="s0">whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, green</span>
<span class="s0">pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because</span>
<span class="s0">it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red</span>
<span class="s0">hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it. All this</span>
<span class="s0">naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in</span>
<span class="s0">that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the</span>
<span class="s0">suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially</span>
<span class="s0">pathetic.</span>

<span class="s0">One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed</span>
<span class="s0">himself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water;</span>
<span class="s0">another, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood</span>
<span class="s0">up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure</span>
<span class="s0">and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head</span>
<span class="s0">with hands blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men</span>
<span class="s0">slapping one another, yelling, and puffing.</span>

<span class="s0">Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was</span>
<span class="s0">healthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timokhin, with his red</span>
<span class="s0">little nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt</span>
<span class="s0">confused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind to address him</span>
<span class="s0">nevertheless.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's very nice, your excellency! Wouldn't you like to?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's dirty,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We'll clear it out for you in a minute,&quot; said Timokhin, and,</span>
<span class="s0">still undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The prince wants to bathe.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What prince? Ours?&quot; said many voices, and the men were in such</span>
<span class="s0">haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He</span>
<span class="s0">decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!&quot; he thought, and he looked at his own</span>
<span class="s0">naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust</span>
<span class="s0">and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that</span>
<span class="s0">immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.</span>


<span class="s0">On the seventh of August Prince Bagration wrote as follows from</span>
<span class="s0">his quarters at Mikhaylovna on the Smolensk road:</span>


<span class="s0">Dear Count Alexis Andreevich--(He was writing to Arakcheev but</span>
<span class="s0">knew that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">weighed every word in it to the best of his ability.)</span>

<span class="s0">I expect the Minister [Barclay de Tolly] has already reported the</span>
<span class="s0">abandonment of Smolensk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and</span>
<span class="s0">the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been</span>
<span class="s0">wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most</span>
<span class="s0">urgently and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to</span>
<span class="s0">consent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as</span>
<span class="s0">never before and might have lost half his army but could not have</span>
<span class="s0">taken Smolensk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, as never</span>
<span class="s0">before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at bay for</span>
<span class="s0">thirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold out even for</span>
<span class="s0">fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for</span>
<span class="s0">him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our</span>
<span class="s0">losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not</span>
<span class="s0">more, and not even that; but even were they ten thousand, that's</span>
<span class="s0">war! But the enemy has lost masses...</span>

<span class="s0">What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They</span>
<span class="s0">would have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water</span>
<span class="s0">for men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. We</span>
<span class="s0">cannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow...</span>

<span class="s0">There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you</span>
<span class="s0">should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats!</span>
<span class="s0">You would set all Russia against you and every one of us would feel</span>
<span class="s0">ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this--we must fight</span>
<span class="s0">as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand...</span>

<span class="s0">One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may</span>
<span class="s0">perhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad</span>
<span class="s0">but execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole</span>
<span class="s0">country.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing</span>
<span class="s0">boldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a</span>
<span class="s0">peace, and that the Minister should command the army, does not love</span>
<span class="s0">our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. So I write you</span>
<span class="s0">frankly: call out the militia. For the Minister is leading these</span>
<span class="s0">visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way. The whole army</span>
<span class="s0">feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is</span>
<span class="s0">said to be more Napoleon's man than ours, and he is always advising</span>
<span class="s0">the Minister. I am not merely civil to him but obey him like a</span>
<span class="s0">corporal, though I am his senior. This is painful, but, loving my</span>
<span class="s0">benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am sorry for the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">that he entrusts our fine army to such as he. Consider that on our</span>
<span class="s0">retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than</span>
<span class="s0">fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would not have</span>
<span class="s0">happened. Tell me, for God's sake, what will Russia, our mother</span>
<span class="s0">Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning</span>
<span class="s0">our good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings</span>
<span class="s0">of hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and</span>
<span class="s0">of whom are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is</span>
<span class="s0">vacillating, a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The</span>
<span class="s0">whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him...</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of</span>
<span class="s0">human life one may discriminate between those in which substance</span>
<span class="s0">prevails and those in which form prevails. To the latter--as</span>
<span class="s0">distinguished from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">life--we may allot Petersburg life, and especially the life of its</span>
<span class="s0">salons. That life of the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805</span>
<span class="s0">we had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had</span>
<span class="s0">made constitutions and unmade them again, but the salons of Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Pavlovna Helene remained just as they had been--the one seven and</span>
<span class="s0">the other five years before. At Anna Pavlovna's they talked with</span>
<span class="s0">perplexity of Bonaparte's successes just as before and saw in them and</span>
<span class="s0">in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a</span>
<span class="s0">malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause</span>
<span class="s0">unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Pavlovna was the representative. And in Helene's salon, which</span>
<span class="s0">Rumyantsev himself honored with his visits, regarding Helene as a</span>
<span class="s0">remarkably intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in</span>
<span class="s0">1812 as in 1808 of the &quot;great nation&quot; and the &quot;great man,&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">regretted our rupture with France, a rupture which, according to them,</span>
<span class="s0">ought to be promptly terminated by peace.</span>

<span class="s0">Of late, since the Emperor's return from the army, there had been</span>
<span class="s0">some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some</span>
<span class="s0">demonstrations of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its</span>
<span class="s0">own tendency. In Anna Pavlovna's circle only those Frenchmen were</span>
<span class="s0">admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were</span>
<span class="s0">expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the French theater</span>
<span class="s0">and that to maintain the French troupe was costing the government as</span>
<span class="s0">much as a whole army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly</span>
<span class="s0">followed, and only the reports most flattering to our army were</span>
<span class="s0">circulated. In the French circle of Helene and Rumyantsev the</span>
<span class="s0">reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted</span>
<span class="s0">and all Napoleon's attempts at conciliation were discussed. In that</span>
<span class="s0">circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for</span>
<span class="s0">a removal to Kazan of the court and the girls' educational</span>
<span class="s0">establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress. In Helene's</span>
<span class="s0">circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal</span>
<span class="s0">demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the view</span>
<span class="s0">prevailed expressed by Bilibin--who now in Petersburg was quite at</span>
<span class="s0">home in Helene's house, which every clever man was obliged to visit-</span>
<span class="s0">that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be</span>
<span class="s0">settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm--news of which had</span>
<span class="s0">reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor's return--was</span>
<span class="s0">ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.</span>

<span class="s0">Anna Pavlovna's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the</span>
<span class="s0">ancients. Prince Vasili, who still occupied his former important</span>
<span class="s0">posts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He</span>
<span class="s0">visited his &quot;good friend Anna Pavlovna&quot; as well as his daughter's</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;diplomatic salon,&quot; and often in his constant comings and goings</span>
<span class="s0">between the two camps became confused and said at Helene's what he</span>
<span class="s0">should have said at Anna Pavlovna's and vice versa.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after the Emperor's return Prince Vasili in a conversation</span>
<span class="s0">about the war at Anna Pavlovna's severely condemned Barclay de</span>
<span class="s0">Tolly, but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander</span>
<span class="s0">in chief. One of the visitors, usually spoken of as &quot;a man of great</span>
<span class="s0">merit,&quot; having described how he had that day seen Kutuzov, the newly</span>
<span class="s0">chosen chief of the Petersburg militia, presiding over the</span>
<span class="s0">enrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest</span>
<span class="s0">that Kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements.</span>

<span class="s0">Anna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutuzov had done</span>
<span class="s0">nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,&quot; Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Vasili interrupted, &quot;but they did not listen to me. I told them his</span>
<span class="s0">election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They</span>
<span class="s0">did not listen to me.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's all this mania for opposition,&quot; he went on. &quot;And who for? It</span>
<span class="s0">is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those</span>
<span class="s0">Muscovites,&quot; Prince Vasili continued, forgetting for a moment that</span>
<span class="s0">though at Helene's one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at</span>
<span class="s0">Anna Pavlovna's one had to be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved</span>
<span class="s0">his mistake at once. &quot;Now, is it suitable that Count Kutuzov, the</span>
<span class="s0">oldest general in Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He will get</span>
<span class="s0">nothing for his pains! How could they make a man commander in chief</span>
<span class="s0">who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the</span>
<span class="s0">very worst morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest!</span>
<span class="s0">I don't speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this</span>
<span class="s0">how they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively</span>
<span class="s0">blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can't see anything.</span>
<span class="s0">To play blindman's bluff? He can't see at all!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">No one replied to his remarks.</span>

<span class="s0">This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-ninth of July Kutuzov received the title of Prince. This</span>
<span class="s0">might indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasili's</span>
<span class="s0">opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry</span>
<span class="s0">to express it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting</span>
<span class="s0">of Field Marshal Saltykov, Arakcheev, Vyazmitinov, Lopukhin, and</span>
<span class="s0">Kochubey met to consider the progress of the war. This committee</span>
<span class="s0">came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity</span>
<span class="s0">in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor's dislike of Kutuzov, after a short deliberation they</span>
<span class="s0">agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief. That same</span>
<span class="s0">day Kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the</span>
<span class="s0">armies and over the whole region occupied by them.</span>

<span class="s0">On the ninth of August Prince Vasili at Anna Pavlovna's again met</span>
<span class="s0">the &quot;man of great merit.&quot; The latter was very attentive to Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the</span>
<span class="s0">educational establishments for young ladies. Prince Vasili entered the</span>
<span class="s0">room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object</span>
<span class="s0">of his desires.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutuzov is field</span>
<span class="s0">marshal! All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At</span>
<span class="s0">last we have a man!&quot; said he, glancing sternly and significantly round</span>
<span class="s0">at everyone in the drawing room.</span>

<span class="s0">The &quot;man of great merit,&quot; despite his desire to obtain the post of</span>
<span class="s0">director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasili of his former</span>
<span class="s0">opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasili in Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Pavlovna's drawing room, and also to Anna Pavlovna herself who had</span>
<span class="s0">received the news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But, Prince, they say he is blind!&quot; said he, reminding Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Vasili of his own words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,&quot; said Prince Vasili rapidly,</span>
<span class="s0">in a deep voice and with a slight cough--the voice and cough with</span>
<span class="s0">which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He sees well enough,&quot; he added. &quot;And what I am so pleased about,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he went on, &quot;is that our sovereign has given him full powers over</span>
<span class="s0">all the armies and the whole region--powers no commander in chief ever</span>
<span class="s0">had before. He is a second autocrat,&quot; he concluded with a victorious</span>
<span class="s0">smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;God grant it! God grant it!&quot; said Anna Pavlovna.</span>

<span class="s0">The &quot;man of great merit,&quot; who was still a novice in court circles,</span>
<span class="s0">wishing to flatter Anna Pavlovna by defending her former position on</span>
<span class="s0">this question, observed:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutuzov those</span>
<span class="s0">powers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read,</span>
<span class="s0">when he said to Kutuzov: 'Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you</span>
<span class="s0">this honor.'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, no, no!&quot; warmly rejoined Prince Vasili, who would not now yield</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutuzov was not only admirable</span>
<span class="s0">himself, but was adored by everybody. &quot;No, that's impossible,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">he, &quot;for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;God grant only that Prince Kutuzov assumes real power and does</span>
<span class="s0">not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,&quot; observed Anna Pavlovna.</span>

<span class="s0">Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasili said in a</span>
<span class="s0">whisper:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition that</span>
<span class="s0">the Tsarevich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Prince Vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov to the Emperor. &quot;I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor</span>
<span class="s0">reward him if he does right.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutuzov! I have known him a long</span>
<span class="s0">time!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They even say,&quot; remarked the &quot;man of great merit&quot; who did not yet</span>
<span class="s0">possess courtly tact, &quot;that his excellency made it an express</span>
<span class="s0">condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as he said this both Prince Vasili and Anna Pavlovna</span>
<span class="s0">turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at</span>
<span class="s0">his naivete.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already</span>
<span class="s0">passed Smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to</span>
<span class="s0">justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against</span>
<span class="s0">his will. He is as right as other historians who look for the</span>
<span class="s0">explanation of historic events in the will of one man; he is as</span>
<span class="s0">right as the Russian historians who maintain that Napoleon was drawn</span>
<span class="s0">to Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders. Here besides the law</span>
<span class="s0">of retrospection, which regards all the past as a preparation for</span>
<span class="s0">events that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity comes in,</span>
<span class="s0">confusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer having lost a game is</span>
<span class="s0">sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made</span>
<span class="s0">and looks for that mistake in the opening, but forgets that at each</span>
<span class="s0">stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his</span>
<span class="s0">moves were perfect. He only notices the mistake to which he pays</span>
<span class="s0">attention, because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more</span>
<span class="s0">complex than this is the game of war, which occurs under certain</span>
<span class="s0">limits of time, and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless</span>
<span class="s0">objects, but everything results from innumerable conflicts of</span>
<span class="s0">various wills!</span>

<span class="s0">After Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobuzh at Vyazma,</span>
<span class="s0">and then at Tsarevo-Zaymishche, but it happened that owing to a</span>
<span class="s0">conjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give</span>
<span class="s0">battle till they reached Borodino, seventy miles from Moscow. From</span>
<span class="s0">Vyazma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacree</span>
<span class="s0">des peuples d'Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme</span>
<span class="s0">de pagodes chinoises,* this Moscow gave Napoleon's imagination no</span>
<span class="s0">rest. On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light</span>
<span class="s0">bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his</span>
<span class="s0">pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind</span>
<span class="s0">to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by</span>
<span class="s0">Lelorgne d'Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a</span>
<span class="s0">gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the sacred</span>
<span class="s0">city of Alexander's people, Moscow with its innumerable churches</span>
<span class="s0">shaped like Chinese pagodas.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Well?&quot; asked Napoleon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One of Platov's Cossacks says that Platov's corps is joining up</span>
<span class="s0">with the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander in</span>
<span class="s0">chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and</span>
<span class="s0">bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several</span>
<span class="s0">adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavrushka, the serf Denisov</span>
<span class="s0">had handed over to Rostov, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly's</span>
<span class="s0">jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are a Cossack?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental</span>
<span class="s0">mind the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the</span>
<span class="s0">incidents of the war,&quot; says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality</span>
<span class="s0">Lavrushka, having got drunk the day before and left his master</span>
<span class="s0">dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of</span>
<span class="s0">chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him</span>
<span class="s0">prisoner. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who</span>
<span class="s0">have seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do</span>
<span class="s0">everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort</span>
<span class="s0">of service to their master, and are keen at guessing their master's</span>
<span class="s0">baser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness.</span>

<span class="s0">Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had</span>
<span class="s0">easily and surely recognized, Lavrushka was not in the least abashed</span>
<span class="s0">but merely did his utmost to gain his new master's favor.</span>

<span class="s0">He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon's presence</span>
<span class="s0">could no more intimidate him than Rostov's, or a sergeant major's with</span>
<span class="s0">the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant</span>
<span class="s0">major or Napoleon could deprive him of.</span>

<span class="s0">So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the</span>
<span class="s0">orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the</span>
<span class="s0">Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrushka screwed</span>
<span class="s0">up his eyes and considered.</span>

<span class="s0">In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see</span>
<span class="s0">cunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's like this,&quot; he said thoughtfully, &quot;if there's a battle soon,</span>
<span class="s0">yours will win. That's right. But if three days pass, then after that,</span>
<span class="s0">well, then that same battle will not soon be over.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">thus: &quot;If a battle takes place within the next three days the French</span>
<span class="s0">will win, but if later, God knows what will happen.&quot; Napoleon did</span>
<span class="s0">not smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, and he</span>
<span class="s0">ordered these words to be repeated.</span>

<span class="s0">Lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending</span>
<span class="s0">not to know who Napoleon was, added:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in</span>
<span class="s0">the world, but we are a different matter...&quot;--without knowing why or</span>
<span class="s0">how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.</span>

<span class="s0">The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase,</span>
<span class="s0">and Bonaparte smiled. &quot;The young Cossack made his mighty</span>
<span class="s0">interlocutor smile,&quot; says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news</span>
<span class="s0">that he was talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who</span>
<span class="s0">had written his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would</span>
<span class="s0">affect this enfant du Don.*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Child of the Don.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka.</span>

<span class="s0">Lavrushka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and</span>
<span class="s0">that Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new</span>
<span class="s0">masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken</span>
<span class="s0">to be whipped. &quot;As soon as Napoleon's interpreter had spoken,&quot; says</span>
<span class="s0">Thiers, &quot;the Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word,</span>
<span class="s0">but rode on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached</span>
<span class="s0">him across the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon, after making the Cossack a present, had him set free like</span>
<span class="s0">a bird restored to its native fields.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his</span>
<span class="s0">imagination, and &quot;the bird restored to its native fields&quot; galloped</span>
<span class="s0">to our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but</span>
<span class="s0">that he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place</span>
<span class="s0">he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth</span>
<span class="s0">telling. He found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating</span>
<span class="s0">with Platov's detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov, quartered at Yankovo. Rostov was just mounting to go for a</span>
<span class="s0">ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyin; he let Lavrushka</span>
<span class="s0">have another horse and took him along with him.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">supposed.</span>

<span class="s0">After the return of Alpatych from Smolensk the old prince suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be</span>
<span class="s0">called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at</span>
<span class="s0">Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief's discretion to take measures or not for the</span>
<span class="s0">defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia's oldest generals would</span>
<span class="s0">be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would</span>
<span class="s0">remain at Bald Hills.</span>

<span class="s0">But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the</span>
<span class="s0">departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her</span>
<span class="s0">father's feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy,</span>
<span class="s0">could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in</span>
<span class="s0">her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her</span>
<span class="s0">father's fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every</span>
<span class="s0">injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told</span>
<span class="s0">her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had</span>
<span class="s0">harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life</span>
<span class="s0">to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her</span>
<span class="s0">that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared</span>
<span class="s0">that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to</span>
<span class="s0">dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as she had</span>
<span class="s0">feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to</span>
<span class="s0">let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in</span>
<span class="s0">the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had</span>
<span class="s0">not gone away.</span>

<span class="s0">The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned</span>
<span class="s0">his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His</span>
<span class="s0">caleche was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the</span>
<span class="s0">house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden</span>
<span class="s0">to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window</span>
<span class="s0">listening to his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path,</span>
<span class="s0">and into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were</span>
<span class="s0">moving toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by</span>
<span class="s0">the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and</span>
<span class="s0">decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that</span>
<span class="s0">fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,</span>
<span class="s0">could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see</span>
<span class="s0">was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one</span>
<span class="s0">of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his</span>
<span class="s0">helpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out</span>
<span class="s0">what he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on</span>
<span class="s0">the very couch he had so feared of late.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said</span>
<span class="s0">that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.</span>

<span class="s0">It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and</span>
<span class="s0">next day they moved the prince to Bogucharovo, the doctor accompanying</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">By the time they reached Bogucharovo, Dessalles and the little</span>
<span class="s0">prince had already left for Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the</span>
<span class="s0">new house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo, ever in the same</span>
<span class="s0">state, getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay</span>
<span class="s0">like a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and</span>
<span class="s0">lips twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood</span>
<span class="s0">what was going on around him or not. One thing was certain--that he</span>
<span class="s0">was suffering and wished to say something. But what it was, no one</span>
<span class="s0">could tell: it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man,</span>
<span class="s0">or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was</span>
<span class="s0">due to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell</span>
<span class="s0">her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his</span>
<span class="s0">restlessness confirmed her opinion.</span>

<span class="s0">He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was</span>
<span class="s0">no hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not</span>
<span class="s0">do to let him die on the road. &quot;Would it not be better if the end</span>
<span class="s0">did come, the very end?&quot; Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and</span>
<span class="s0">day, hardly sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say,</span>
<span class="s0">often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but</span>
<span class="s0">wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end.</span>

<span class="s0">Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet</span>
<span class="s0">there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that</span>
<span class="s0">since her father's illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed</span>
<span class="s0">with him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires</span>
<span class="s0">and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened.</span>
<span class="s0">Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years--thoughts of a life</span>
<span class="s0">free from the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and</span>
<span class="s0">of family happiness--floated continually in her imagination like</span>
<span class="s0">temptations of the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions</span>
<span class="s0">continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now,</span>
<span class="s0">after that. These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew</span>
<span class="s0">it. She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she</span>
<span class="s0">tried to pray. She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons,</span>
<span class="s0">repeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt</span>
<span class="s0">that a different world had now taken possession of her--the life of</span>
<span class="s0">a world of strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual</span>
<span class="s0">world in which till now she had been confined and in which her</span>
<span class="s0">greatest comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not</span>
<span class="s0">weep, and worldly cares took possession of her.</span>

<span class="s0">It was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo. News of the</span>
<span class="s0">approach of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten</span>
<span class="s0">miles from Bogucharovo, a homestead had been looted by French</span>
<span class="s0">marauders.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the</span>
<span class="s0">provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of</span>
<span class="s0">the rural police having come to Bogucharovo urged the same thing,</span>
<span class="s0">saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that</span>
<span class="s0">French proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the</span>
<span class="s0">princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could</span>
<span class="s0">not answer for the consequences.</span>

<span class="s0">The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of</span>
<span class="s0">preparation and giving orders, for which everyone came to her,</span>
<span class="s0">occupied her all day. She spent the night of the fourteenth as</span>
<span class="s0">usual, without undressing, in the room next to the one where the</span>
<span class="s0">prince lay. Several times, waking up, she heard his groans and</span>
<span class="s0">muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of Tikhon and the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor when they turned him over. Several times she listened at the</span>
<span class="s0">door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than</span>
<span class="s0">usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not sleep and</span>
<span class="s0">several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter but</span>
<span class="s0">not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw</span>
<span class="s0">and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to</span>
<span class="s0">him. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look</span>
<span class="s0">she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in</span>
<span class="s0">during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.</span>

<span class="s0">But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of</span>
<span class="s0">losing him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and</span>
<span class="s0">act of his found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid</span>
<span class="s0">these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her</span>
<span class="s0">imagination: thoughts of how things would be after his death, and</span>
<span class="s0">how her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove these</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he became quiet and she</span>
<span class="s0">fell asleep.</span>

<span class="s0">She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed</span>
<span class="s0">her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father's illness.</span>
<span class="s0">On waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and,</span>
<span class="s0">hearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were</span>
<span class="s0">still the same.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.</span>

<span class="s0">She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In</span>
<span class="s0">front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being</span>
<span class="s0">packed into the vehicles.</span>

<span class="s0">It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch,</span>
<span class="s0">still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and</span>
<span class="s0">went out to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is a little better today,&quot; said he. &quot;I was looking for you.</span>
<span class="s0">One can make out something of what he is saying. His head is</span>
<span class="s0">clearer. Come in, he is asking for you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary's heart beat so violently at this news that she grew</span>
<span class="s0">pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him,</span>
<span class="s0">talk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was</span>
<span class="s0">overflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment</span>
<span class="s0">of joy and terror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come,&quot; said the doctor.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary entered her father's room and went up to his bed. He</span>
<span class="s0">was lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with</span>
<span class="s0">their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed</span>
<span class="s0">straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips</span>
<span class="s0">motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His</span>
<span class="s0">face seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown</span>
<span class="s0">smaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand</span>
<span class="s0">pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting</span>
<span class="s0">for her to come. He twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered</span>
<span class="s0">angrily.</span>

<span class="s0">She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her.</span>
<span class="s0">When she changed her position so that his left eye could see her</span>
<span class="s0">face he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds.</span>
<span class="s0">Then his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak,</span>
<span class="s0">gazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might</span>
<span class="s0">not understand.</span>

<span class="s0">Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic</span>
<span class="s0">efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with</span>
<span class="s0">difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said</span>
<span class="s0">something, repeating the same words several times. She could not</span>
<span class="s0">understand them, but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly</span>
<span class="s0">repeated the words he uttered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mmm...ar...ate...ate...&quot; he repeated several times.</span>

<span class="s0">It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor</span>
<span class="s0">thought he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: &quot;Mary, are</span>
<span class="s0">you afraid?&quot; The prince shook his head, again repeated the same</span>
<span class="s0">sounds.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My mind, my mind aches?&quot; questioned Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and</span>
<span class="s0">began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to</span>
<span class="s0">find the right place for it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...&quot; he then uttered much</span>
<span class="s0">more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being</span>
<span class="s0">understood.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide</span>
<span class="s0">her sobs and tears.</span>

<span class="s0">He moved his hand over her hair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have been calling you all night...&quot; he brought out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If only I had known...&quot; she said through her tears. &quot;I was afraid</span>
<span class="s0">to come in.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He pressed her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Weren't you asleep?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I did not sleep,&quot; said Princess Mary, shaking her head.</span>

<span class="s0">Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself</span>
<span class="s0">as he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to move with difficulty.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear one... Dearest...&quot; Princess Mary could not quite make out what</span>
<span class="s0">he had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a</span>
<span class="s0">tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before. &quot;Why</span>
<span class="s0">didn't you come in?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I was wishing for his death!&quot; thought Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">He was silent awhile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!...</span>
<span class="s0">thank you!... forgive!... thank you!...&quot; and tears began to flow</span>
<span class="s0">from his eyes. &quot;Call Andrew!&quot; he said suddenly, and a childish,</span>
<span class="s0">timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.</span>

<span class="s0">He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least</span>
<span class="s0">it seemed to Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have a letter from him,&quot; she replied.</span>

<span class="s0">He glanced at her with timid surprise.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is he?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's with the army, Father, at Smolensk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in</span>
<span class="s0">answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood</span>
<span class="s0">and remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, softly and distinctly. &quot;Russia has perished. They've</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed her.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes.</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she</span>
<span class="s0">gazed at his face.</span>

<span class="s0">Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">and Tikhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.</span>

<span class="s0">Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them</span>
<span class="s0">could understand for a long time, till at last Tikhon understood and</span>
<span class="s0">repeated it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in</span>
<span class="s0">the mood in which he had just been speaking. She thought he was</span>
<span class="s0">speaking of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson,</span>
<span class="s0">or of his own death, and so she could not guess his words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Put on your white dress. I like it,&quot; was what he said.</span>

<span class="s0">Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and</span>
<span class="s0">trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left</span>
<span class="s0">the room the prince again began speaking about his son, about the war,</span>
<span class="s0">and about the Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his</span>
<span class="s0">hoarse voice, and then he had a second and final stroke.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot</span>
<span class="s0">and sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel</span>
<span class="s0">nothing, except passionate love for her father, love such as she</span>
<span class="s0">thought she had never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing</span>
<span class="s0">into the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues of young</span>
<span class="s0">lime trees Prince Andrew had planted.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end</span>
<span class="s0">quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me?</span>
<span class="s0">What use will peace be when he is no longer here?&quot; Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">murmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her</span>
<span class="s0">hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her</span>
<span class="s0">again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne--who had remained</span>
<span class="s0">at Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it--coming toward her with</span>
<span class="s0">a stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district,</span>
<span class="s0">who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for</span>
<span class="s0">her prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding</span>
<span class="s0">him; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with</span>
<span class="s0">him. Then, excusing herself, she went to the door of the old</span>
<span class="s0">prince's room. The doctor came out with an agitated face and said</span>
<span class="s0">she could not enter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot</span>
<span class="s0">of the slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know</span>
<span class="s0">how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a</span>
<span class="s0">woman's footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyasha</span>
<span class="s0">her maid, who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Please come, Princess... The Prince,&quot; said Dunyasha in a breaking</span>
<span class="s0">voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Immediately, I'm coming, I'm coming!&quot; replied the princess</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly, not giving Dunyasha time to finish what she was saying, and</span>
<span class="s0">trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Princess, it's God's will! You must be prepared for everything,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let me alone; it's not true!&quot; she cried angrily to him.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her</span>
<span class="s0">father's door. &quot;Why are these people with frightened faces stopping</span>
<span class="s0">me? I don't want any of them! And what are they doing here?&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">thought. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that</span>
<span class="s0">previously darkened room startled her. In the room were her nurse</span>
<span class="s0">and other women. They all drew back from the bed, making way for</span>
<span class="s0">her. He was still lying on the bed as before, but the stern expression</span>
<span class="s0">of his quiet face made Princess Mary stop short on the threshold.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, he's not dead--it's impossible!&quot; she told herself and</span>
<span class="s0">approached him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed</span>
<span class="s0">her lips to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force</span>
<span class="s0">of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly</span>
<span class="s0">and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before</span>
<span class="s0">her. &quot;No, he is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something</span>
<span class="s0">unfamiliar and hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent</span>
<span class="s0">mystery!&quot; And hiding her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into</span>
<span class="s0">the arms of the doctor, who held her up.</span>


<span class="s0">In the presence of Tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had</span>
<span class="s0">been the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth</span>
<span class="s0">should not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied</span>
<span class="s0">together the legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed</span>
<span class="s0">him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little</span>
<span class="s0">body on a table. Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but</span>
<span class="s0">it all got done as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were</span>
<span class="s0">burning round his coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was</span>
<span class="s0">strewn with sprays of juniper, a printed band was tucked in under</span>
<span class="s0">his shriveled head, and in a corner of the room sat a chanter</span>
<span class="s0">reading the psalms.</span>

<span class="s0">Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the</span>
<span class="s0">inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round</span>
<span class="s0">the coffin--the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women--and all</span>
<span class="s0">with fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and</span>
<span class="s0">kissed the old prince's cold and stiffened hand.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">Until Prince Andrew settled in Bogucharovo its owners had always</span>
<span class="s0">been absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character</span>
<span class="s0">from those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress,</span>
<span class="s0">and disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used</span>
<span class="s0">to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to</span>
<span class="s0">Bald Hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches,</span>
<span class="s0">but he disliked them for their boorishness.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's last stay at Bogucharovo, when he introduced</span>
<span class="s0">hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to</span>
<span class="s0">pay, had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary</span>
<span class="s0">strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called</span>
<span class="s0">boorishness. Various obscure rumors were always current among them: at</span>
<span class="s0">one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at</span>
<span class="s0">another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; then</span>
<span class="s0">of some proclamation of the Tsar's and of an oath to the Tsar Paul</span>
<span class="s0">in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been</span>
<span class="s0">granted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of Peter</span>
<span class="s0">Fedorovich's return to the throne in seven years' time, when</span>
<span class="s0">everything would be made free and so &quot;simple&quot; that there would be no</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were</span>
<span class="s0">connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of</span>
<span class="s0">Antichrist, the end of the world, and &quot;pure freedom.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging to</span>
<span class="s0">the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work</span>
<span class="s0">where they pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the</span>
<span class="s0">neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in</span>
<span class="s0">the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents</span>
<span class="s0">in the life of the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are</span>
<span class="s0">so baffling to contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly</span>
<span class="s0">noticeable than among others. One instance, which had occurred some</span>
<span class="s0">twenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to emigrate</span>
<span class="s0">to some unknown &quot;warm rivers.&quot; Hundreds of peasants, among them the</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in</span>
<span class="s0">whole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere</span>
<span class="s0">beyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to</span>
<span class="s0">the southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off</span>
<span class="s0">in caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or</span>
<span class="s0">walked toward the &quot;warm rivers.&quot; Many of them were punished, some sent</span>
<span class="s0">to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of</span>
<span class="s0">their own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it</span>
<span class="s0">had sprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still</span>
<span class="s0">existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest</span>
<span class="s0">themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time</span>
<span class="s0">simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in</span>
<span class="s0">close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents</span>
<span class="s0">were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych, who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old</span>
<span class="s0">prince's death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where</span>
<span class="s0">over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and</span>
<span class="s0">leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the</span>
<span class="s0">peasants in the steppe region round Bogucharovo were, it was</span>
<span class="s0">rumored, in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that</span>
<span class="s0">passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learned from</span>
<span class="s0">domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great</span>
<span class="s0">influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving</span>
<span class="s0">a government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks</span>
<span class="s0">were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not harm</span>
<span class="s0">them. Alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant</span>
<span class="s0">had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which was occupied</span>
<span class="s0">by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would</span>
<span class="s0">be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid</span>
<span class="s0">for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought</span>
<span class="s0">from Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that</span>
<span class="s0">they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.</span>

<span class="s0">More important still, Alpatych learned that on the morning of the</span>
<span class="s0">very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the</span>
<span class="s0">princess' luggage from Bogucharovo, there had been a village meeting</span>
<span class="s0">at which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no</span>
<span class="s0">time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince's death,</span>
<span class="s0">the Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary's leaving at once, as it was</span>
<span class="s0">becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he</span>
<span class="s0">could not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of</span>
<span class="s0">the day the old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return</span>
<span class="s0">next day for the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he</span>
<span class="s0">received tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had</span>
<span class="s0">barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.</span>

<span class="s0">For some thirty years Bogucharovo had been managed by the village</span>
<span class="s0">Elder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive &quot;Dronushka.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants</span>
<span class="s0">who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged</span>
<span class="s0">till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a</span>
<span class="s0">tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after the migration to the &quot;warm rivers,&quot; in which he had taken</span>
<span class="s0">part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their</span>
<span class="s0">master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the</span>
<span class="s0">steward respected him and jestingly called him &quot;the Minister.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">During the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill,</span>
<span class="s0">never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the</span>
<span class="s0">least fatigue, and though he could not read he had never forgotten a</span>
<span class="s0">single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of</span>
<span class="s0">the endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of</span>
<span class="s0">the whole corn crop on any single acre of the Bogucharovo fields.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for</span>
<span class="s0">his Dron on the day of the prince's funeral and told him to have</span>
<span class="s0">twelve horses got ready for the princess' carriages and eighteen carts</span>
<span class="s0">for the things to be removed from Bogucharovo. Though the peasants</span>
<span class="s0">paid quitrent, Alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about</span>
<span class="s0">complying with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty</span>
<span class="s0">households at work in Bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do.</span>
<span class="s0">But on hearing the order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent.</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych named certain peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take</span>
<span class="s0">the carts.</span>

<span class="s0">Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no</span>
<span class="s0">horses available: some horses were carting for the government,</span>
<span class="s0">others were too weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It</span>
<span class="s0">seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages, much less</span>
<span class="s0">for the carting.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a</span>
<span class="s0">model village Elder, so Alpatych had not managed the prince's</span>
<span class="s0">estates for twenty years in vain. He a model steward, possessing in</span>
<span class="s0">the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts</span>
<span class="s0">of those he dealt with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood</span>
<span class="s0">that his answers did not express his personal views but the general</span>
<span class="s0">mood of the Bogucharovo commune, by which the Elder had already been</span>
<span class="s0">carried away. But he also knew that Dron, who had acquired property</span>
<span class="s0">and was hated by the commune, must be hesitating between the two</span>
<span class="s0">camps: the masters' and the serfs'. He noticed this hesitation in</span>
<span class="s0">Dron's look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now just listen, Dronushka,&quot; said he. &quot;Don't talk nonsense to me.</span>
<span class="s0">His excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the</span>
<span class="s0">people away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order</span>
<span class="s0">from the Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar.</span>
<span class="s0">Do you hear?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I hear,&quot; Dron answered without lifting his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych was not satisfied with this reply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!&quot; he said, shaking his head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The power is in your hands,&quot; Dron rejoined sadly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, Dron, drop it!&quot; Alpatych repeated, withdrawing his hand from</span>
<span class="s0">his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron's feet. &quot;I can</span>
<span class="s0">see through you and three yards into the ground under you,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">continued, gazing at the floor in front of Dron.</span>

<span class="s0">Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpatych and again</span>
<span class="s0">lowered his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave</span>
<span class="s0">their homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow</span>
<span class="s0">morning for the princess' things. And don't go to any meeting</span>
<span class="s0">yourself, do you hear?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dron suddenly fell on his knees.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yakov Alpatych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge</span>
<span class="s0">me, for Christ's sake!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stop that!&quot; cried Alpatych sternly. &quot;I see through you and three</span>
<span class="s0">yards under you,&quot; he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping,</span>
<span class="s0">his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that</span>
<span class="s0">he had been able to retain the old prince's favor for twenty years had</span>
<span class="s0">long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the</span>
<span class="s0">power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute</span>
<span class="s0">of wizards.</span>

<span class="s0">Dron got up and was about to say something, but Alpatych interrupted</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you</span>
<span class="s0">thinking of, eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What am I to do with the people?&quot; said Dron. &quot;They're quite</span>
<span class="s0">beside themselves; I have already told them...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;'Told them,' I dare say!&quot; said Alpatych. &quot;Are they drinking?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">asked abruptly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quite beside themselves, Yakov Alpatych; they've fetched another</span>
<span class="s0">barrel.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, listen! I'll go to the police officer, and you tell</span>
<span class="s0">them so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got</span>
<span class="s0">ready.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I understand.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no</span>
<span class="s0">suspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">understand&quot; from Dron, Alpatych contented himself with that, though he</span>
<span class="s0">not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of</span>
<span class="s0">troops the carts would not be forthcoming.</span>

<span class="s0">And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided.</span>
<span class="s0">In the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being</span>
<span class="s0">held, which decided that the horses should be driven out into the</span>
<span class="s0">woods and the carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of</span>
<span class="s0">this to the princess, Alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the</span>
<span class="s0">carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready</span>
<span class="s0">for the princess' carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police</span>
<span class="s0">authorities.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">After her father's funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room</span>
<span class="s0">and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpatych</span>
<span class="s0">was asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk</span>
<span class="s0">with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she</span>
<span class="s0">had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not</span>
<span class="s0">mean to go away and begged to be left in peace.</span>

<span class="s0">The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward.</span>
<span class="s0">She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons</span>
<span class="s0">of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her</span>
<span class="s0">confused thoughts were centered on one subject--the irrevocability</span>
<span class="s0">of death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not</span>
<span class="s0">suspected, but which had shown itself during her father's illness. She</span>
<span class="s0">wished to pray but did not dare to, dared not in her present state</span>
<span class="s0">of mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time in that</span>
<span class="s0">position.</span>

<span class="s0">The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting</span>
<span class="s0">rays shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of</span>
<span class="s0">the morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of</span>
<span class="s0">her thoughts suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed</span>
<span class="s0">her hair, got up, and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the</span>
<span class="s0">freshness of the clear but windy evening.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will</span>
<span class="s0">hinder you,&quot; she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her</span>
<span class="s0">head fall on the window sill.</span>

<span class="s0">Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden</span>
<span class="s0">and kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a</span>
<span class="s0">black dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary,</span>
<span class="s0">sighed, kissed her, and immediately began to cry. The princess</span>
<span class="s0">looked up at her. All their former disharmony and her own jealousy</span>
<span class="s0">recurred to her mind. But she remembered too how he had changed of</span>
<span class="s0">late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could not bear to see her,</span>
<span class="s0">thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches Princess Mary had</span>
<span class="s0">mentally addressed to her. &quot;Besides, is it for me, for me who</span>
<span class="s0">desired his death, to condemn anyone?&quot; she thought.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but</span>
<span class="s0">who yet was dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry</span>
<span class="s0">for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry.</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that</span>
<span class="s0">hand, speaking of the princess' sorrow and making herself a partner in</span>
<span class="s0">it. She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess</span>
<span class="s0">allowed her to share her sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings</span>
<span class="s0">should sink into nothing but this great grief; that she felt herself</span>
<span class="s0">blameless in regard to everyone, and that he, from above, saw her</span>
<span class="s0">affection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not heeding her words</span>
<span class="s0">but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her</span>
<span class="s0">voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,&quot; said Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne after a pause. &quot;I understand that you could not, and cannot,</span>
<span class="s0">think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go</span>
<span class="s0">or where to. &quot;Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it</span>
<span class="s0">not all the same?&quot; she thought, and did not reply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know, chere Marie,&quot; said Mademoiselle Bourienne, &quot;that we are</span>
<span class="s0">in danger--are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move</span>
<span class="s0">now. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God</span>
<span class="s0">knows...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she</span>
<span class="s0">was talking about.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">said. &quot;Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him....</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do</span>
<span class="s0">nothing, nothing, and don't want to....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I've spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay here,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne. &quot;Because, you will agree, chere Marie, to fall</span>
<span class="s0">into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be</span>
<span class="s0">terrible.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not</span>
<span class="s0">printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau's, telling people</span>
<span class="s0">not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would</span>
<span class="s0">afford them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think it would be best to appeal to that general,&quot; she continued,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;and and am sure that all due respect would be shown you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with</span>
<span class="s0">stifled sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;From whom did you get this?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window</span>
<span class="s0">and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's study.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dunyasha, send Alpatych, or Dronushka, or somebody to me!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">said, &quot;and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">added, hearing Mademoiselle Bourienne's voice. &quot;We must go at once, at</span>
<span class="s0">once!&quot; she said, appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of</span>
<span class="s0">the French.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French!</span>
<span class="s0">That I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, asked General</span>
<span class="s0">Rameau for protection and accepted his favor!&quot; This idea horrified</span>
<span class="s0">her, made her shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and</span>
<span class="s0">pride as she had never experienced before. All that was distressing,</span>
<span class="s0">and especially all that was humiliating, in her position rose</span>
<span class="s0">vividly to her mind. &quot;They, the French, would settle in this house: M.</span>
<span class="s0">le General Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew's study and amuse himself</span>
<span class="s0">by looking through and reading his letters and papers. Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne would do the honors of Bogucharovo for him. I should be</span>
<span class="s0">given a small room as a favor, the soldiers would violate my</span>
<span class="s0">father's newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars, they would</span>
<span class="s0">tell me of their victories over the Russians, and would pretend to</span>
<span class="s0">sympathize with my sorrow...&quot; thought Princess Mary, not thinking</span>
<span class="s0">her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her</span>
<span class="s0">brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what</span>
<span class="s0">happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead</span>
<span class="s0">father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what</span>
<span class="s0">they would have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's study, trying to enter completely into his ideas,</span>
<span class="s0">and considered her position.</span>

<span class="s0">The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her</span>
<span class="s0">father's death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously</span>
<span class="s0">unknown force and took possession of her.</span>

<span class="s0">Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovich and now for Tikhon or Dron. Dunyasha, the nurse, and the</span>
<span class="s0">other maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne's</span>
<span class="s0">statement was correct. Alpatych was not at home, he had gone to the</span>
<span class="s0">police. Neither could the architect Michael Ivanovich, who on being</span>
<span class="s0">sent for came in with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With</span>
<span class="s0">just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had</span>
<span class="s0">been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of</span>
<span class="s0">his own, he now replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite</span>
<span class="s0">could be got from his answers. The old valet Tikhon, with sunken,</span>
<span class="s0">emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief, replied:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Princess&quot; to all Princess Mary's questions and hardly</span>
<span class="s0">refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.</span>

<span class="s0">At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a</span>
<span class="s0">deep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dronushka,&quot; she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dronushka who</span>
<span class="s0">always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to</span>
<span class="s0">the fair at Vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Dronushka, now since our misfortune...&quot; she began, but could not go</span>
<span class="s0">on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We are all in God's hands,&quot; said he, with a sigh.</span>

<span class="s0">They were silent for a while.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dronushka, Alpatych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to</span>
<span class="s0">turn to. Is true, as they tell me, that I can't even go away?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why shouldn't you go away, your excellency? You can go,&quot; said Dron.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend,</span>
<span class="s0">I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go</span>
<span class="s0">away tonight or early tomorrow morning.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: &quot;There are</span>
<span class="s0">no horses; I told Yakov Alpatych so.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why are there none?&quot; asked the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's all God's scourge,&quot; said Dron. &quot;What horses we had have been</span>
<span class="s0">taken for the army or have died--this is such a year! It's not a</span>
<span class="s0">case of feeding horses--we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some</span>
<span class="s0">go three days without eating. We've nothing, we've been ruined.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They're dying of hunger,&quot; said Dron. &quot;It's not a case of carting.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why didn't you tell me, Dronushka? Isn't it possible to help</span>
<span class="s0">them? I'll do all I can....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such</span>
<span class="s0">sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor,</span>
<span class="s0">and the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard</span>
<span class="s0">vaguely that there was such a thing as &quot;landlord's corn&quot; which was</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes given to the peasants. She also knew that neither her father</span>
<span class="s0">nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need, she only</span>
<span class="s0">feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of</span>
<span class="s0">the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares presented</span>
<span class="s0">themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief.</span>
<span class="s0">She began asking Dron about the peasants' needs and what there was</span>
<span class="s0">in Bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But we have grain belonging to my brother?&quot; she said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The landlord's grain is all safe,&quot; replied Dron proudly. &quot;Our</span>
<span class="s0">prince did not order it to be sold.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you</span>
<span class="s0">leave in my brother's name,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all.</span>
<span class="s0">I give this order in my brother's name; and tell them that what is</span>
<span class="s0">ours is theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Discharge me, little mother, for God's sake! Order the keys to be</span>
<span class="s0">taken from me,&quot; said he. &quot;I have served twenty-three years and have</span>
<span class="s0">done no wrong. Discharge me, for God's sake!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was</span>
<span class="s0">asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his</span>
<span class="s0">devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the</span>
<span class="s0">peasants.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">An hour later Dunyasha came to tell the princess that Dron had come,</span>
<span class="s0">and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess'</span>
<span class="s0">order and wished to have word with their mistress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I never told them to come,&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;I only told</span>
<span class="s0">Dron to let them have the grain.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Only, for God's sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and</span>
<span class="s0">don't go out to them. It's all a trick,&quot; said Dunyasha, &quot;and when</span>
<span class="s0">Yakov Alpatych returns let us get away... and please don't...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is a trick?&quot; asked Princess Mary in surprise.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know it is, only listen to me for God's sake! Ask nurse too. They</span>
<span class="s0">say they don't agree to leave Bogucharovo as you ordered.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Princess Mary. &quot;Call Dronushka.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dron came and confirmed Dunyasha's words; the peasants had come by</span>
<span class="s0">the princess' order.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I never sent for them,&quot; declared the princess. &quot;You must have</span>
<span class="s0">given my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the</span>
<span class="s0">grain.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dron only sighed in reply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If you order it they will go away,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, no. I'll go out to them,&quot; said Princess Mary, and in spite of</span>
<span class="s0">the nurse's and Dunyasha's protests she went out into the porch; Dron,</span>
<span class="s0">Dunyasha, the nurse, and Michael Ivanovich following her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to</span>
<span class="s0">remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the</span>
<span class="s0">French,&quot; thought Princess Mary. &quot;I will offer them monthly rations and</span>
<span class="s0">housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in</span>
<span class="s0">my place,&quot; she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd standing on the pasture by the barn.</span>

<span class="s0">The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their</span>
<span class="s0">hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt,</span>
<span class="s0">came close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were</span>
<span class="s0">fixed on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could</span>
<span class="s0">not distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them</span>
<span class="s0">all at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she</span>
<span class="s0">represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she</span>
<span class="s0">boldly began her speech.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am very glad you have come,&quot; she said without raising her eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. &quot;Dronushka</span>
<span class="s0">tells me that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune,</span>
<span class="s0">and I shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because</span>
<span class="s0">it is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving</span>
<span class="s0">you everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all</span>
<span class="s0">our grain, so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been</span>
<span class="s0">told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here--that is not</span>
<span class="s0">true. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our</span>
<span class="s0">estate near Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there</span>
<span class="s0">you shall want for nothing. You shall be given food and lodging.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am not doing this on my own account,&quot; she continued, &quot;I do it</span>
<span class="s0">in the name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my</span>
<span class="s0">brother and his son.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again she paused. No one broke the silence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that</span>
<span class="s0">is mine is yours,&quot; she concluded, scanning the faces before her.</span>

<span class="s0">All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She</span>
<span class="s0">could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or</span>
<span class="s0">apprehension and distrust--but the expression on all the faces was</span>
<span class="s0">identical.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won't do for us to</span>
<span class="s0">take the landlord's grain,&quot; said a voice at the back of the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why not?&quot; asked the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd,</span>
<span class="s0">found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why don't you want to take it?&quot; she asked again.</span>

<span class="s0">No one answered.</span>

<span class="s0">The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch</span>
<span class="s0">someone's eye.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why don't you speak?&quot; she inquired of a very old man who stood just</span>
<span class="s0">in front of her leaning on his stick. &quot;If you think something more</span>
<span class="s0">is wanted, tell me! I will do anything,&quot; said she, catching his eye.</span>

<span class="s0">But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why should we agree? We don't want the grain.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why should we give up everything? We don't agree. Don't agree....</span>
<span class="s0">We are sorry for you, but we're not willing. Go away yourself,</span>
<span class="s0">alone...&quot; came from various sides of the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical</span>
<span class="s0">expression, though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity</span>
<span class="s0">or gratitude, but of angry resolve.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you can't have understood me,&quot; said Princess Mary with a sad</span>
<span class="s0">smile. &quot;Why don't you want to go? I promise to house and feed you,</span>
<span class="s0">while here the enemy would ruin you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We're not willing. Let them ruin us! We won't take your grain. We</span>
<span class="s0">don't agree.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone's eye, but not a single</span>
<span class="s0">eye in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying</span>
<span class="s0">to avoid her look. She felt strange and awkward.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your</span>
<span class="s0">houses and go into bondage! I dare say! 'I'll give you grain, indeed!'</span>
<span class="s0">she says,&quot; voices in the crowd were heard saying.</span>

<span class="s0">With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the</span>
<span class="s0">house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for</span>
<span class="s0">her departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone</span>
<span class="s0">with her own thoughts.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of</span>
<span class="s0">her room hearing the sound of the peasants' voices that reached her</span>
<span class="s0">from the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt</span>
<span class="s0">that she could not understand them however much she might think</span>
<span class="s0">about them. She thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after</span>
<span class="s0">the break caused by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to</span>
<span class="s0">the past. Now she could remember it and weep or pray.</span>

<span class="s0">After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh.</span>
<span class="s0">Toward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full</span>
<span class="s0">moon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist</span>
<span class="s0">began to rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.</span>

<span class="s0">Pictures of the near past--her father's illness and last moments-</span>
<span class="s0">rose one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now</span>
<span class="s0">lingered over these images, repelling with horror only the last one,</span>
<span class="s0">the picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate</span>
<span class="s0">even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And</span>
<span class="s0">these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such</span>
<span class="s0">detail that they seemed now present, now past, and now future.</span>

<span class="s0">She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was</span>
<span class="s0">being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,</span>
<span class="s0">muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray</span>
<span class="s0">eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she thought. &quot;He had always thought what he said then.&quot; And she</span>
<span class="s0">recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the</span>
<span class="s0">last stroke, when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at</span>
<span class="s0">home against his will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs</span>
<span class="s0">on tiptoe, and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept</span>
<span class="s0">that night had listened at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he</span>
<span class="s0">was saying something to Tikhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm</span>
<span class="s0">nights and of the Empress. Evidently he had wanted to talk. &quot;And why</span>
<span class="s0">didn't he call me? Why didn't he let me be there instead of Tikhon?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary had thought and thought again now. &quot;Now he will never</span>
<span class="s0">tell anyone what he had in his soul. Never will that moment return for</span>
<span class="s0">him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say, and not</span>
<span class="s0">Tikhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn't I enter</span>
<span class="s0">the room?&quot; she thought. &quot;Perhaps he would then have said to me what he</span>
<span class="s0">said the day he died. While talking to Tikhon he asked about me twice.</span>
<span class="s0">He wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door. It</span>
<span class="s0">was sad and painful for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand</span>
<span class="s0">him. I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were</span>
<span class="s0">alive--he had forgotten she was dead--and Tikhon reminded him that she</span>
<span class="s0">was no more, and he shouted, 'Fool!' He was greatly depressed. From</span>
<span class="s0">behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly</span>
<span class="s0">exclaimed, 'My God!' Why didn't I go in then? What could he have</span>
<span class="s0">done to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps he would then have</span>
<span class="s0">been comforted and would have said that word to me.&quot; And Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of</span>
<span class="s0">his death. &quot;Dear-est!&quot; she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears</span>
<span class="s0">that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the</span>
<span class="s0">face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen</span>
<span class="s0">at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first</span>
<span class="s0">time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details, when she</span>
<span class="s0">stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear-est!&quot; she repeated again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking</span>
<span class="s0">now?&quot; This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer</span>
<span class="s0">she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as</span>
<span class="s0">he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief.</span>
<span class="s0">And the horror that had seized her when she touched him and</span>
<span class="s0">convinced herself that that was not he, but something mysterious and</span>
<span class="s0">horrible, seized her again. She tried to think of something else and</span>
<span class="s0">to pray, but could do neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the</span>
<span class="s0">moonlight and the shadows, expecting every moment to see his dead</span>
<span class="s0">face, and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within</span>
<span class="s0">it held her fast.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dunyasha,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Dunyasha!&quot; she screamed wildly, and</span>
<span class="s0">tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants'</span>
<span class="s0">quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running</span>
<span class="s0">toward her.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">On the seventeenth of August Rostov and Ilyin, accompanied by</span>
<span class="s0">Lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar</span>
<span class="s0">orderly, left their quarters at Yankovo, ten miles from Bogucharovo,</span>
<span class="s0">and went for a ride--to try a new horse Ilyin had bought and to find</span>
<span class="s0">out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages.</span>

<span class="s0">For the last three days Bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile</span>
<span class="s0">armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to</span>
<span class="s0">it as for the French vanguard; Rostov, as a careful squadron</span>
<span class="s0">commander, wished to take such provisions as remained at Bogucharovo</span>
<span class="s0">before the French could get them.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods. On the way to</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where</span>
<span class="s0">they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they</span>
<span class="s0">questioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and</span>
<span class="s0">raced one another to try Ilyin's horse.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property</span>
<span class="s0">of that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the</span>
<span class="s0">incline before reaching Bogucharovo, and Rostov, outstripping Ilyin,</span>
<span class="s0">was the first to gallop into the village street.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're first!&quot; cried Ilyin, flushed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,&quot; answered Rostov,</span>
<span class="s0">stroking his heated Donets horse.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I'd have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,&quot; said Lavrushka</span>
<span class="s0">from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, &quot;only I didn't wish to</span>
<span class="s0">mortify you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants</span>
<span class="s0">was standing.</span>

<span class="s0">Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals</span>
<span class="s0">without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled</span>
<span class="s0">faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling,</span>
<span class="s0">staggering, and singing some incoherent song, and approached the</span>
<span class="s0">officers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fine fellows!&quot; said Rostov laughing. &quot;Is there any hay here?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how like one another,&quot; said Ilyin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!&quot; sang one of the peasants with a</span>
<span class="s0">blissful smile.</span>

<span class="s0">One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who do you belong to?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The French,&quot; replied Ilyin jestingly, &quot;and here is Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">himself&quot;--and he pointed to Lavrushka.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then you are Russians?&quot; the peasant asked again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And is there a large force of you here?&quot; said another, a short man,</span>
<span class="s0">coming up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very large,&quot; answered Rostov. &quot;But why have you collected here?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">added. &quot;Is it a holiday?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">replied the peasant, moving away.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women</span>
<span class="s0">and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The one in pink is mine, so keep off!&quot; said Ilyin on seeing</span>
<span class="s0">Dunyasha running resolutely toward him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She'll be ours!&quot; said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What do you want, my pretty?&quot; said Ilyin with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am your humble</span>
<span class="s0">servant.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Co-o-om-pa-ny!&quot; roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as</span>
<span class="s0">he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl. Following Dunyasha, Alpatych</span>
<span class="s0">advanced to Rostov, having bared his head while still at a distance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May I make bold to trouble your honor?&quot; said he respectfully, but</span>
<span class="s0">with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with</span>
<span class="s0">a hand thrust into his bosom. &quot;My mistress, daughter of General in</span>
<span class="s0">Chief Prince Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this</span>
<span class="s0">month, finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of</span>
<span class="s0">these people&quot;--he pointed to the peasants--&quot;asks you to come up to the</span>
<span class="s0">house.... Won't you, please, ride on a little farther,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych with a melancholy smile, &quot;as it is not convenient in the</span>
<span class="s0">presence of...?&quot; He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to</span>
<span class="s0">him as horseflies to a horse.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah!... Alpatych... Ah, Yakov Alpatych... Grand! Forgive us for</span>
<span class="s0">Christ's sake, eh?&quot; said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Or perhaps they amuse your honor?&quot; remarked Alpatych with a staid</span>
<span class="s0">air, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, there's not much to be amused at here,&quot; said Rostov, and rode</span>
<span class="s0">on a little way. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here</span>
<span class="s0">don't wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to</span>
<span class="s0">unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up</span>
<span class="s0">since morning, her excellency cannot get away.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Impossible!&quot; exclaimed Rostov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,&quot; said Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed</span>
<span class="s0">Alpatych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs.</span>
<span class="s0">It appeared that the princess' offer of corn to the peasants the</span>
<span class="s0">previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had</span>
<span class="s0">actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the</span>
<span class="s0">keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent</span>
<span class="s0">for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to</span>
<span class="s0">harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the</span>
<span class="s0">barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that</span>
<span class="s0">there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the</span>
<span class="s0">horses. Alpatych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was</span>
<span class="s0">chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that there was an</span>
<span class="s0">order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her</span>
<span class="s0">as before and obey her in everything.</span>

<span class="s0">At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road,</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her nurse, and the</span>
<span class="s0">maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the</span>
<span class="s0">cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran</span>
<span class="s0">away, and the women in the house began to wail.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!&quot; exclaimed deeply moved</span>
<span class="s0">voices as Rostov passed through the anteroom.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large</span>
<span class="s0">sitting room, when Rostov was shown in. She could not grasp who he was</span>
<span class="s0">and why he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his</span>
<span class="s0">Russian face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered</span>
<span class="s0">recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at him with</span>
<span class="s0">her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered</span>
<span class="s0">and trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately struck Rostov as a</span>
<span class="s0">romantic event. &quot;A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the</span>
<span class="s0">mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me</span>
<span class="s0">here! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and</span>
<span class="s0">expression!&quot; thought he as he looked at her and listened to her</span>
<span class="s0">timid story.</span>

<span class="s0">When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day</span>
<span class="s0">after her father's funeral, her voiced trembled. She turned away,</span>
<span class="s0">and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him</span>
<span class="s0">to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There</span>
<span class="s0">were tears in Rostov's eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced</span>
<span class="s0">gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of</span>
<span class="s0">her face to be forgotten.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride</span>
<span class="s0">here and am able to show my readiness to serve you,&quot; said Rostov,</span>
<span class="s0">rising. &quot;Go when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no</span>
<span class="s0">one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act</span>
<span class="s0">as your escort.&quot; And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal</span>
<span class="s0">blood, he moved toward the door.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would</span>
<span class="s0">consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to</span>
<span class="s0">take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am very, very grateful to you,&quot; she said in French, &quot;but I hope</span>
<span class="s0">it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.&quot; She</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Excuse me!&quot; she said.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend--my pink one is delicious; her</span>
<span class="s0">name is Dunyasha....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But on glancing at Rostov's face Ilyin stopped short. He saw that</span>
<span class="s0">his hero and commander was following quite a different train of</span>
<span class="s0">thought.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with</span>
<span class="s0">rapid steps to the village.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll show them; I'll give it to them, the brigands!&quot; said he to</span>
<span class="s0">himself.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up</span>
<span class="s0">with him with difficulty.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What decision have you been pleased to come to?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned</span>
<span class="s0">on Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...&quot; cried he. &quot;What have you</span>
<span class="s0">been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can't manage them?</span>
<span class="s0">You're a traitor yourself! I know you. I'll flay you all alive!...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpatych and</span>
<span class="s0">went rapidly forward. Alpatych, mastering his offended feelings,</span>
<span class="s0">kept pace with Rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his</span>
<span class="s0">views. He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present</span>
<span class="s0">moment it would be imprudent to &quot;overresist&quot; them without an armed</span>
<span class="s0">force, and would it not be better first to send for the military?</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll give them armed force... I'll 'overresist' them!&quot; uttered</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the</span>
<span class="s0">need to vent it.</span>

<span class="s0">Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with</span>
<span class="s0">quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it</span>
<span class="s0">the more Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce</span>
<span class="s0">good results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed</span>
<span class="s0">when they saw Rostov's rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.</span>

<span class="s0">After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone to see</span>
<span class="s0">the princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among</span>
<span class="s0">the crowd. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were</span>
<span class="s0">Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained.</span>
<span class="s0">Dron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and</span>
<span class="s0">others attacked their ex-Elder.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How many years have you been fattening on the commune?&quot; Karp</span>
<span class="s0">shouted at him. &quot;It's all one to you! You'll dig up your pot of</span>
<span class="s0">money and take it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether</span>
<span class="s0">our homes are ruined or not?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We've been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their</span>
<span class="s0">homes or take away a single grain, and that's all about it!&quot; cried</span>
<span class="s0">another.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It was your son's turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You</span>
<span class="s0">begrudged your lump of a son,&quot; a little old man suddenly began</span>
<span class="s0">attacking Dron--&quot;and so they took my Vanka to be shaved for a soldier!</span>
<span class="s0">But we all have to die.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To be sure, we all have to die. I'm not against the commune,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Dron.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's it--not against it! You've filled your belly....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostov, followed</span>
<span class="s0">by Ilyin, Lavrushka, and Alpatych, came up to the crowd, Karp,</span>
<span class="s0">thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to</span>
<span class="s0">the front. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew</span>
<span class="s0">closer together.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who is your Elder here? Hey?&quot; shouted Rostov, coming up to the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd with quick steps.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Elder? What do you want with him?...&quot; asked Karp.</span>

<span class="s0">But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off</span>
<span class="s0">and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Caps off, traitors!&quot; shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice. &quot;Where's</span>
<span class="s0">the Elder?&quot; he cried furiously.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakharych, you!&quot; meek and</span>
<span class="s0">flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to</span>
<span class="s0">come off their heads.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We don't riot, we're following the orders,&quot; declared Karp, and at</span>
<span class="s0">that moment several voices began speaking together.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's as the old men have decided--there's too many of you giving</span>
<span class="s0">orders.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!&quot; cried Rostov unmeaningly</span>
<span class="s0">in a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. &quot;Bind him, bind</span>
<span class="s0">him!&quot; he shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka</span>
<span class="s0">and Alpatych.</span>

<span class="s0">Lavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from</span>
<span class="s0">behind.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?&quot; he called out.</span>

<span class="s0">Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to</span>
<span class="s0">come and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began</span>
<span class="s0">taking off their belts.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where's the Elder?&quot; demanded Rostov in a loud voice.</span>

<span class="s0">With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushka!&quot; shouted Rostov, as if that</span>
<span class="s0">order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.</span>

<span class="s0">And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his</span>
<span class="s0">own belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And you all listen to me!&quot; said Rostov to the peasants. &quot;Be off</span>
<span class="s0">to your houses at once, and don't let one of your voices be heard!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, we've not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness.</span>
<span class="s0">It's all nonsense... I said then that it was not in order,&quot; voices</span>
<span class="s0">were heard bickering with one another.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There! What did I say?&quot; said Alpatych, coming into his own again.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;It's wrong, lads!&quot;</span>

 <span class="s0">&quot;All our stupidity, Yakov Alpatych,&quot; came the answers, and the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd began at once to disperse through the village.</span>

<span class="s0">The two bound men were led off to the master's house. The two</span>
<span class="s0">drunken peasants followed them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Aye, when I look at you!...&quot; said one of them to Karp.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking</span>
<span class="s0">of, you fool?&quot; added the other--&quot;A real fool!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the</span>
<span class="s0">Bogucharovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the</span>
<span class="s0">proprietor's goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron,</span>
<span class="s0">liberated at Princess Mary's wish from the cupboard where he had</span>
<span class="s0">been confined, was standing in the yard directing the men.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't put it in so carelessly,&quot; said one of the peasants, a man</span>
<span class="s0">with a round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. &quot;You know</span>
<span class="s0">it has cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under</span>
<span class="s0">the cord where it'll get rubbed? I don't like that way of doing</span>
<span class="s0">things. Let it all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put</span>
<span class="s0">it under the bast matting and cover it with hay--that's the way!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, books, books!&quot; said another peasant, bringing out Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's library cupboards. &quot;Don't catch up against it! It's heavy,</span>
<span class="s0">lads--solid books.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, they worked all day and didn't play!&quot; remarked the tall,</span>
<span class="s0">round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the</span>
<span class="s0">dictionaries that were on the top.</span>


<span class="s0">Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostov did not go back</span>
<span class="s0">to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure.</span>
<span class="s0">When her carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied</span>
<span class="s0">her eight miles from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our</span>
<span class="s0">troops. At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave of her, for</span>
<span class="s0">the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can you speak so!&quot; he blushingly replied to Princess Mary's</span>
<span class="s0">expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had</span>
<span class="s0">occurred. &quot;Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had</span>
<span class="s0">only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. &quot;I am</span>
<span class="s0">only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.</span>
<span class="s0">Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to</span>
<span class="s0">meet you again in happier circumstances. If you don't want to make</span>
<span class="s0">me blush, please don't thank me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked</span>
<span class="s0">him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude</span>
<span class="s0">and tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to</span>
<span class="s0">thank him for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he</span>
<span class="s0">not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers</span>
<span class="s0">and of the French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and</span>
<span class="s0">obvious danger to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a</span>
<span class="s0">man of lofty and noble soul, able to understand her position and her</span>
<span class="s0">sorrow. His kind, honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when</span>
<span class="s0">she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss, did leave her</span>
<span class="s0">memory.</span>

<span class="s0">When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt</span>
<span class="s0">her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the</span>
<span class="s0">strange question presented itself to her: did she love him?</span>

<span class="s0">On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess' position</span>
<span class="s0">was not a cheerful one, Dunyasha, who went with her in the carriage,</span>
<span class="s0">more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window</span>
<span class="s0">and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, supposing I do love him?&quot; thought Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen</span>
<span class="s0">in love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted</span>
<span class="s0">herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she</span>
<span class="s0">would not be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she</span>
<span class="s0">continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had</span>
<span class="s0">fallen in love for the first and last time in her life.</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his</span>
<span class="s0">words, happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those</span>
<span class="s0">moments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the</span>
<span class="s0">carriage window.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo, and at that very</span>
<span class="s0">moment?&quot; thought Princess Mary. &quot;And that caused his sister to</span>
<span class="s0">refuse my brother?&quot; And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of</span>
<span class="s0">Providence.</span>

<span class="s0">The impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable one.</span>
<span class="s0">To remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of</span>
<span class="s0">his adventure at Bogucharovo, rallied him on having gone to look for</span>
<span class="s0">hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he</span>
<span class="s0">grew angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the</span>
<span class="s0">gentle Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous</span>
<span class="s0">fortune, had against his will more than once entered his head. For</span>
<span class="s0">himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by</span>
<span class="s0">marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be</span>
<span class="s0">able to put his father's affairs in order, and would even--he felt it-</span>
<span class="s0">ensure Princess Mary's happiness.</span>

<span class="s0">But Sonya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostov grew angry</span>
<span class="s0">when he was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">On receiving command of the armies Kutuzov remembered Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew arrived at Tsarevo-Zaymishche on the very day and at</span>
<span class="s0">the very hour that Kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first</span>
<span class="s0">time. He stopped in the village at the priest's house in front of</span>
<span class="s0">which stood the commander in chief's carriage, and he sat down on</span>
<span class="s0">the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now</span>
<span class="s0">called Kutuzov. From the field beyond the village came now sounds of</span>
<span class="s0">regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot; to</span>
<span class="s0">the new commander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo,</span>
<span class="s0">stood near by, some ten paces from Prince Andrew, availing</span>
<span class="s0">themselves of Kutuzov's absence and of the fine weather. A short,</span>
<span class="s0">swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and</span>
<span class="s0">whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew,</span>
<span class="s0">inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and</span>
<span class="s0">whether he would soon be back.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness'</span>
<span class="s0">staff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned</span>
<span class="s0">to a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief's orderly speaks to officers, replied:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? His Serene Highness? I expect he'll be here soon. What do you</span>
<span class="s0">want?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the</span>
<span class="s0">orderly's tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and</span>
<span class="s0">approached Bolkonski with a slight bow. Bolkonski made room for him on</span>
<span class="s0">the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're also waiting for the commander in chief?&quot; said he. &quot;They say</span>
<span class="s0">he weceives evewyone, thank God!... It's awful with those sausage</span>
<span class="s0">eaters! Ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now</span>
<span class="s0">p'waps Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what</span>
<span class="s0">was happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in</span>
<span class="s0">the campaign?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I had the pleasure,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, &quot;not only of taking</span>
<span class="s0">part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear--not</span>
<span class="s0">to mention the estate and home of my birth--my father, who died of</span>
<span class="s0">grief. I belong to the province of Smolensk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah? You're Pwince Bolkonski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance!</span>
<span class="s0">I'm Lieutenant Colonel Denisov, better known as 'Vaska,'&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov, pressing Prince Andrew's hand and looking into his face</span>
<span class="s0">with a particularly kindly attention. &quot;Yes, I heard,&quot; said he</span>
<span class="s0">sympathetically, and after a short pause added: &quot;Yes, it's Scythian</span>
<span class="s0">warfare. It's all vewy well--only not for those who get it in the</span>
<span class="s0">neck. So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkonski?&quot; He swayed his head. &quot;Vewy</span>
<span class="s0">pleased, Pwince, to make your acquaintance!&quot; he repeated again,</span>
<span class="s0">smiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince Andrew's hand.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him of her</span>
<span class="s0">first suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to</span>
<span class="s0">those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which</span>
<span class="s0">still found place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and</span>
<span class="s0">very serious impressions--such as the retreat from Smolensk, his visit</span>
<span class="s0">to Bald Hills, and the recent news of his father's death--and had</span>
<span class="s0">experienced so many emotions, that for a long time past those memories</span>
<span class="s0">had not entered his mind, and now that they did, they did not act on</span>
<span class="s0">him with nearly their former strength. For Denisov, too, the</span>
<span class="s0">memories awakened by the name of Bolkonski belonged to a distant,</span>
<span class="s0">romantic past, when after supper and after Natasha's singing he had</span>
<span class="s0">proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was</span>
<span class="s0">doing. He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love</span>
<span class="s0">for Natasha, and passed at once to what now interested him</span>
<span class="s0">passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign he had</span>
<span class="s0">devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had</span>
<span class="s0">proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line of</span>
<span class="s0">operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or</span>
<span class="s0">concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the</span>
<span class="s0">French, we should attack their line of communication. He began</span>
<span class="s0">explaining his plan to Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They can't hold all that line. It's impossible. I will undertake to</span>
<span class="s0">bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,</span>
<span class="s0">that's certain! There's only one way--guewilla warfare!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkonski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from</span>
<span class="s0">the army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with</span>
<span class="s0">music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held.</span>
<span class="s0">Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's coming! He's coming!&quot; shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.</span>

<span class="s0">Bolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutuzov coming down</span>
<span class="s0">the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of</span>
<span class="s0">generals rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and</span>
<span class="s0">a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting, &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutuzov was</span>
<span class="s0">impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his</span>
<span class="s0">weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard's cap with a</span>
<span class="s0">red band and no peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to</span>
<span class="s0">the guard of honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing</span>
<span class="s0">decorations, who were giving him the salute, he looked at them</span>
<span class="s0">silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a</span>
<span class="s0">commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers</span>
<span class="s0">surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression, he</span>
<span class="s0">shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,</span>
<span class="s0">General,&quot; he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&quot; shouted those behind him.</span>

<span class="s0">Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had grown still more</span>
<span class="s0">corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and</span>
<span class="s0">the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was</span>
<span class="s0">wearing the white Horse Guard's cap and a military overcoat with a</span>
<span class="s0">whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and</span>
<span class="s0">swayed limply on his brisk little horse.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whew... whew... whew!&quot; he whistled just audibly as he rode into the</span>
<span class="s0">yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man</span>
<span class="s0">who means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the</span>
<span class="s0">stirrup and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face</span>
<span class="s0">with the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned</span>
<span class="s0">on his knee, groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks</span>
<span class="s0">and adjutants who stood ready to assist him.</span>

<span class="s0">He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">glanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved</span>
<span class="s0">with his waddling gait to the porch. &quot;Whew... whew... whew!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old</span>
<span class="s0">men, it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's face linked itself up with Kutuzov's remembrance of</span>
<span class="s0">his personality.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come</span>
<span class="s0">along...&quot; said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the</span>
<span class="s0">porch which creaked under his weight.</span>

<span class="s0">He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how's your father?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I received news of his death, yesterday,&quot; replied Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">abruptly.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then</span>
<span class="s0">took off his cap and crossed himself:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God's will be done to us all!&quot; He</span>
<span class="s0">sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my</span>
<span class="s0">heart.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for</span>
<span class="s0">some time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw</span>
<span class="s0">that Kutuzov's flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise</span>
<span class="s0">himself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come! Come with me, we'll have a talk,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">But at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by his superiors</span>
<span class="s0">than by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch,</span>
<span class="s0">despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him.</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly.</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov, having given his name, announced that he had to communicate</span>
<span class="s0">to his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their</span>
<span class="s0">country's welfare. Kutuzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his</span>
<span class="s0">hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded them across his stomach,</span>
<span class="s0">repeating the words: &quot;For our country's welfare? Well, what is it?</span>
<span class="s0">Speak!&quot; Denisov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see the color</span>
<span class="s0">rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly began to</span>
<span class="s0">expound his plan of cutting the enemy's lines of communication between</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk and Vyazma. Denisov came from those parts and knew the</span>
<span class="s0">country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from</span>
<span class="s0">the strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutuzov looked down at</span>
<span class="s0">his own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut</span>
<span class="s0">as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from</span>
<span class="s0">that hut, while Denisov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under</span>
<span class="s0">his arm really did appear.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What?&quot; said Kutuzov, in the midst of Denisov's explanations, &quot;are</span>
<span class="s0">you ready so soon?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ready, your Serene Highness,&quot; replied the general.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: &quot;How is one man to</span>
<span class="s0">deal with it all?&quot; and again listened to Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,&quot; said Denisov,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;that I can bweak Napoleon's line of communication!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov?&quot; asked Kutuzov, interrupting him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, we were friends,&quot; said Kutuzov cheerfully. &quot;All right, all</span>
<span class="s0">right, friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we'll have a talk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the</span>
<span class="s0">papers Konovnitsyn had brought him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">general on duty in a discontented voice, &quot;the plans must be examined</span>
<span class="s0">and several papers have to be signed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in</span>
<span class="s0">readiness within. But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that</span>
<span class="s0">room till he was disengaged. He made a grimace...</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I'll</span>
<span class="s0">look at them here,&quot; said he. &quot;Don't go away,&quot; he added, turning to</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general's</span>
<span class="s0">report.</span>

<span class="s0">While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a</span>
<span class="s0">woman's voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door.</span>
<span class="s0">Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a</span>
<span class="s0">plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief</span>
<span class="s0">on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief. Kutuzov's adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was, and that she</span>
<span class="s0">intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt. &quot;Her husband has</span>
<span class="s0">welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church, and she</span>
<span class="s0">intends to welcome him in the house.... She's very pretty,&quot; added</span>
<span class="s0">the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutuzov looked round. He was</span>
<span class="s0">listening to the general's report--which consisted chiefly of a</span>
<span class="s0">criticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zaymishche--as he had listened to</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov, and seven years previously had listened to the discussion</span>
<span class="s0">at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only because</span>
<span class="s0">he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them,</span>
<span class="s0">could not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general</span>
<span class="s0">could say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that</span>
<span class="s0">would be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to,</span>
<span class="s0">as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All</span>
<span class="s0">that Denisov had said was clever and to the point. What the general</span>
<span class="s0">was saying was even more clever and to the point, but it was evident</span>
<span class="s0">that Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness, and knew of</span>
<span class="s0">something else that would decide the matter--something independent</span>
<span class="s0">of cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the commander</span>
<span class="s0">in chief's face attentively, and the only expression he could see</span>
<span class="s0">there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the</span>
<span class="s0">feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe</span>
<span class="s0">propriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and</span>
<span class="s0">learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but despised</span>
<span class="s0">them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge--he</span>
<span class="s0">did not try to display any of these--but because of something else. He</span>
<span class="s0">despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The</span>
<span class="s0">only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report</span>
<span class="s0">referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report</span>
<span class="s0">the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the</span>
<span class="s0">recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by</span>
<span class="s0">the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation.</span>

<span class="s0">After hearing the matter, Kutuzov smacked his lips together and</span>
<span class="s0">shook his head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear fellow,&quot; said he, &quot;into the fire with all such things! Let</span>
<span class="s0">them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts' content. I don't</span>
<span class="s0">order it or allow it, but I don't exact compensation either. One can't</span>
<span class="s0">get on without it. 'When wood is chopped the chips will fly.'&quot; He</span>
<span class="s0">looked at the paper again. &quot;Oh, this German precision!&quot; he muttered,</span>
<span class="s0">shaking his head.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Well, that's all!&quot; said Kutuzov as he signed the last of the</span>
<span class="s0">documents, and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat</span>
<span class="s0">white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.</span>

<span class="s0">The priest's wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had</span>
<span class="s0">after all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had</span>
<span class="s0">so long been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and</span>
<span class="s0">said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the</span>
<span class="s0">dish for her. &quot;Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?&quot; he asked,</span>
<span class="s0">moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest's wife</span>
<span class="s0">smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the</span>
<span class="s0">room. The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to</span>
<span class="s0">lunch with him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov. He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same</span>
<span class="s0">unbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he</span>
<span class="s0">closed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife.</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne</span>
<span class="s0">by Madame de Genlis.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, sit down, sit down here. Let's have a talk,&quot; said Kutuzov.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;It's sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a</span>
<span class="s0">father to you, a second father....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of his father's death, and</span>
<span class="s0">what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What... what they have brought us to!&quot; Kutuzov suddenly cried in an</span>
<span class="s0">agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's story the condition Russia was in. &quot;But give me time, give me</span>
<span class="s0">time!&quot; he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue</span>
<span class="s0">this agitating conversation, and added: &quot;I sent for you to keep you</span>
<span class="s0">with me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the</span>
<span class="s0">staff,&quot; replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutuzov noticed.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But above all,&quot; added Prince Andrew, &quot;I have grown used to my</span>
<span class="s0">regiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I</span>
<span class="s0">should be sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being</span>
<span class="s0">with you, believe me...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">podgy face. He cut Bolkonski short.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am sorry, for I need you. But you're right, you're right! It's</span>
<span class="s0">not here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men</span>
<span class="s0">are not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be</span>
<span class="s0">advisers served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I</span>
<span class="s0">remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!&quot; said Kutuzov, and</span>
<span class="s0">a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew's face at this</span>
<span class="s0">recollection.</span>

<span class="s0">Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutuzov offered his cheek</span>
<span class="s0">to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man's</span>
<span class="s0">eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutuzov's tears came easily,</span>
<span class="s0">and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a</span>
<span class="s0">wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz</span>
<span class="s0">was both pleasant and flattering to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of</span>
<span class="s0">honor!&quot; He paused. &quot;I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to</span>
<span class="s0">send.&quot; And changing the subject, Kutuzov began to speak of the Turkish</span>
<span class="s0">war and the peace that had been concluded. &quot;Yes, I have been much</span>
<span class="s0">blamed,&quot; he said, &quot;both for that war and the peace... but everything</span>
<span class="s0">came at the right time. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre.*</span>
<span class="s0">And there were as many advisers there as here...&quot; he went on,</span>
<span class="s0">returning to the subject of &quot;advisers&quot; which evidently occupied him.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, those advisers!&quot; said he. &quot;If we had listened to them all we</span>
<span class="s0">should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been</span>
<span class="s0">through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less</span>
<span class="s0">speed. Kamenski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed</span>
<span class="s0">fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture</span>
<span class="s0">a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, storming</span>
<span class="s0">and attacking but patience and time are wanted. Kamenski sent soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more</span>
<span class="s0">fortresses than Kamenski and made them but eat horseflesh!&quot; He swayed</span>
<span class="s0">his head. &quot;And the French shall too, believe me,&quot; he went on,</span>
<span class="s0">growing warmer and beating his chest, &quot;I'll make them eat horseflesh!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">And tears again dimmed his eyes.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;But shan't we have to accept battle?&quot; remarked Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We shall if everybody wants it; it can't be helped.... But</span>
<span class="s0">believe me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two:</span>
<span class="s0">patience and time, they will do it all. But the advisers n'entendent</span>
<span class="s0">pas de cette oreille, voila le mal.* Some want a thing--others</span>
<span class="s0">don't. What's one to do?&quot; he asked, evidently expecting an answer.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what do you want us to do?&quot; he repeated and his eye shone</span>
<span class="s0">with a deep, shrewd look. &quot;I'll tell you what to do,&quot; he continued, as</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew still did not reply: &quot;I will tell you what to do, and</span>
<span class="s0">what I do. Dans le doute, mon cher,&quot; he paused, &quot;abstiens-toi&quot;*[2]--he</span>
<span class="s0">articulated the French proverb deliberately.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Don't see it that way, that's the trouble.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">*[2] &quot;When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I</span>
<span class="s0">share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor</span>
<span class="s0">a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything</span>
<span class="s0">come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter</span>
<span class="s0">had left the room Kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his</span>
<span class="s0">unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but</span>
<span class="s0">after that interview with Kutuzov he went back to his regiment</span>
<span class="s0">reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to</span>
<span class="s0">whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all</span>
<span class="s0">personal motive in that old man--in whom there seemed to remain only</span>
<span class="s0">the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events</span>
<span class="s0">and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the</span>
<span class="s0">course of events--the more reassured he was that everything would be</span>
<span class="s0">as it should. &quot;He will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not</span>
<span class="s0">devise or undertake anything,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, &quot;but he will</span>
<span class="s0">hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place.</span>
<span class="s0">He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He</span>
<span class="s0">understands that there is something stronger and more important than</span>
<span class="s0">his own will--the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and</span>
<span class="s0">grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain</span>
<span class="s0">from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something</span>
<span class="s0">else. And above all,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, &quot;one believes in him</span>
<span class="s0">because he's Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French</span>
<span class="s0">proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: 'What they have</span>
<span class="s0">brought us to!' and had a sob in it when he said he would 'make them</span>
<span class="s0">eat horseflesh!'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity</span>
<span class="s0">and general approval were founded with which, despite court</span>
<span class="s0">influences, the popular choice of Kutuzov as commander in chief was</span>
<span class="s0">received.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual</span>
<span class="s0">course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to</span>
<span class="s0">remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to</span>
<span class="s0">believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the</span>
<span class="s0">English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">everything for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor</span>
<span class="s0">everyone had displayed during the Emperor's stay was the call for</span>
<span class="s0">contributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the</span>
<span class="s0">promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became</span>
<span class="s0">unavoidable.</span>

<span class="s0">With the enemy's approach to Moscow, the Moscovites' view of their</span>
<span class="s0">situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even</span>
<span class="s0">more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger</span>
<span class="s0">approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices</span>
<span class="s0">that speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably</span>
<span class="s0">tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of</span>
<span class="s0">escaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too</span>
<span class="s0">depressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in</span>
<span class="s0">man's power to foresee everything and avert the general course of</span>
<span class="s0">events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till</span>
<span class="s0">it comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man</span>
<span class="s0">generally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So</span>
<span class="s0">it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people</span>
<span class="s0">had been as gay in Moscow as that year.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostopchin's broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a</span>
<span class="s0">potman, and a Moscow burgher called Karpushka Chigirin, &quot;who--having</span>
<span class="s0">been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub--heard</span>
<span class="s0">that Napoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the</span>
<span class="s0">French in very bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under</span>
<span class="s0">the sign of the eagle, began to address the assembled people,&quot; were</span>
<span class="s0">read and discussed, together with the latest of Vasili Lvovich</span>
<span class="s0">Pushkin's bouts rimes.</span>

<span class="s0">In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these</span>
<span class="s0">broadsheets, and some liked the way Karpushka jeered at the French,</span>
<span class="s0">saying: &quot;They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our</span>
<span class="s0">buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are</span>
<span class="s0">all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a</span>
<span class="s0">hayfork.&quot; Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and</span>
<span class="s0">vulgar. It was said that Rostopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and</span>
<span class="s0">even all foreigners from Moscow, and that there had been some spies</span>
<span class="s0">and agents of Napoleon among them; but this was told chiefly to</span>
<span class="s0">introduce Rostopchin's witty remark on that occasion. The foreigners</span>
<span class="s0">were deported to Nizhni by boat, and Rostopchin had said to them in</span>
<span class="s0">French: &quot;Rentrez en vousmemes; entrez dans la barque, et n'en faites</span>
<span class="s0">pas une barque de Charon.&quot;* There was talk of all the government</span>
<span class="s0">offices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this</span>
<span class="s0">Shinshin's witticism was added--that for that alone Moscow ought to be</span>
<span class="s0">grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamonov's regiment would cost</span>
<span class="s0">him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezukhov had spent even</span>
<span class="s0">more on his, but that the best thing about Bezukhov's action was</span>
<span class="s0">that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his</span>
<span class="s0">regiment without charging anything for the show.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to make it a</span>
<span class="s0">barque of Charon.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;You don't spare anyone,&quot; said Julie Drubetskaya as she collected</span>
<span class="s0">and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed</span>
<span class="s0">fingers.</span>

<span class="s0">Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a</span>
<span class="s0">farewell soiree.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bezukhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure is there to be so caustique?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A forfeit!&quot; cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie</span>
<span class="s0">called &quot;mon chevalier,&quot; and who was going with her to Nizhni.</span>

<span class="s0">In Julie's set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been</span>
<span class="s0">agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who</span>
<span class="s0">made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of</span>
<span class="s0">Voluntary Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Another forfeit for a Gallicism,&quot; said a Russian writer who was</span>
<span class="s0">present. &quot;'What pleasure is there to be' is not Russian!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You spare no one,&quot; continued Julie to the young man without heeding</span>
<span class="s0">the author's remark.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;For caustique--I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay</span>
<span class="s0">again for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I</span>
<span class="s0">won't be responsible,&quot; she remarked, turning to the author: &quot;I have</span>
<span class="s0">neither the money nor the time, like Prince Galitsyn, to engage a</span>
<span class="s0">master to teach me Russian!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, here he is!&quot; she added. &quot;Quand on... No, no,&quot; she said to the</span>
<span class="s0">militia officer, &quot;you won't catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its</span>
<span class="s0">rays!&quot; and she smiled amiably at Pierre. &quot;We were just talking of</span>
<span class="s0">you,&quot; she said with the facility in lying natural to a society</span>
<span class="s0">woman. &quot;We were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better</span>
<span class="s0">than Mamonov's.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, don't talk to me of my regiment,&quot; replied Pierre, kissing his</span>
<span class="s0">hostess' hand and taking a seat beside her. &quot;I am so sick of it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You will, of course, command it yourself?&quot; said Julie, directing</span>
<span class="s0">a sly, sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.</span>

<span class="s0">The latter in Pierre's presence had ceased to be caustic, and his</span>
<span class="s0">face expressed perplexity as to what Julie's smile might mean. In</span>
<span class="s0">spite of his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre's personality</span>
<span class="s0">immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I</span>
<span class="s0">should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Among those whom Julie's guests happened to choose to gossip about</span>
<span class="s0">were the Rostovs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,&quot; said Julie.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And he is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The</span>
<span class="s0">Razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it</span>
<span class="s0">drags on and on. He asks too much.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I think the sale will come off in a few days,&quot; said someone.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Julie. &quot;You don't think Moscow is in danger?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then why are you leaving?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is</span>
<span class="s0">going: and besides--I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off</span>
<span class="s0">all his debts,&quot; said the militia officer, speaking of Rostov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so</span>
<span class="s0">long in Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago.</span>
<span class="s0">Natalie is quite well again now, isn't she?&quot; Julie asked Pierre with a</span>
<span class="s0">knowing smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They are waiting for their younger son,&quot; Pierre replied. &quot;He joined</span>
<span class="s0">Obolenski's Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment</span>
<span class="s0">is being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my</span>
<span class="s0">regiment and are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave</span>
<span class="s0">long ago, but the countess won't on any account leave Moscow till</span>
<span class="s0">her son returns.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkharovs'. Natalie</span>
<span class="s0">has recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily</span>
<span class="s0">some people get over everything!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Get over what?&quot; inquired Pierre, looking displeased.</span>

<span class="s0">Julie smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de</span>
<span class="s0">Souza's novels.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What knights? What do you mean?&quot; demanded Pierre, blushing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, come, my dear count! C'est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous</span>
<span class="s0">admire, ma parole d'honneur!&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Forfeit, forfeit!&quot; cried the militia officer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right, one can't talk--how tiresome!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is 'the talk of all Moscow'?&quot; Pierre asked angrily, rising</span>
<span class="s0">to his feet.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come now, Count, you know!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know anything about it,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always</span>
<span class="s0">more friendly with Vera--that dear Vera.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, madame!&quot; Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, &quot;I have not</span>
<span class="s0">taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova's knight at all, and</span>
<span class="s0">have not been their house for nearly a month. But I cannot</span>
<span class="s0">understand the cruelty...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Qui s'excuse s'accuse,&quot;* said Julie, smiling and waving the lint</span>
<span class="s0">triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the</span>
<span class="s0">subject. &quot;Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkonskaya</span>
<span class="s0">arrived in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her</span>
<span class="s0">father?&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Who excuses himself, accuses himself.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their</span>
<span class="s0">estate near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, and how is she?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is</span>
<span class="s0">quite a romance. Nicholas Rostov! She was surrounded, and they</span>
<span class="s0">wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in</span>
<span class="s0">and saved her....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Another romance,&quot; said the militia officer. &quot;Really, this general</span>
<span class="s0">flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche</span>
<span class="s0">is one and Princess Bolkonskaya another.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du</span>
<span class="s0">jeune homme.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;A little bit in love with the young man.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But how could one say that in Russian?&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchin's</span>
<span class="s0">broadsheets that had been brought that day.</span>

<span class="s0">The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchin had</span>
<span class="s0">forbidden people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was</span>
<span class="s0">glad that ladies and tradesmen's wives were leaving the city. &quot;There</span>
<span class="s0">will be less panic and less gossip,&quot; ran the broadsheet &quot;but I will</span>
<span class="s0">stake my life on it that that will not enter Moscow.&quot; These words</span>
<span class="s0">showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would enter</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. The second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at</span>
<span class="s0">Vyazma, that Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as</span>
<span class="s0">many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were</span>
<span class="s0">ready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which</span>
<span class="s0">could be had at a low price. The tone of the proclamation was not as</span>
<span class="s0">jocose as in the former Chigirin talks. Pierre pondered over these</span>
<span class="s0">broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the</span>
<span class="s0">whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in</span>
<span class="s0">him was drawing near.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?&quot; he asked</span>
<span class="s0">himself for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on</span>
<span class="s0">the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If this patience comes out,&quot; he said to himself after shuffling the</span>
<span class="s0">cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, &quot;if it comes</span>
<span class="s0">out, it means... what does it mean?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of</span>
<span class="s0">the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then it will mean that I must go to the army,&quot; said Pierre to</span>
<span class="s0">himself. &quot;Come in, come in!&quot; he added to the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long</span>
<span class="s0">waist, was still living in Pierre's house. The two younger ones had</span>
<span class="s0">both married.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Excuse my coming to you, cousin,&quot; she said in a reproachful and</span>
<span class="s0">agitated voice. &quot;You know some decision must be come to. What is going</span>
<span class="s0">to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is</span>
<span class="s0">it that we are staying on?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,&quot; said Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling</span>
<span class="s0">uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivanovna told me</span>
<span class="s0">today how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly</span>
<span class="s0">does them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous--they no</span>
<span class="s0">longer obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they</span>
<span class="s0">will soon begin beating us. One can't walk in the streets. But,</span>
<span class="s0">above all, the French will be here any day now, so what are we waiting</span>
<span class="s0">for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,&quot; she went on, &quot;arrange for</span>
<span class="s0">me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can't live under</span>
<span class="s0">Bonaparte's rule.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On</span>
<span class="s0">the contrary...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I won't submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If</span>
<span class="s0">you don't want to do this...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I will, I'll give the order at once.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry</span>
<span class="s0">with. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you have been misinformed,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Everything is quiet</span>
<span class="s0">in the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I've just been</span>
<span class="s0">reading...&quot; He showed her the broadsheet. &quot;Count Rostopchin writes</span>
<span class="s0">that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, that count of yours!&quot; said the princess malevolently. &quot;He is</span>
<span class="s0">a hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot.</span>
<span class="s0">Didn't he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, 'whoever</span>
<span class="s0">it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'? (How</span>
<span class="s0">silly!) 'And honor and glory to whoever captures him,' he says. This</span>
<span class="s0">is what his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Ivanovna told me the</span>
<span class="s0">mob near killed her because she said something in French.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, but it's so... You take everything so to heart,&quot; said Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">and began laying out his cards for patience.</span>

<span class="s0">Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,</span>
<span class="s0">but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,</span>
<span class="s0">irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting</span>
<span class="s0">something terrible.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre's head</span>
<span class="s0">steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment</span>
<span class="s0">of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates.</span>
<span class="s0">In general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of</span>
<span class="s0">raising a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely</span>
<span class="s0">able to repress a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well then, sell it,&quot; said he. &quot;What's to be done? I can't draw back</span>
<span class="s0">now!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the</span>
<span class="s0">better was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the</span>
<span class="s0">catastrophe he expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was</span>
<span class="s0">left in town. Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his</span>
<span class="s0">intimate friends only the Rostovs remained, but he did not go to see</span>
<span class="s0">them.</span>

<span class="s0">To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of</span>
<span class="s0">Vorontsovo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to</span>
<span class="s0">destroy the foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The</span>
<span class="s0">balloon was not yet ready, but Pierre learned that it was being</span>
<span class="s0">constructed by the Emperor's desire. The Emperor had written to</span>
<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin as follows:</span>


<span class="s0">As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and</span>
<span class="s0">intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutuzov to</span>
<span class="s0">let him know. I have informed him of the matter.</span>

<span class="s0">Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for</span>
<span class="s0">the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy's hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with</span>
<span class="s0">those of the commander in chief.</span>


<span class="s0">On his way home from Vorontsovo, as he was passing the Bolotnoe</span>
<span class="s0">Place Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lobnoe Place, stopped and</span>
<span class="s0">got out of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being</span>
<span class="s0">flogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was</span>
<span class="s0">releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in</span>
<span class="s0">blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously.</span>
<span class="s0">Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their faces</span>
<span class="s0">they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering look</span>
<span class="s0">resembling that on the thin Frenchman's face, Pierre pushed his way in</span>
<span class="s0">through the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it? Who is it? What is it for?&quot; he kept asking.</span>

<span class="s0">But the attention of the crowd--officials, burghers, shopkeepers,</span>
<span class="s0">peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses--was so eagerly centered</span>
<span class="s0">on what was passing in Lobnoe Place that no one answered him. The</span>
<span class="s0">stout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently</span>
<span class="s0">trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking</span>
<span class="s0">about him, but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in</span>
<span class="s0">the way full-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for</span>
<span class="s0">doing so. In the crowd people began talking loudly, to stifle their</span>
<span class="s0">feelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's cook to some prince.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets</span>
<span class="s0">his teeth on edge!&quot; said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, when the Frenchman began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be</span>
<span class="s0">appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch</span>
<span class="s0">in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went</span>
<span class="s0">back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took</span>
<span class="s0">his seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times</span>
<span class="s0">so audibly that the coachman asked him:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is your pleasure?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to</span>
<span class="s0">Lubyanka Street.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To the Governor's, as you ordered,&quot; answered the coachman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fool! Idiot!&quot; shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman--a thing he</span>
<span class="s0">rarely did. &quot;Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!&quot; &quot;I must</span>
<span class="s0">get away this very day,&quot; he murmured to himself.</span>

<span class="s0">At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the</span>
<span class="s0">Lobnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he</span>
<span class="s0">could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that</span>
<span class="s0">very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman</span>
<span class="s0">this or that the man ought to have known it for himself.</span>

<span class="s0">On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey--his head coachman</span>
<span class="s0">who knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow-</span>
<span class="s0">that he would leave that night for the army at Mozhaysk, and that</span>
<span class="s0">his saddle horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged</span>
<span class="s0">that day, so on Evstafey's representation Pierre had to put off his</span>
<span class="s0">departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be</span>
<span class="s0">sent on in advance.</span>

<span class="s0">On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain,</span>
<span class="s0">and after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night</span>
<span class="s0">in Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that</span>
<span class="s0">evening. (This was the battle of Shevardino.) He was told that there</span>
<span class="s0">in Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could</span>
<span class="s0">answer his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was</span>
<span class="s0">approaching Mozhaysk.</span>

<span class="s0">Every house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the</span>
<span class="s0">hostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no</span>
<span class="s0">room to be had. It was full of officers.</span>

<span class="s0">Everywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on</span>
<span class="s0">the march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and</span>
<span class="s0">cannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and</span>
<span class="s0">the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into</span>
<span class="s0">that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation</span>
<span class="s0">and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a</span>
<span class="s0">feeling akin to what he had felt at the Sloboda Palace during the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor's visit--a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and</span>
<span class="s0">sacrificing something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that</span>
<span class="s0">everything that constitutes men's happiness--the comforts of life,</span>
<span class="s0">wealth, even life itself--is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away,</span>
<span class="s0">compared with something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did</span>
<span class="s0">not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular</span>
<span class="s0">delight in sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the</span>
<span class="s0">question of what to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself</span>
<span class="s0">afforded him a new and joyous sensation.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevardino</span>
<span class="s0">Redoubt was fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either</span>
<span class="s0">side, and on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodino itself took</span>
<span class="s0">place.</span>

<span class="s0">Why and how were the battles of Shevardino and Borodino given and</span>
<span class="s0">accepted? Why was the battle of Borodino fought? There was not the</span>
<span class="s0">least sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate</span>
<span class="s0">result for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought</span>
<span class="s0">nearer to the destruction of Moscow--which we feared more than</span>
<span class="s0">anything in the world; and for the French its immediate result was</span>
<span class="s0">that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole</span>
<span class="s0">army--which they feared more than anything in the world. What the</span>
<span class="s0">result must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">accepted that battle.</span>

<span class="s0">If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it</span>
<span class="s0">must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen</span>
<span class="s0">hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter</span>
<span class="s0">of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have</span>
<span class="s0">been equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the</span>
<span class="s0">loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov this was mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing</span>
<span class="s0">draughts I have one man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly</span>
<span class="s0">lose, and therefore should not exchange. When my opponent has</span>
<span class="s0">sixteen men and I have fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than</span>
<span class="s0">he, but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times</span>
<span class="s0">as strong as I am.</span>

<span class="s0">Before the battle of Borodino our strength in proportion to the</span>
<span class="s0">French was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little</span>
<span class="s0">more than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a</span>
<span class="s0">hundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty</span>
<span class="s0">thousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a</span>
<span class="s0">commander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of his army and</span>
<span class="s0">lengthening his lines of communication still more. If it is said</span>
<span class="s0">that he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow as he had</span>
<span class="s0">ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much</span>
<span class="s0">evidence to the contrary. Napoleon's historians themselves tell us</span>
<span class="s0">that from Smolensk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his</span>
<span class="s0">extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be</span>
<span class="s0">the end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smolensk the state in</span>
<span class="s0">which Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single</span>
<span class="s0">reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.</span>

<span class="s0">In giving and accepting battle at Borodino, Kutuzov acted</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had</span>
<span class="s0">occurred, the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the</span>
<span class="s0">foresight and genius the generals who, of all the blind tools of</span>
<span class="s0">history were the most enslaved and involuntary.</span>

<span class="s0">The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes</span>
<span class="s0">furnish the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to</span>
<span class="s0">accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that</span>
<span class="s0">kind are meaningless.</span>

<span class="s0">On the other question, how the battle of Borodino and the</span>
<span class="s0">preceding battle of Shevardino were fought, there also exists a</span>
<span class="s0">definite and well-known, but quite false, conception. All the</span>
<span class="s0">historians describe the affair as follows:</span>

<span class="s0">The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolensk sought</span>
<span class="s0">out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found</span>
<span class="s0">such a position at Borodino.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the</span>
<span class="s0">left of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolensk) and almost at a right</span>
<span class="s0">angle to it, from Borodino to Utitsa, at the very place where the</span>
<span class="s0">battle was fought.</span>

<span class="s0">In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set</span>
<span class="s0">up on the Shevardino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth,</span>
<span class="s0">we are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on</span>
<span class="s0">the twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in</span>
<span class="s0">position on the field of Borodino.</span>

<span class="s0">So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares</span>
<span class="s0">to look into the matter can easily convince himself.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the</span>
<span class="s0">contrary, during the retreat passed many positions better than</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino. They did not stop at any one of these positions because</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen,</span>
<span class="s0">because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself</span>
<span class="s0">strongly enough, and because Miloradovich had not yet arrived with the</span>
<span class="s0">militia, and for many other reasons. The fact is that other</span>
<span class="s0">positions they had passed were stronger, and that the position at</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino (the one where the battle was fought), far from being strong,</span>
<span class="s0">was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.</span>

<span class="s0">Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that</span>
<span class="s0">is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be</span>
<span class="s0">fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no</span>
<span class="s0">entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the</span>
<span class="s0">position of the Shevardino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless</span>
<span class="s0">in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it</span>
<span class="s0">more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all</span>
<span class="s0">efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till</span>
<span class="s0">late at night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have</span>
<span class="s0">sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position</span>
<span class="s0">on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the</span>
<span class="s0">Shevardino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we</span>
<span class="s0">have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and</span>
<span class="s0">Bagration were convinced that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left</span>
<span class="s0">flank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself in his report, written</span>
<span class="s0">in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevardino Redoubt as the</span>
<span class="s0">left flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on the</span>
<span class="s0">battle of Borodino were written at leisure, that the incorrect and</span>
<span class="s0">extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes</span>
<span class="s0">of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible)</span>
<span class="s0">that the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post--whereas in reality</span>
<span class="s0">it was simply a fortified point on the left flank--and that the battle</span>
<span class="s0">of Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously</span>
<span class="s0">selected, where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which</span>
<span class="s0">was almost unentrenched.</span>

<span class="s0">The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river</span>
<span class="s0">Kolocha--which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an</span>
<span class="s0">acute angle--so that the left flank was at Shevardino, the right flank</span>
<span class="s0">near the village of Novoe, and the center at Borodino at the</span>
<span class="s0">confluence of the rivers Kolocha and Voyna.</span>

<span class="s0">To anyone who looks at the field of Borodino without thinking of how</span>
<span class="s0">the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the</span>
<span class="s0">river Kolocha, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was</span>
<span class="s0">to prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolensk road to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon, riding to Valuevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as</span>
<span class="s0">the history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utitsa</span>
<span class="s0">to Borodino (he could not have seen that position because it did not</span>
<span class="s0">exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while</span>
<span class="s0">pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian position--at the Shevardino Redoubt--and unexpectedly for</span>
<span class="s0">the Russians moved his army across the Kolocha. And the Russians,</span>
<span class="s0">not having time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left</span>
<span class="s0">wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new</span>
<span class="s0">position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By</span>
<span class="s0">crossing to the other side of the Kolocha to the left of the highroad,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left</span>
<span class="s0">(looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the plain</span>
<span class="s0">between Utitsa, Semenovsk, and Borodino--a plain no more</span>
<span class="s0">advantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia--and there</span>
<span class="s0">the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place.</span>

<span class="s0">Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to</span>
<span class="s0">the Kolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the</span>
<span class="s0">redoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have</span>
<span class="s0">doubted that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of our and</span>
<span class="s0">the battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case</span>
<span class="s0">we should probably have defended the Shevardino Redoubt--our left</span>
<span class="s0">flank--still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the</span>
<span class="s0">center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on</span>
<span class="s0">the twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But</span>
<span class="s0">as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the</span>
<span class="s0">retreat of our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at</span>
<span class="s0">Gridneva), and as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not</span>
<span class="s0">in time, to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-fourth, the first and chief action of the battle of Borodino</span>
<span class="s0">was already lost on the twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss</span>
<span class="s0">of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.</span>

<span class="s0">After the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found ourselves on</span>
<span class="s0">the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank,</span>
<span class="s0">and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it</span>
<span class="s0">chanced to be.</span>

<span class="s0">Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by</span>
<span class="s0">weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that</span>
<span class="s0">position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders--not</span>
<span class="s0">having fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of our</span>
<span class="s0">position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of</span>
<span class="s0">the forthcoming battle from right to left--maintained their extended</span>
<span class="s0">position from the village of Novoe to Utitsa, and consequently had</span>
<span class="s0">to move their forces from right to left during the battle. So it</span>
<span class="s0">happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the</span>
<span class="s0">entire French army launched against our left flank with but half as</span>
<span class="s0">many men. (Poniatowski's action against Utitsa, and Uvarov's on the</span>
<span class="s0">right flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main</span>
<span class="s0">course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodino did not take place at</span>
<span class="s0">all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders' mistakes even at the</span>
<span class="s0">cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it</span>
<span class="s0">has been described. The battle of Borodino was not fought on a</span>
<span class="s0">chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than</span>
<span class="s0">those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shevardino</span>
<span class="s0">Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodino on an open and</span>
<span class="s0">almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the</span>
<span class="s0">French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely</span>
<span class="s0">unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result,</span>
<span class="s0">but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration</span>
<span class="s0">and flight.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XX</span>


<span class="s0">On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozhaysk. At</span>
<span class="s0">the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led</span>
<span class="s0">out of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was</span>
<span class="s0">being held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle</span>
<span class="s0">and proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down</span>
<span class="s0">the hill preceded by its singers. Coming up toward him was a train</span>
<span class="s0">of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day</span>
<span class="s0">before. The peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept</span>
<span class="s0">crossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which three or</span>
<span class="s0">four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted over the stones</span>
<span class="s0">that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like</span>
<span class="s0">a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks,</span>
<span class="s0">compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the</span>
<span class="s0">carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost all of them</span>
<span class="s0">stared with naive, childlike curiosity at Pierre's white hat and green</span>
<span class="s0">swallow-tail coat.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep</span>
<span class="s0">to one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the</span>
<span class="s0">hill with its singers, surrounded Pierre's carriage and blocked the</span>
<span class="s0">road. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in</span>
<span class="s0">which the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not</span>
<span class="s0">penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded</span>
<span class="s0">merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road</span>
<span class="s0">close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it,</span>
<span class="s0">placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began</span>
<span class="s0">arranging the breech-band on his little horse.</span>

<span class="s0">One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was</span>
<span class="s0">following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand</span>
<span class="s0">and turned to look at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us</span>
<span class="s0">on to Moscow?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question.</span>
<span class="s0">He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy</span>
<span class="s0">of wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two</span>
<span class="s0">wounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in</span>
<span class="s0">the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was</span>
<span class="s0">wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby's</span>
<span class="s0">head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was</span>
<span class="s0">looking at the cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a</span>
<span class="s0">fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his</span>
<span class="s0">thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third</span>
<span class="s0">lay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry singers were</span>
<span class="s0">passing close by:</span>

   <span class="s0">Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,</span>
   <span class="s0">Living in a foreign land.</span>

<span class="s0">they sang their soldiers' dance song.</span>

<span class="s0">As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the</span>
<span class="s0">metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays</span>
<span class="s0">of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another</span>
<span class="s0">sort of merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded</span>
<span class="s0">near the panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber,</span>
<span class="s0">and sad.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry</span>
<span class="s0">singers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, the coxcombs!&quot; he muttered reproachfully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's not the soldiers only, but I've seen peasants today, too....</span>
<span class="s0">The peasants--even they have to go,&quot; said the soldier behind the cart,</span>
<span class="s0">addressing Pierre with a sad smile. &quot;No distinctions made nowadays....</span>
<span class="s0">They want the whole nation to fall on them--in a word, it's Moscow!</span>
<span class="s0">They want to make an end of it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In spite of the obscurity of the soldier's words Pierre understood</span>
<span class="s0">what he wanted to say and nodded approval.</span>

<span class="s0">The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.</span>

<span class="s0">He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but</span>
<span class="s0">only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of</span>
<span class="s0">different branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at</span>
<span class="s0">his white hat and green tail coat.</span>

<span class="s0">Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and</span>
<span class="s0">eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was</span>
<span class="s0">driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young</span>
<span class="s0">surgeon, and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied</span>
<span class="s0">the driver's seat to pull up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?&quot; asked the doctor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you know, I wanted to see...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, there will be something to see....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of</span>
<span class="s0">taking part in a battle.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he said, exchanging glances with his young companion. &quot;Anyhow his</span>
<span class="s0">Serene Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That's what</span>
<span class="s0">you must do.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is</span>
<span class="s0">exactly?&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The position?&quot; repeated the doctor. &quot;Well, that's not my line.</span>
<span class="s0">Drive past Tatarinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the</span>
<span class="s0">hillock and you'll see.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Can one see from there?... If you would...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I would go with you but on my honor I'm up to here&quot;--and he pointed</span>
<span class="s0">to his throat. &quot;I'm galloping to the commander of the corps. How do</span>
<span class="s0">matters stand?... You know, Count, there'll be a battle tomorrow.</span>
<span class="s0">Out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty</span>
<span class="s0">thousand wounded, and we haven't stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or</span>
<span class="s0">doctors enough for six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we</span>
<span class="s0">need other things as well--we must manage as best we can!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who</span>
<span class="s0">had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had</span>
<span class="s0">noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death</span>
<span class="s0">amazed Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but</span>
<span class="s0">death?&quot; And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the</span>
<span class="s0">Mozhaysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the</span>
<span class="s0">slanting rays of the sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly</span>
<span class="s0">recurred to his mind.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a</span>
<span class="s0">moment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded.</span>
<span class="s0">Yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they</span>
<span class="s0">wonder at my hat! Strange!&quot; thought Pierre, continuing his way to</span>
<span class="s0">Tatarinova.</span>

<span class="s0">In front of a landowner's house to the left of the road stood</span>
<span class="s0">carriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief was putting up there, but just when Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there--they had</span>
<span class="s0">gone to the church service. Pierre drove on toward Gorki.</span>

<span class="s0">When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street,</span>
<span class="s0">he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and</span>
<span class="s0">with crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated</span>
<span class="s0">and perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to</span>
<span class="s0">the right of the road.</span>

<span class="s0">Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth</span>
<span class="s0">along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.</span>

<span class="s0">Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On</span>
<span class="s0">seeing these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the</span>
<span class="s0">novelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded men at Mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when</span>
<span class="s0">he said: &quot;They want the whole nation to fall on them.&quot; The sight of</span>
<span class="s0">these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer,</span>
<span class="s0">clumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the</span>
<span class="s0">left toward the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned</span>
<span class="s0">collarbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and</span>
<span class="s0">importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXI</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling</span>
<span class="s0">militiamen, ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor,</span>
<span class="s0">the battlefield could be seen.</span>

<span class="s0">It was about eleven o'clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left</span>
<span class="s0">and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising</span>
<span class="s0">like an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied</span>
<span class="s0">atmosphere.</span>

<span class="s0">From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk highroad, passing through a village with a white church</span>
<span class="s0">some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino. Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge</span>
<span class="s0">and, winding down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of</span>
<span class="s0">Valuevo visible about four miles away, where Napoleon was then</span>
<span class="s0">stationed. Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest</span>
<span class="s0">on the horizon. Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to</span>
<span class="s0">the right of the road, the cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery</span>
<span class="s0">gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue</span>
<span class="s0">expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking</span>
<span class="s0">campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops--ours and</span>
<span class="s0">the enemy's. The ground to the right--along the course of the</span>
<span class="s0">Kolocha and Moskva rivers--was broken and hilly. Between the hollows</span>
<span class="s0">the villages of Bezubova and Zakharino showed in the distance. On</span>
<span class="s0">the left the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and</span>
<span class="s0">the smoking ruins of Semenovsk, which had been burned down, could be</span>
<span class="s0">seen.</span>

<span class="s0">All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor</span>
<span class="s0">the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations.</span>
<span class="s0">Nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only</span>
<span class="s0">fields, meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages,</span>
<span class="s0">mounds, and streams; and try as he would he could descry no military</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;position&quot; in this place which teemed with life, nor could he even</span>
<span class="s0">distinguish our troops from the enemy's.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I must ask someone who knows,&quot; he thought, and addressed an officer</span>
<span class="s0">who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May I ask you,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;what village that is in front?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Burdino, isn't it?&quot; said the officer, turning to his companion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Borodino,&quot; the other corrected him.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up</span>
<span class="s0">to Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are those our men there?&quot; Pierre inquired.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and there, further on, are the French,&quot; said the officer.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;There they are, there... you can see them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where? Where?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left</span>
<span class="s0">beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, those are the French! And over there?...&quot; Pierre pointed to a</span>
<span class="s0">knoll on the left, near which some troops could be seen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Those are ours.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, ours! And there?...&quot; Pierre pointed to another knoll in the</span>
<span class="s0">distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow</span>
<span class="s0">where also some campfires were smoking and something black was</span>
<span class="s0">visible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's his again,&quot; said the officer. (It was the Shevardino</span>
<span class="s0">Redoubt.) &quot;It was ours yesterday, but now it is his.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then how about our position?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Our position?&quot; replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our</span>
<span class="s0">entrenchments. There, you see? There's our center, at Borodino, just</span>
<span class="s0">there,&quot; and he pointed to the village in front of them with the</span>
<span class="s0">white church. &quot;That's where one crosses the Kolocha. You see down</span>
<span class="s0">there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there's the</span>
<span class="s0">bridge. That's our center. Our right flank is over there&quot;--he</span>
<span class="s0">pointed sharply to the right, far away in the broken ground--&quot;That's</span>
<span class="s0">where the Moskva River is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there,</span>
<span class="s0">very strong ones. The left flank...&quot; here the officer paused. &quot;Well,</span>
<span class="s0">you see, that's difficult to explain.... Yesterday our left flank</span>
<span class="s0">was there at Shevardino, you see, where the oak is, but now we have</span>
<span class="s0">withdrawn our left wing--now it is over there, do you see that village</span>
<span class="s0">and the smoke? That's Semenovsk, yes, there,&quot; he pointed to</span>
<span class="s0">Raevski's knoll. &quot;But the battle will hardly be there. His having</span>
<span class="s0">moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will probably pass round</span>
<span class="s0">to the right of the Moskva. But wherever it may be, many a man will be</span>
<span class="s0">missing tomorrow!&quot; he remarked.</span>

<span class="s0">An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was</span>
<span class="s0">giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish</span>
<span class="s0">speaking, but at this point, evidently not liking the officer's</span>
<span class="s0">remark, interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Gabions must be sent for,&quot; said he sternly.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might</span>
<span class="s0">think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak</span>
<span class="s0">to speak of it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, send number three company again,&quot; the officer replied</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And you, are you one of the doctors?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I've come on my own,&quot; answered Pierre, and he went down the</span>
<span class="s0">hill again, passing the militiamen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, those damned fellows!&quot; muttered the officer who followed him,</span>
<span class="s0">holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They'll</span>
<span class="s0">be here in a minute...&quot; voices were suddenly heard saying; and</span>
<span class="s0">officers, soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the</span>
<span class="s0">road.</span>

<span class="s0">A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodino. First</span>
<span class="s0">along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with</span>
<span class="s0">arms reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.</span>

<span class="s0">Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the</span>
<span class="s0">procession.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of</span>
<span class="s0">God!&quot; someone cried.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Smolensk Mother of God,&quot; another corrected him.</span>

<span class="s0">The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who</span>
<span class="s0">had been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to</span>
<span class="s0">meet the church procession. Following the battalion that marched along</span>
<span class="s0">the dusty road came priests in their vestments--one little old man</span>
<span class="s0">in a hood with attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and</span>
<span class="s0">officers bore a large, dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover.</span>
<span class="s0">This was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied</span>
<span class="s0">the army. Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with</span>
<span class="s0">bared heads walked, ran, and bowed to the ground.</span>

<span class="s0">At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who</span>
<span class="s0">had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved</span>
<span class="s0">by others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The</span>
<span class="s0">hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind</span>
<span class="s0">played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons</span>
<span class="s0">decorating the icon. The singing did not sound loud under the open</span>
<span class="s0">sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and a chanter stood the</span>
<span class="s0">notabilities on a spot reserved for them. A bald general with</span>
<span class="s0">general with a St. George's Cross on his neck stood just behind the</span>
<span class="s0">priest's back, and without crossing himself (he was evidently a</span>
<span class="s0">German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which he</span>
<span class="s0">considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the</span>
<span class="s0">patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial</span>
<span class="s0">pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while</span>
<span class="s0">looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not</span>
<span class="s0">look at them--his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious</span>
<span class="s0">expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who</span>
<span class="s0">were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters,</span>
<span class="s0">who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began</span>
<span class="s0">lazily and mechanically to sing: &quot;Save from calamity Thy servants, O</span>
<span class="s0">Mother of God,&quot; and the priest and deacon chimed in: &quot;For to Thee</span>
<span class="s0">under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre had</span>
<span class="s0">seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozhaysk and</span>
<span class="s0">momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and</span>
<span class="s0">heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and</span>
<span class="s0">the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.</span>

<span class="s0">The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.</span>
<span class="s0">Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which</span>
<span class="s0">way was made for him, was approaching the icon.</span>

<span class="s0">It was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the position and on his</span>
<span class="s0">way back to Tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which</span>
<span class="s0">distinguished him from everybody else.</span>

<span class="s0">With a long overcoat on his his exceedingly stout,</span>
<span class="s0">round-shouldered body, with uncovered white head and puffy face</span>
<span class="s0">showing the white ball of the eye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with</span>
<span class="s0">plunging, swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest.</span>
<span class="s0">He crossed himself with an accustomed movement, bent till he touched</span>
<span class="s0">the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh.</span>
<span class="s0">Behind Kutuzov was Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the presence of</span>
<span class="s0">the commander in chief, who attracted the attention of all the</span>
<span class="s0">superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers</span>
<span class="s0">without looking at him.</span>

<span class="s0">When the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, sank</span>
<span class="s0">heavily to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried</span>
<span class="s0">vainly to rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and</span>
<span class="s0">weight. His white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose,</span>
<span class="s0">kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips, and again</span>
<span class="s0">bowed till he touched the ground with his hand. The other generals</span>
<span class="s0">followed his example, then the officers, and after them with excited</span>
<span class="s0">faces, pressing on one another, crowding, panting, and pushing,</span>
<span class="s0">scrambled the soldiers and militiamen.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXII</span>


<span class="s0">Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?&quot; said a voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees with his</span>
<span class="s0">hand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the</span>
<span class="s0">icon), came up to him smiling. Boris was elegantly dressed, with a</span>
<span class="s0">slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long</span>
<span class="s0">coat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.</span>

<span class="s0">Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in</span>
<span class="s0">the shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run</span>
<span class="s0">to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant suite surrounded him.</span>

<span class="s0">The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">stopped some thirty paces from Kutuzov, talking to Boris.</span>

<span class="s0">He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the</span>
<span class="s0">position.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is what you must do,&quot; said Boris. &quot;I will do the honors of the</span>
<span class="s0">camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen</span>
<span class="s0">will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I'll mention it to</span>
<span class="s0">him. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us.</span>
<span class="s0">We are just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend</span>
<span class="s0">the night with me and we'll arrange a game of cards. Of course you</span>
<span class="s0">know Dmitri Sergeevich? Those are his quarters,&quot; and he pointed to the</span>
<span class="s0">third house in the village of Gorki.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I should like to see the right flank. They say it's very</span>
<span class="s0">strong,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I should like to start from the Moskva River</span>
<span class="s0">and ride round the whole position.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left</span>
<span class="s0">flank.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski's regiment? Can you point</span>
<span class="s0">it out to me?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Prince Andrew's? We shall pass it and I'll take you to him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What about the left flank?&quot; asked Pierre</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state</span>
<span class="s0">our left flank is in,&quot; said Boris confidentially lowering his voice.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify</span>
<span class="s0">that knoll quite differently, but...&quot; Boris shrugged his shoulders,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;his Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him.</span>
<span class="s0">You see...&quot; but Boris did not finish, for at that moment Kaysarov,</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov's adjutant, came up to Pierre. &quot;Ah, Kaysarov!&quot; said Boris,</span>
<span class="s0">addressing him with an unembarrassed smile, &quot;I was just trying to</span>
<span class="s0">explain our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene</span>
<span class="s0">Highness could so the intentions of the French!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You mean the left flank?&quot; asked Kaysarov.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Though Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff,</span>
<span class="s0">Boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He</span>
<span class="s0">had established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom</span>
<span class="s0">Boris had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskoy an</span>
<span class="s0">invaluable man.</span>

<span class="s0">In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties:</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov's party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris</span>
<span class="s0">belonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile</span>
<span class="s0">respect to Kutuzov, could so create an impression that the old</span>
<span class="s0">fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now</span>
<span class="s0">the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed</span>
<span class="s0">and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov won the battle</span>
<span class="s0">it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case</span>
<span class="s0">many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow's action, and</span>
<span class="s0">new men would come to the front. So Boris was full of nervous vivacity</span>
<span class="s0">all day.</span>

<span class="s0">After Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had</span>
<span class="s0">not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered</span>
<span class="s0">upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all</span>
<span class="s0">expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the</span>
<span class="s0">cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in</span>
<span class="s0">questions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by</span>
<span class="s0">the different expression he saw on other faces--an expression that</span>
<span class="s0">spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life</span>
<span class="s0">and death. Kutuzov noticed Pierre's figure and the group gathered</span>
<span class="s0">round him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Call him to me,&quot; said Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness' wish, and Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">went toward Kutuzov's bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It</span>
<span class="s0">was Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How did that fellow get here?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!&quot; was the answer. &quot;He has</span>
<span class="s0">been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He's been</span>
<span class="s0">proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy's picket</span>
<span class="s0">line at night.... He's a brave fellow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might</span>
<span class="s0">send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I</span>
<span class="s0">shouldn't lose anything...&quot; Dolokhov was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my</span>
<span class="s0">Fatherland for which I am ready to die.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare</span>
<span class="s0">his skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your</span>
<span class="s0">Serene Highness.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes... Yes...&quot; Kutuzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more</span>
<span class="s0">and more as he looked at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Just then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner, without</span>
<span class="s0">raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted</span>
<span class="s0">conversation:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What</span>
<span class="s0">heroism, Count!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by</span>
<span class="s0">his Serene Highness. He knew Kutuzov's attention would be caught by</span>
<span class="s0">those words, and so it was.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you saying about the militia?&quot; he asked Boris.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness--for death--they</span>
<span class="s0">have put on clean shirts.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!&quot; said Kutuzov; and he closed</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes and swayed his head. &quot;A matchless people!&quot; he repeated with a</span>
<span class="s0">sigh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you want to smell gunpowder?&quot; he said to Pierre. &quot;Yes, it's a</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife's adorers.</span>
<span class="s0">Is she well? My quarters are at your service.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began looking about</span>
<span class="s0">absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.</span>

<span class="s0">Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">Kaysarov, his adjutant's brother.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Those verses... those verses of Marin's... how do they go, eh?</span>
<span class="s0">Those he wrote about Gerakov: 'Lectures for the corps inditing'...</span>
<span class="s0">Recite them, recite them!&quot; said he, evidently preparing to laugh.</span>

<span class="s0">Kaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm</span>
<span class="s0">of the verses.</span>

<span class="s0">When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and took his</span>
<span class="s0">hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am very glad to meet you here, Count,&quot; he said aloud,</span>
<span class="s0">regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute</span>
<span class="s0">and solemn tone. &quot;On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us</span>
<span class="s0">is fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that</span>
<span class="s0">I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should</span>
<span class="s0">wish you not to have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to</span>
<span class="s0">him. With tears in his eyes Dolokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.</span>

<span class="s0">Boris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It will interest you,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, very much,&quot; replied Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Half an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova, and Bennigsen and</span>
<span class="s0">his suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the</span>
<span class="s0">line.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIII</span>


<span class="s0">From Gorki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which,</span>
<span class="s0">when they had looked it from the hill, the officer had pointed out</span>
<span class="s0">as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant</span>
<span class="s0">new-mown hay lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into</span>
<span class="s0">the village of Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an</span>
<span class="s0">enormous number of troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where</span>
<span class="s0">militiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which</span>
<span class="s0">afterwards became known as the Raevski Redoubt, or the Knoll</span>
<span class="s0">Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it. He did not know</span>
<span class="s0">that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on</span>
<span class="s0">the plain of Borodino.</span>

<span class="s0">They then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, where the soldiers were</span>
<span class="s0">dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode</span>
<span class="s0">downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if</span>
<span class="s0">by hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the</span>
<span class="s0">furrows of the plowed land, and reached some fleches* which were still</span>
<span class="s0">being dug.</span>


<span class="s0">*A kind of entrenchment.</span>


<span class="s0">At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevardino</span>
<span class="s0">Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several</span>
<span class="s0">horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">or Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of</span>
<span class="s0">horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the</span>
<span class="s0">scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men</span>
<span class="s0">rode away from the mound and disappeared.</span>

<span class="s0">Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began</span>
<span class="s0">explaining the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him,</span>
<span class="s0">straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the</span>
<span class="s0">impending battle, but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity</span>
<span class="s0">was inadequate for the task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen</span>
<span class="s0">stopped speaking and, noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">said to him:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't think this interests you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary it's very interesting!&quot; replied Pierre not quite</span>
<span class="s0">truthfully.</span>

<span class="s0">From the fleches they rode still farther to the left, along a road</span>
<span class="s0">winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of</span>
<span class="s0">the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the</span>
<span class="s0">tramp of the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the</span>
<span class="s0">road in front of them for some time, arousing general attention and</span>
<span class="s0">laughter, and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to</span>
<span class="s0">one side and disappear in the thicket. After going through the wood</span>
<span class="s0">for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of</span>
<span class="s0">Tuchkov's corps were stationed to defend the left flank.</span>

<span class="s0">Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and</span>
<span class="s0">with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great</span>
<span class="s0">military importance. In front of Tuchkov's troops was some high ground</span>
<span class="s0">not occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake,</span>
<span class="s0">saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the</span>
<span class="s0">country around unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the</span>
<span class="s0">generals expressed the same opinion. One in particular declared with</span>
<span class="s0">martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen</span>
<span class="s0">on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground.</span>
<span class="s0">This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre's doubt of his own</span>
<span class="s0">capacity to understand military matters. Listening to Bennigsen and</span>
<span class="s0">the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill,</span>
<span class="s0">he quite understood them and shared their opinion, but for that very</span>
<span class="s0">reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind</span>
<span class="s0">the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen</span>
<span class="s0">supposed, put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed</span>
<span class="s0">position as an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be</span>
<span class="s0">able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not</span>
<span class="s0">know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas</span>
<span class="s0">without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIV</span>


<span class="s0">On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on</span>
<span class="s0">his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkovo at the</span>
<span class="s0">further end of his regiment's encampment. Through a gap in the</span>
<span class="s0">broken wall he could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty</span>
<span class="s0">year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off, a field on</span>
<span class="s0">which shocks of oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose</span>
<span class="s0">the smoke of campfires--the soldiers' kitchens.</span>

<span class="s0">Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable</span>
<span class="s0">as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.</span>

<span class="s0">He had received and given the orders for next day's battle and had</span>
<span class="s0">nothing more to do. But his thoughts--the simplest, clearest, and</span>
<span class="s0">therefore most terrible thoughts--would give him no peace. He knew</span>
<span class="s0">that tomorrow's battle would be the most terrible of all he had</span>
<span class="s0">taken part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">death presented itself to him--not in relation to any worldly matter</span>
<span class="s0">or with reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to</span>
<span class="s0">himself, to his own soul--vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as</span>
<span class="s0">a certainty. And from the height of this perception all that had</span>
<span class="s0">previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined</span>
<span class="s0">by a cold white light without shadows, without perspective, without</span>
<span class="s0">distinction of outline. All life appeared to him like magic-lantern</span>
<span class="s0">pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light</span>
<span class="s0">through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in</span>
<span class="s0">clear daylight and without a glass. &quot;Yes, yes! There they are, those</span>
<span class="s0">false images that agitated, enraptured, and tormented me,&quot; said he</span>
<span class="s0">to himself, passing in review the principal pictures of the magic</span>
<span class="s0">lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of</span>
<span class="s0">his clear perception of death. &quot;There they are, those rudely painted</span>
<span class="s0">figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of</span>
<span class="s0">society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself--how important these</span>
<span class="s0">pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold</span>
<span class="s0">white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.&quot; The three</span>
<span class="s0">great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his love</span>
<span class="s0">for a woman, his father's death, and the French invasion which had</span>
<span class="s0">overrun half Russia. &quot;Love... that little girl who seemed to me</span>
<span class="s0">brimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made</span>
<span class="s0">romantic plans of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I</span>
<span class="s0">was!&quot; he said aloud bitterly. &quot;Ah me! I believed in some ideal love</span>
<span class="s0">which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence!</span>
<span class="s0">Like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me....</span>
<span class="s0">But it was much simpler really.... It was all very simple and</span>
<span class="s0">horrible.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his</span>
<span class="s0">land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,</span>
<span class="s0">unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his</span>
<span class="s0">path, and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary says it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when</span>
<span class="s0">he is not here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is</span>
<span class="s0">the trial intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one</span>
<span class="s0">of our own men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as</span>
<span class="s0">one of them did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by</span>
<span class="s0">head and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under</span>
<span class="s0">their noses, and new conditions of life will arise, which will seem</span>
<span class="s0">quite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall</span>
<span class="s0">not exist...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with</span>
<span class="s0">their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. &quot;To die...</span>
<span class="s0">to be killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this</span>
<span class="s0">should still be, but no me....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the</span>
<span class="s0">smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed</span>
<span class="s0">terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose</span>
<span class="s0">quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.</span>

<span class="s0">After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. &quot;Who's</span>
<span class="s0">that?&quot; he cried.</span>

<span class="s0">The red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly Dolokhov's squadron</span>
<span class="s0">commander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander,</span>

<span class="s0">shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental</span>
<span class="s0">paymaster.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come</span>
<span class="s0">about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss</span>
<span class="s0">them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Devil take it!&quot; said the voice of a man stumbling over something.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped</span>
<span class="s0">over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It</span>
<span class="s0">was unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in</span>
<span class="s0">general, and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful</span>
<span class="s0">moments of his last visit to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You? What a surprise!&quot; said he. &quot;What brings you here? This is</span>
<span class="s0">unexpected!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness--they</span>
<span class="s0">expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached</span>
<span class="s0">the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew's face he felt</span>
<span class="s0">constrained and ill at ease.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;interesting.&quot; &quot;I wish to see the battle.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would</span>
<span class="s0">they stop it?&quot; said Prince Andrew sarcastically. &quot;Well, and how's</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow? And my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?&quot; he asked</span>
<span class="s0">seriously.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me so. I went to see them,</span>
<span class="s0">but missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXV</span>


<span class="s0">The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently</span>
<span class="s0">reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and</span>
<span class="s0">have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed</span>
<span class="s0">with surprise at Pierre's huge stout figure and listened to his talk</span>
<span class="s0">of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden.</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding</span>
<span class="s0">that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured</span>
<span class="s0">battalion commander.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you understand the whole position of our troops?&quot; Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes--that is, how do you mean?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Not being a</span>
<span class="s0">military man I can't say I have understood it fully, but I</span>
<span class="s0">understand the general position.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew. &quot;Well, and what do think of Kutuzov's appointment?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was very glad of his appointment, that's all I know,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are</span>
<span class="s0">saying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ask them,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked at Timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative</span>
<span class="s0">smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your</span>
<span class="s0">excellency,&quot; said Timokhin timidly, and continually turning to</span>
<span class="s0">glance at his colonel.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why so?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you.</span>
<span class="s0">Why, when we were retreating from Sventsyani we dare not touch a stick</span>
<span class="s0">or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would</span>
<span class="s0">get it all; wasn't it so, your excellency?&quot; and again Timokhin</span>
<span class="s0">turned to the prince. &quot;But we daren't. In our regiment two officers</span>
<span class="s0">were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity</span>
<span class="s0">took command everything became straight forward. Now we see light...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then why was it forbidden?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Timokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to</span>
<span class="s0">answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy,&quot; said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. &quot;It is very sound: one</span>
<span class="s0">can't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to</span>
<span class="s0">marauding. At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might</span>
<span class="s0">outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand</span>
<span class="s0">this,&quot; cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily: &quot;he could not understand that there, for the first</span>
<span class="s0">time, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit</span>
<span class="s0">in the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the</span>
<span class="s0">French for two days, and that that success had increased our</span>
<span class="s0">strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and</span>
<span class="s0">losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried</span>
<span class="s0">to do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he</span>
<span class="s0">is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out</span>
<span class="s0">everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to.</span>
<span class="s0">How can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, and he</span>
<span class="s0">is a splendid valet and satisfies your father's requirements better</span>
<span class="s0">than you could, then it's all right to let him serve. But if your</span>
<span class="s0">father is mortally sick you'll send the valet away and attend to</span>
<span class="s0">your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will</span>
<span class="s0">soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it</span>
<span class="s0">has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could</span>
<span class="s0">serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in</span>
<span class="s0">danger she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been</span>
<span class="s0">making him out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the</span>
<span class="s0">only result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their false</span>
<span class="s0">accusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a</span>
<span class="s0">traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and</span>
<span class="s0">very punctilious German.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And they say he's a skillful commander,&quot; rejoined Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't understand what is meant by 'a skillful commander,'&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">replied Prince Andrew ironically.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A skillful commander?&quot; replied Pierre. &quot;Why, one who foresees all</span>
<span class="s0">contingencies... and foresees the adversary's intentions.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But that's impossible,&quot; said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter</span>
<span class="s0">settled long ago.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked at him in surprise.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?&quot; he remarked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, &quot;but with this little difference, that</span>
<span class="s0">in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are</span>
<span class="s0">not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is</span>
<span class="s0">always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than</span>
<span class="s0">one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division</span>
<span class="s0">and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies</span>
<span class="s0">of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,&quot; he went on, &quot;if</span>
<span class="s0">things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there</span>
<span class="s0">making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve</span>
<span class="s0">here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow's battle will depend and not on those others.... Success</span>
<span class="s0">never depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or</span>
<span class="s0">even on numbers, and least of all on position.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But on what then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the feeling that is in me and in him,&quot; he pointed to Timokhin,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;and in each soldier.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his commander in</span>
<span class="s0">alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from</span>
<span class="s0">expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we</span>
<span class="s0">lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal</span>
<span class="s0">to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the</span>
<span class="s0">battle, and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to</span>
<span class="s0">fight for there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as</span>
<span class="s0">we could. 'We've lost, so let us run,' and we ran. If we had not</span>
<span class="s0">said that till the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened.</span>
<span class="s0">But tomorrow we shan't say it! You talk about our position, the left</span>
<span class="s0">flank weak and the right flank too extended,&quot; he went on. &quot;That's</span>
<span class="s0">all nonsense, there's nothing of the kind. But what awaits us</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided</span>
<span class="s0">on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run,</span>
<span class="s0">and that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at</span>
<span class="s0">present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you have</span>
<span class="s0">ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder.</span>
<span class="s0">They are only concerned with their own petty interests.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At such a moment?&quot; said Pierre reproachfully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At such a moment!&quot; Prince Andrew repeated. &quot;To them it is only a</span>
<span class="s0">moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an</span>
<span class="s0">extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a</span>
<span class="s0">hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to</span>
<span class="s0">fight, and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight</span>
<span class="s0">and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will</span>
<span class="s0">win. And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and</span>
<span class="s0">whatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow's</span>
<span class="s0">battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There now, your excellency! That's the truth, the real truth,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Timokhin. &quot;Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my</span>
<span class="s0">battalion, believe me, wouldn't drink their vodka! 'It's not the day</span>
<span class="s0">for that!' they say.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the</span>
<span class="s0">shed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had</span>
<span class="s0">gone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a</span>
<span class="s0">conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses' hoofs on the</span>
<span class="s0">road not far from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack.</span>
<span class="s0">They rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily heard these words:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht</span>
<span class="s0">genug Preis geben,&quot;* said one of them.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently commend</span>
<span class="s0">that view.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, ja,&quot; said the other, &quot;der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwachen,</span>
<span class="s0">so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung</span>
<span class="s0">nehmen.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of course one</span>
<span class="s0">cannot take into account the loss of private individuals.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, no,&quot; agreed the other.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Extend widely!&quot; said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they</span>
<span class="s0">had ridden past. &quot;In that 'extend' were my father, son, and sister, at</span>
<span class="s0">Bald Hills. That's all the same to him! That's what I was saying to</span>
<span class="s0">you--those German gentlemen won't win the battle tomorrow but will</span>
<span class="s0">only make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their</span>
<span class="s0">German heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven't in</span>
<span class="s0">their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow--that which Timokhin has.</span>
<span class="s0">They have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us.</span>
<span class="s0">Fine teachers!&quot; and again his voice grew shrill.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you think we shall win tomorrow's battle?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; answered Prince Andrew absently. &quot;One thing I would do</span>

<span class="s0">if I had the power,&quot; he began again, &quot;I would not take prisoners.</span>
<span class="s0">Why take prisoners? It's chivalry! The French have destroyed my home</span>
<span class="s0">and are on their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are</span>
<span class="s0">outraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are</span>
<span class="s0">all criminals. And so thinks Timokhin and the whole army. They</span>
<span class="s0">should be executed! Since they are my foes they cannot be my</span>
<span class="s0">friends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew. &quot;I quite agree with you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill and</span>
<span class="s0">all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He</span>
<span class="s0">now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the</span>
<span class="s0">impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and</span>
<span class="s0">stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for</span>
<span class="s0">him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in</span>
<span class="s0">physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,</span>
<span class="s0">and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly,</span>
<span class="s0">and as it were lightheartedly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not take prisoners,&quot; Prince Andrew continued: &quot;That by itself would</span>
<span class="s0">quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have</span>
<span class="s0">played at war--that's what's vile! We play at magnanimity and all that</span>
<span class="s0">stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and</span>
<span class="s0">sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed:</span>
<span class="s0">she is so kind-hearted that she can't look at blood, but enjoys eating</span>
<span class="s0">the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of</span>
<span class="s0">chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on.</span>
<span class="s0">It's all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they</span>
<span class="s0">humbugged us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people's</span>
<span class="s0">houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my</span>
<span class="s0">children and my father, and then talk of rules of war and</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who</span>
<span class="s0">has come to this as I have through the same sufferings...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or</span>
<span class="s0">not Moscow was taken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly checked in his</span>
<span class="s0">speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a</span>
<span class="s0">few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips</span>
<span class="s0">quivered as he began speaking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war</span>
<span class="s0">only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then</span>
<span class="s0">there would not be war because Paul Ivanovich had offended Michael</span>
<span class="s0">Ivanovich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war!</span>
<span class="s0">And then the determination of the troops would be quite different.</span>
<span class="s0">Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading</span>
<span class="s0">would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in</span>
<span class="s0">Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the</span>
<span class="s0">most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not</span>
<span class="s0">play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and</span>
<span class="s0">seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be</span>
<span class="s0">war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the</span>
<span class="s0">idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are</span>
<span class="s0">the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of</span>
<span class="s0">war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a</span>
<span class="s0">country's inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army,</span>
<span class="s0">and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the</span>
<span class="s0">military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline,</span>
<span class="s0">idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in</span>
<span class="s0">spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.</span>
<span class="s0">All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he</span>
<span class="s0">who kills most people receives the highest rewards.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they</span>
<span class="s0">kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services</span>
<span class="s0">for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number),</span>
<span class="s0">and they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they</span>
<span class="s0">have killed the greater their achievement. How does God above look</span>
<span class="s0">at them and hear them?&quot; exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill,</span>
<span class="s0">piercing voice. &quot;Ah, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to</span>
<span class="s0">live. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn't</span>
<span class="s0">do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil....</span>
<span class="s0">Ah, well, it's not for long!&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;However, you're sleepy, and it's time for me to sleep. Go back to</span>
<span class="s0">Gorki!&quot; said Prince Andrew suddenly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh no!&quot; Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,</span>
<span class="s0">compassionate eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go, go! Before a battle one must have one's sleep out,&quot; repeated</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by, be off!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Whether we meet again or not...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.</span>

<span class="s0">It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the</span>
<span class="s0">expression of Prince Andrew's face was angry or tender.</span>

<span class="s0">For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should</span>
<span class="s0">follow him or go away. &quot;No, he does not want it!&quot; Pierre concluded.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And I know that this is our last meeting!&quot; He sighed deeply and</span>
<span class="s0">rode back to Gorki.</span>

<span class="s0">On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he</span>
<span class="s0">could not sleep.</span>

<span class="s0">He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his</span>
<span class="s0">imagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly</span>
<span class="s0">recalled an evening in Petersburg. Natasha with animated and excited</span>
<span class="s0">face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the</span>
<span class="s0">previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She</span>
<span class="s0">incoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a</span>
<span class="s0">talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to</span>
<span class="s0">say: &quot;No, I can't! I'm not telling it right; no, you don't</span>
<span class="s0">understand,&quot; though he encouraged her by saying that he did</span>
<span class="s0">understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say. But</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did</span>
<span class="s0">not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that</span>
<span class="s0">day and wished to convey. &quot;He was such a delightful old man, and it</span>
<span class="s0">was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can't</span>
<span class="s0">describe it,&quot; she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes. &quot;I understood her,&quot; he thought. &quot;I not only understood her,</span>
<span class="s0">but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that</span>
<span class="s0">frankness of soul--that very soul of hers which seemed to be</span>
<span class="s0">fettered by her body--it was that soul I loved in her... loved so</span>
<span class="s0">strongly and happily...&quot; and suddenly he remembered how his love had</span>
<span class="s0">ended. &quot;He did not need anything of that kind. He neither saw nor</span>
<span class="s0">understood anything of the sort. He only saw in her a pretty and fresh</span>
<span class="s0">young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?...</span>
<span class="s0">and he is still alive and gay!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again</span>
<span class="s0">began pacing up and down in front of the shed.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVI</span>


<span class="s0">On August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodino, M. de Beausset,</span>
<span class="s0">prefect of the French Emperor's palace, arrived at Napoleon's quarters</span>
<span class="s0">at Valuevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the</span>
<span class="s0">latter from Madrid.</span>

<span class="s0">Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had</span>
<span class="s0">brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first</span>
<span class="s0">compartment of Napoleon's tent, where he began opening the box while</span>
<span class="s0">conversing with Napoleon's aides-de-camp who surrounded him.</span>

<span class="s0">Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking</span>
<span class="s0">to some generals of his acquaintance.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was</span>
<span class="s0">finishing his toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now</span>
<span class="s0">his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his</span>
<span class="s0">valet was rubbing him down. Another valet, with his finger over the</span>
<span class="s0">mouth of a bottle, was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone</span>
<span class="s0">knew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">short hair was wet and matted on the forehead, but his face, though</span>
<span class="s0">puffy and yellow, expressed physical satisfaction. &quot;Go on, harder,</span>
<span class="s0">go on!&quot; he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him, slightly</span>
<span class="s0">twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who had entered the bedroom</span>
<span class="s0">to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in</span>
<span class="s0">yesterday's action, was standing by the door after delivering his</span>
<span class="s0">message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked</span>
<span class="s0">at him from under his brows.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No prisoners!&quot; said he, repeating the aide-de-camp's words. &quot;They</span>
<span class="s0">are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian army.... Go on... harder, harder!&quot; he muttered, hunching his</span>
<span class="s0">back and presenting his fat shoulders.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">said, nodding to the aide-de-camp.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of</span>
<span class="s0">the tent.</span>

<span class="s0">Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform</span>
<span class="s0">of the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.</span>

<span class="s0">De Beausset's hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the</span>
<span class="s0">present he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in</span>
<span class="s0">front of the entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such</span>
<span class="s0">unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the</span>
<span class="s0">surprise.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that</span>
<span class="s0">they were not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure</span>
<span class="s0">of giving him a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and</span>
<span class="s0">called Fabvier to him, listening silently and with a stern frown to</span>
<span class="s0">what Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops</span>
<span class="s0">fighting at Salamanca, at the other end of Europe, with but one</span>
<span class="s0">thought--to be worthy of their Emperor--and but one fear--to fail to</span>
<span class="s0">please him. The result of that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">made ironic remarks during Fabvier's account, as if he had not</span>
<span class="s0">expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I must make up for that in Moscow,&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;I'll see you</span>
<span class="s0">later,&quot; he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had</span>
<span class="s0">prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and</span>
<span class="s0">covered it with a cloth.</span>

<span class="s0">De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the</span>
<span class="s0">old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,</span>
<span class="s0">presenting an envelope.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most</span>
<span class="s0">cordial tone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire, all Paris regrets your absence,&quot; replied de Beausset as was</span>
<span class="s0">proper.</span>

<span class="s0">But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of</span>
<span class="s0">this kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he</span>
<span class="s0">was pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching</span>
<span class="s0">his ear.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am very sorry to have made you travel so far,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow,&quot; replied de Beausset.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absentmindedly, glanced to the</span>
<span class="s0">right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a</span>
<span class="s0">gold snuffbox, which he took.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it has happened luckily for you,&quot; he said, raising the open</span>
<span class="s0">snuffbox to his nose. &quot;You are fond of travel, and in three days you</span>
<span class="s0">will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic</span>
<span class="s0">capital. You will have a pleasant journey.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel</span>
<span class="s0">(of which he had not till then been aware).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha, what's this?&quot; asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers</span>
<span class="s0">were looking at something concealed under a cloth.</span>

<span class="s0">With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without</span>
<span class="s0">turning his back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the</span>
<span class="s0">cloth at the same time, and said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A present to Your Majesty from the Empress.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gerard, of the son</span>
<span class="s0">borne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy</span>
<span class="s0">whom for some reason everyone called &quot;The King of Rome.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the</span>
<span class="s0">Sistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball</span>
<span class="s0">represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a</span>
<span class="s0">scepter.</span>

<span class="s0">Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by</span>
<span class="s0">depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick,</span>
<span class="s0">the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all</span>
<span class="s0">who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The King of Rome!&quot; he said, pointing to the portrait with a</span>
<span class="s0">graceful gesture. &quot;Admirable!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the</span>
<span class="s0">expression of his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and</span>
<span class="s0">assumed a look of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said</span>
<span class="s0">and did would be historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be</span>
<span class="s0">best for him--whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball</span>
<span class="s0">with the terrestrial globe--to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the</span>
<span class="s0">simplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward,</span>
<span class="s0">glanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and</span>
<span class="s0">sat down on it before the portrait. At a single gesture from him</span>
<span class="s0">everyone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and</span>
<span class="s0">his emotion.</span>

<span class="s0">Having sat still for a while he touched--himself not knowing why-</span>
<span class="s0">the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the</span>
<span class="s0">portrait, rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He</span>
<span class="s0">ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old</span>
<span class="s0">Guard, stationed round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of</span>
<span class="s0">seeing the King of Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.</span>

<span class="s0">And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with</span>
<span class="s0">him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of</span>
<span class="s0">the officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the</span>
<span class="s0">portrait.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vive l'Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l'Empereur!&quot; came</span>
<span class="s0">those ecstatic cries.</span>

<span class="s0">After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset's presence dictated his</span>
<span class="s0">order of the day to the army.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Short and energetic!&quot; he remarked when he had read over the</span>
<span class="s0">proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections.</span>
<span class="s0">It ran:</span>


<span class="s0">Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends</span>
<span class="s0">on you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need:</span>
<span class="s0">comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you</span>
<span class="s0">did at Austerlitz, Friedland, Vitebsk, and Smolensk. Let our</span>
<span class="s0">remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride. Let</span>
<span class="s0">it be said of each of you: &quot;He was in the great battle before Moscow!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Before Moscow!&quot; repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who</span>
<span class="s0">was so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of</span>
<span class="s0">the tent to where the horses stood saddled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your Majesty is too kind!&quot; replied de Beausset to the invitation to</span>
<span class="s0">accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride</span>
<span class="s0">and was afraid of doing so.</span>

<span class="s0">But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount.</span>
<span class="s0">When Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before</span>
<span class="s0">his son's portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Take him away!&quot; he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic</span>
<span class="s0">gesture to the portrait. &quot;It is too soon for him to see a field of</span>
<span class="s0">battle.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to</span>
<span class="s0">indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">words.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVII</span>


<span class="s0">On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality,</span>
<span class="s0">considering plans submitted to him by his marshals, and personally</span>
<span class="s0">giving commands to his generals.</span>

<span class="s0">The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolocha</span>
<span class="s0">had been dislocated by the capture of the Shevardino Redoubt on the</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-fourth, and part of the line--the left flank--had been drawn</span>
<span class="s0">back. That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it</span>
<span class="s0">the ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to</span>
<span class="s0">anyone, military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It</span>
<span class="s0">would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this</span>
<span class="s0">conclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any need of that special and</span>
<span class="s0">supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon; yet the historians who described the event later and the men</span>
<span class="s0">who then surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a</span>
<span class="s0">profound air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head</span>
<span class="s0">dubiously, and without communicating to the generals around him the</span>
<span class="s0">profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them</span>
<span class="s0">his final conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a</span>
<span class="s0">suggestion from Davout, who was now called Prince d'Eckmuhl, to turn</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without</span>
<span class="s0">explaining why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to</span>
<span class="s0">attack the fleches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">agreed, though the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to</span>
<span class="s0">remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might</span>
<span class="s0">disorder the division.</span>

<span class="s0">Having inspected the country opposite the Shevardino Redoubt,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots</span>
<span class="s0">where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them,</span>
<span class="s0">the field artillery should be placed.</span>

<span class="s0">After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and</span>
<span class="s0">the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.</span>

<span class="s0">These dispositions, of which the French historians write with</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect, were as</span>
<span class="s0">follows:</span>


<span class="s0">At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the</span>
<span class="s0">plain occupied by the Prince d'Eckmuhl will open fire on the</span>
<span class="s0">opposing batteries of the enemy.</span>

<span class="s0">At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,</span>
<span class="s0">General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan's division and all</span>
<span class="s0">the howitzers of Dessaix's and Friant's divisions, will move</span>
<span class="s0">forward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy's</span>
<span class="s0">battery, against which will operate:</span>

        <span class="s0">24 guns of the artillery of the Guards</span>
        <span class="s0">30 guns of Campan's division</span>

<span class="s0">and      8 guns of Friant's and Dessaix's divisions</span>
        <span class="s0">--</span>

<span class="s0">in all  62 guns.</span>


<span class="s0">The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouche,</span>
<span class="s0">will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all,</span>
<span class="s0">on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on</span>
<span class="s0">the left, which will have forty guns in all directed against it.</span>

<span class="s0">General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all</span>
<span class="s0">the howitzers of the Guard's artillery against either one or other</span>
<span class="s0">of the entrenchments.</span>

<span class="s0">During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the</span>
<span class="s0">wood on the village and turn the enemy's position.</span>

<span class="s0">General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first</span>
<span class="s0">fortification.</span>

<span class="s0">After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given</span>
<span class="s0">in accordance with the enemy's movements.</span>

<span class="s0">The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of</span>
<span class="s0">the right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand's division and</span>
<span class="s0">of the vice-King's division will open a heavy fire on seeing the</span>
<span class="s0">attack commence on the right wing.</span>

<span class="s0">The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three</span>
<span class="s0">bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand's and Gibrard's</span>
<span class="s0">divisions, which under his leadership will be directed against the</span>
<span class="s0">redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.</span>

<span class="s0">All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et</span>
<span class="s0">methode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.</span>
   <span class="s0">The Imperial Camp near Mozhaysk,</span>
   <span class="s0">September, 6, 1812.</span>


<span class="s0">These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one</span>
<span class="s0">allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his</span>
<span class="s0">genius, related to Napoleon's orders to deal with four points--four</span>
<span class="s0">different orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.</span>

<span class="s0">In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the</span>
<span class="s0">spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouche; which</span>
<span class="s0">were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and</span>
<span class="s0">shower shells on the Russian fleches and redoubts. This could not be</span>
<span class="s0">done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not</span>
<span class="s0">carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until</span>
<span class="s0">the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon's instructions, moved them</span>
<span class="s0">forward.</span>

<span class="s0">The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through</span>
<span class="s0">the wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done</span>
<span class="s0">and was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village</span>
<span class="s0">through the wood, met Tuchkov there barring his way, and could not and</span>
<span class="s0">did not turn the Russian position.</span>

<span class="s0">The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to</span>
<span class="s0">seize the first fortification. General Campan's division did not seize</span>
<span class="s0">the first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from</span>
<span class="s0">the wood it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was</span>
<span class="s0">unaware.</span>

<span class="s0">The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village</span>
<span class="s0">(Borodino) and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same</span>
<span class="s0">heights as Morand's and Gdrard's divisions (for whose movements no</span>
<span class="s0">directions are given), which under his leadership will be directed</span>
<span class="s0">against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.</span>

<span class="s0">As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible</span>
<span class="s0">sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders</span>
<span class="s0">given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodino to the</span>
<span class="s0">redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gerard were to advance</span>
<span class="s0">simultaneously from the front.</span>

<span class="s0">All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could</span>
<span class="s0">not be executed. After passing through Borodino the vice-King was</span>
<span class="s0">driven back to the Kolocha and could get no farther; while the</span>
<span class="s0">divisions of Morand and Gerard did not take the redoubt but were</span>
<span class="s0">driven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle</span>
<span class="s0">by the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition was, or could</span>
<span class="s0">be, executed. But in the disposition it is said that, after the</span>
<span class="s0">fight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given in accordance</span>
<span class="s0">with the enemy's movements, and so it might be supposed that all</span>
<span class="s0">necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle.</span>
<span class="s0">But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know</span>
<span class="s0">the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight</span>
<span class="s0">could be executed.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>


<span class="s0">Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a</span>
<span class="s0">cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been</span>
<span class="s0">still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face</span>
<span class="s0">of the world have been changed. To historians who believe that</span>
<span class="s0">Russia was shaped by the will of one man--Peter the Great--and that</span>
<span class="s0">France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to</span>
<span class="s0">Russia at the will of one man--Napoleon--to say that Russia remained a</span>
<span class="s0">power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August</span>
<span class="s0">may seem logical and convincing.</span>

<span class="s0">If it had depended on Napoleon's will to fight or not to fight the</span>
<span class="s0">battle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement depended</span>
<span class="s0">on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of</span>
<span class="s0">his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who</span>
<span class="s0">omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth</span>
<span class="s0">would have been the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought</span>
<span class="s0">such a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction</span>
<span class="s0">Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he</span>
<span class="s0">saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX's</span>
<span class="s0">stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that Russia was</span>
<span class="s0">formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French Empire</span>
<span class="s0">was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic</span>
<span class="s0">events another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of</span>
<span class="s0">human events is predetermined from on high--depends on the coincidence</span>
<span class="s0">of the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">influence on the course of these events is purely external and</span>
<span class="s0">fictitious.</span>

<span class="s0">Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the</span>
<span class="s0">Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX's will, though</span>
<span class="s0">he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that</span>
<span class="s0">order; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of</span>
<span class="s0">eighty thousand men at Borodino was not due to Napoleon's will, though</span>
<span class="s0">he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it</span>
<span class="s0">was done because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions</span>
<span class="s0">appear, yet human dignity--which tells me that each of us is, if not</span>
<span class="s0">more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon--demands the</span>
<span class="s0">acceptance of that solution of the question, and historic</span>
<span class="s0">investigation abundantly confirms it.</span>

<span class="s0">At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.</span>
<span class="s0">That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who</span>
<span class="s0">killed people.</span>

<span class="s0">The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino not because of Napoleon's orders but by their own volition.</span>
<span class="s0">The whole army--French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch--hungry,</span>
<span class="s0">ragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army</span>
<span class="s0">blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be</span>
<span class="s0">drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians, they</span>
<span class="s0">would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because</span>
<span class="s0">it was inevitable.</span>

<span class="s0">When they heard Napoleon's proclamation offering them, as</span>
<span class="s0">compensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about</span>
<span class="s0">their having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried &quot;Vive</span>
<span class="s0">l'Empereur!&quot; just as they had cried &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; at the sight of</span>
<span class="s0">the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy</span>
<span class="s0">stick, and just as they would have cried &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; at any</span>
<span class="s0">nonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to</span>
<span class="s0">do but cry &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; and go to fight, in order to get food</span>
<span class="s0">and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's commands that they killed their fellow men.</span>

<span class="s0">And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for</span>
<span class="s0">none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know</span>
<span class="s0">what was going on before him. So the way in which these people</span>
<span class="s0">killed one another was not decided by Napoleon's will but occurred</span>
<span class="s0">independently of him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands</span>
<span class="s0">of people who took part in the common action. It only seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon that it all took place by his will. And so the question</span>
<span class="s0">whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than</span>
<span class="s0">the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was</span>
<span class="s0">the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former</span>
<span class="s0">occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as</span>
<span class="s0">previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.</span>

<span class="s0">The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even</span>
<span class="s0">better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories.</span>
<span class="s0">His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than</span>
<span class="s0">formerly, but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders</span>
<span class="s0">only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodino</span>
<span class="s0">was the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent</span>
<span class="s0">dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist</span>
<span class="s0">criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a</span>
<span class="s0">battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and</span>
<span class="s0">orders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to</span>
<span class="s0">demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been</span>
<span class="s0">won.</span>

<span class="s0">The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition,</span>
<span class="s0">but still they were criticized--criticized for their very</span>
<span class="s0">perfection, for their excessive minuteness.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon at the battle of Borodino fulfilled his office as</span>
<span class="s0">representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other</span>
<span class="s0">battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he</span>
<span class="s0">inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did</span>
<span class="s0">not contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the</span>
<span class="s0">field of battle, but with his great tact and military experience</span>
<span class="s0">carried out his role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIX</span>


<span class="s0">On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">remarked:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to</span>
<span class="s0">him about Paris and about some changes he meant to make the Empress'</span>
<span class="s0">household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details</span>
<span class="s0">relating to the court.</span>

<span class="s0">He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset's love</span>
<span class="s0">of travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon</span>
<span class="s0">who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on</span>
<span class="s0">his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head.</span>
<span class="s0">When the times comes to set to work I shall do it as no one else</span>
<span class="s0">could, but now I can jest, and the more I jest and the calmer I am the</span>
<span class="s0">more tranquil and confident you ought to be, and the more amazed at my</span>
<span class="s0">genius.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest</span>
<span class="s0">before the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next</span>
<span class="s0">day. He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to</span>
<span class="s0">sleep, and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the</span>
<span class="s0">dampness of the evening, he went into the large division of the tent</span>
<span class="s0">at three o'clock in the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked</span>
<span class="s0">whether the Russians had not withdrawn, and was told that the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy's fires were still in the same places. He nodded approval.</span>

<span class="s0">The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?&quot; Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">asked him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Without doubt, sire,&quot; replied Rapp.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon looked at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk?&quot; continued Rapp. &quot;The wine is drawn and must be drunk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head</span>
<span class="s0">on his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This poor army!&quot; he suddenly remarked. &quot;It has diminished greatly</span>
<span class="s0">since Smolensk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always</span>
<span class="s0">said so and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the</span>
<span class="s0">Guards are intact?&quot; he remarked interrogatively.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; replied Rapp.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his</span>
<span class="s0">watch. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for</span>
<span class="s0">the orders had all been given and were now being executed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of</span>
<span class="s0">the Guards?&quot; asked Napoleon sternly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The rice too?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor's order about the rice,</span>
<span class="s0">but Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing</span>
<span class="s0">that his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently</span>
<span class="s0">sipped his own.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have neither taste nor smell,&quot; he remarked, sniffing at his</span>
<span class="s0">glass. &quot;This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine--what is the</span>
<span class="s0">good of medicine when it can't cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these</span>
<span class="s0">lozenges but they don't help at all. What can doctors cure? One</span>
<span class="s0">can't cure anything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized</span>
<span class="s0">for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it</span>
<span class="s0">defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by</span>
<span class="s0">encumbering it with remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that</span>
<span class="s0">should go for a certain time; watchmaker cannot open it, he can only</span>
<span class="s0">adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just</span>
<span class="s0">a machine for living, that is all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was</span>
<span class="s0">fond, Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?&quot; asked he. &quot;It is the</span>
<span class="s0">art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That's all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Rapp made no reply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutuzov!&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;We</span>
<span class="s0">shall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three</span>
<span class="s0">weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his</span>
<span class="s0">entrenchments.... We shall see!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He looked at his watch. It was still only four o'clock. He did not</span>
<span class="s0">feel sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do.</span>
<span class="s0">He rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went</span>
<span class="s0">out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible</span>
<span class="s0">moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were</span>
<span class="s0">dimly burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and</span>
<span class="s0">the rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to</span>
<span class="s0">take up their positions were clearly audible.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires</span>
<span class="s0">and listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman</span>
<span class="s0">in a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had</span>
<span class="s0">drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">stopped in front of him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What year did you enter the service?&quot; he asked with that</span>
<span class="s0">affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always</span>
<span class="s0">addressed the soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">The man answered the question.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It has, Your Majesty.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon nodded and walked away.</span>


<span class="s0">At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevardino.</span>

<span class="s0">It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud</span>
<span class="s0">lay in the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out</span>
<span class="s0">in the faint morning light.</span>

<span class="s0">On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died</span>
<span class="s0">away in the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a</span>
<span class="s0">third report shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed</span>
<span class="s0">solemnly near by on the right.</span>

<span class="s0">The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang</span>
<span class="s0">out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevardino Redoubt where he</span>
<span class="s0">dismounted. The game had begun.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXX</span>


<span class="s0">On returning to Gorki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the</span>
<span class="s0">morning, and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a</span>
<span class="s0">corner Boris had given up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already</span>
<span class="s0">left the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his</span>
<span class="s0">groom was shaking him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!&quot; he kept</span>
<span class="s0">repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without</span>
<span class="s0">looking at him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? Has it begun? Is it time?&quot; Pierre asked, waking up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hear the firing,&quot; said the groom, a discharged soldier. &quot;All the</span>
<span class="s0">gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past</span>
<span class="s0">long ago.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was</span>
<span class="s0">bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from</span>
<span class="s0">behind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still</span>
<span class="s0">half broken by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on</span>
<span class="s0">the dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on</span>
<span class="s0">the windows, the fence, and on Pierre's horses standing before the</span>
<span class="s0">hut. The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's time, Count; it's time!&quot; cried the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down</span>
<span class="s0">the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of</span>
<span class="s0">battle the day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there,</span>
<span class="s0">members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov's gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his</span>
<span class="s0">gray nape sunk between his shoulders. He was looking through a field</span>
<span class="s0">glass down the highroad before him.</span>

<span class="s0">Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before</span>
<span class="s0">him, spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired</span>
<span class="s0">from that spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of</span>
<span class="s0">troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting</span>
<span class="s0">rays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of</span>
<span class="s0">rosy, golden tinted light and long dark shadows. The forest at the</span>
<span class="s0">farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious</span>
<span class="s0">stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was</span>
<span class="s0">silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valuevo by</span>
<span class="s0">the Smolensk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered</span>
<span class="s0">golden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be</span>
<span class="s0">seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was</span>
<span class="s0">vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all</span>
<span class="s0">was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodino and the hollows on</span>
<span class="s0">both sides of the Kolocha.</span>

<span class="s0">Above the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of it, especially</span>
<span class="s0">to the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls</span>
<span class="s0">into the Kolocha, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve,</span>
<span class="s0">and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and</span>
<span class="s0">magically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns</span>
<span class="s0">mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through that</span>
<span class="s0">mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing back like</span>
<span class="s0">lightning from the water, from the dew, and from the bayonets of the</span>
<span class="s0">troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodino. A white</span>
<span class="s0">church could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of</span>
<span class="s0">huts in Borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green</span>
<span class="s0">ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move,</span>
<span class="s0">as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in</span>
<span class="s0">the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino, so along the entire line</span>
<span class="s0">outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the</span>
<span class="s0">left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds</span>
<span class="s0">of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now</span>
<span class="s0">singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others dense,</span>
<span class="s0">which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over the</span>
<span class="s0">whole expanse.</span>

<span class="s0">These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of</span>
<span class="s0">the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Puff!&quot;--suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging</span>
<span class="s0">from violet into gray and milky white, and &quot;boom!&quot; came the report a</span>
<span class="s0">second later.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Puff! puff!&quot;--and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending</span>
<span class="s0">together; and &quot;boom, boom!&quot; came the sounds confirming what the eye</span>
<span class="s0">had seen.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a</span>
<span class="s0">round compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke</span>
<span class="s0">floating to one side, and--&quot;puff&quot; (with a pause)--&quot;puff, puff!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">three and then four more appeared and then from each, with the same</span>
<span class="s0">interval--&quot;boom--boom, boom!&quot; came the fine, firm, precise sounds in</span>
<span class="s0">reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran</span>
<span class="s0">past them. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of</span>
<span class="s0">smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports,</span>
<span class="s0">while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the</span>
<span class="s0">muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had</span>
<span class="s0">their little echoes in just the same way. &quot;Trakh-ta-ta-takh!&quot; came the</span>
<span class="s0">frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in</span>
<span class="s0">comparison with the reports of the cannon.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets,</span>
<span class="s0">that movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov and</span>
<span class="s0">his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They</span>
<span class="s0">were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining</span>
<span class="s0">with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before</span>
<span class="s0">and had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!&quot; Kutuzov was</span>
<span class="s0">saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from</span>
<span class="s0">the battlefield.</span>

<span class="s0">Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way</span>
<span class="s0">down the knoll.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To the crossing!&quot; said the general coldly and sternly in reply to</span>
<span class="s0">one of the staff who asked where he was going.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll go there too, I too!&quot; thought Pierre, and followed the</span>
<span class="s0">general.</span>

<span class="s0">The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went</span>
<span class="s0">to his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the</span>
<span class="s0">quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out</span>
<span class="s0">his toes pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his</span>
<span class="s0">spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and</span>
<span class="s0">reins, he galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to</span>
<span class="s0">smile as they watched him from the knoll.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXI</span>


<span class="s0">Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was</span>
<span class="s0">galloping turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him,</span>
<span class="s0">galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He</span>
<span class="s0">tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left, but</span>
<span class="s0">there were soldiers everywhere, all with expression and busy with some</span>
<span class="s0">unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white</span>
<span class="s0">hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under</span>
<span class="s0">his horse's hoofs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why ride into the middle of the battalion?&quot; one of them shouted</span>
<span class="s0">at him.</span>

<span class="s0">Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying</span>
<span class="s0">horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood</span>
<span class="s0">firing. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had</span>
<span class="s0">come to the bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino,</span>
<span class="s0">which the French (having occupied Borodino) were attacking in the</span>
<span class="s0">first phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front</span>
<span class="s0">of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it</span>
<span class="s0">and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken</span>
<span class="s0">no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but</span>
<span class="s0">despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this</span>
<span class="s0">was the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of the bullets</span>
<span class="s0">whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him,</span>
<span class="s0">did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him.</span>
<span class="s0">He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why's that fellow in front of the line?&quot; shouted somebody at him</span>
<span class="s0">again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To the left!... Keep to the right!&quot; the men shouted to him.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of</span>
<span class="s0">Raevski's adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at</span>
<span class="s0">him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing</span>
<span class="s0">him he nodded.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How have you got here?&quot; he said, and galloped on.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid</span>
<span class="s0">of getting in someone's way again, galloped after the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's happening here? May I come with you?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One moment, one moment!&quot; replied the adjutant, and riding up to a</span>
<span class="s0">stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message</span>
<span class="s0">and then addressed Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why have you come here, Count?&quot; he asked with a smile. &quot;Still</span>
<span class="s0">inquisitive?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; assented Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here it's tolerable,&quot; said he, &quot;but with Bagration on the left</span>
<span class="s0">flank they're getting it frightfully hot.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Really?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Where is that?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and</span>
<span class="s0">in our battery it is still bearable,&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;Will you</span>
<span class="s0">come?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I'll come with you,&quot; replied Pierre, looking round for his</span>
<span class="s0">groom.</span>

<span class="s0">It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or</span>
<span class="s0">being carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over</span>
<span class="s0">the day before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay,</span>
<span class="s0">with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why haven't they carried him away?&quot; Pierre was about to ask, but</span>
<span class="s0">seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking</span>
<span class="s0">that way, he checked himself.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the</span>
<span class="s0">adjutant to Raevski's Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the</span>
<span class="s0">adjutant's and jolted him at every step.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You don't seem to be used to riding, Count?&quot; remarked the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No it's not that, but her action seems so jerky,&quot; said Pierre in</span>
<span class="s0">a puzzled tone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why... she's wounded!&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;In the off foreleg above</span>
<span class="s0">the knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your</span>
<span class="s0">baptism of fire!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the</span>
<span class="s0">artillery which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening</span>
<span class="s0">them with the noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was</span>
<span class="s0">cool and quiet, with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant</span>
<span class="s0">dismounted and walked up the hill on foot.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is the general here?&quot; asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,&quot; someone</span>
<span class="s0">told him, pointing to the right.</span>

<span class="s0">The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't trouble about me,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I'll go up onto the knoll if</span>
<span class="s0">I may?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, do. You'll see everything from there and it's less</span>
<span class="s0">dangerous, and I'll come for you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not</span>
<span class="s0">meet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm</span>
<span class="s0">that day.</span>

<span class="s0">The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards</span>
<span class="s0">known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski's Redoubt, and</span>
<span class="s0">to the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du</span>
<span class="s0">centre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French</span>
<span class="s0">regarded as the key to the whole position.</span>

<span class="s0">This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which</span>
<span class="s0">trenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that</span>
<span class="s0">were being fired through openings in the earthwork.</span>

<span class="s0">In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also</span>
<span class="s0">fired incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When</span>
<span class="s0">ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which</span>
<span class="s0">small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was</span>
<span class="s0">the most important point of the battle.</span>

<span class="s0">On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought</span>
<span class="s0">it one of the least significant parts of the field.</span>

<span class="s0">Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench</span>
<span class="s0">surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with</span>
<span class="s0">an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about</span>
<span class="s0">the battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running</span>
<span class="s0">past him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being</span>
<span class="s0">fired continually one after another with a deafening roar,</span>
<span class="s0">enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke.</span>

<span class="s0">In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in</span>
<span class="s0">support, here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their</span>
<span class="s0">work were separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced</span>
<span class="s0">a common and as it were family feeling of animation.</span>

<span class="s0">The intrusion of Pierre's nonmilitary figure in a white hat made</span>
<span class="s0">an unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at</span>
<span class="s0">him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior</span>
<span class="s0">artillery officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over</span>
<span class="s0">to Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at</span>
<span class="s0">him with curiosity.</span>

<span class="s0">A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only</span>
<span class="s0">just out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two</span>
<span class="s0">guns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sir,&quot; he said, &quot;permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not</span>
<span class="s0">be here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the</span>
<span class="s0">white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of</span>
<span class="s0">the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if</span>
<span class="s0">he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust gradually</span>
<span class="s0">began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that</span>
<span class="s0">live with the regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their</span>
<span class="s0">family, adopted him, gave him a nickname (&quot;our gentleman&quot;), and made</span>
<span class="s0">kindly fun of him among themselves.</span>

<span class="s0">A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around</span>
<span class="s0">with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown</span>
<span class="s0">up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?&quot; a red-faced,</span>
<span class="s0">broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a</span>
<span class="s0">set of sound, white teeth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are you afraid, then?&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What else do you expect?&quot; answered the soldier. &quot;She has no</span>
<span class="s0">mercy, you know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards.</span>
<span class="s0">One can't help being afraid,&quot; he said laughing.</span>

<span class="s0">Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.</span>
<span class="s0">They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and</span>
<span class="s0">the discovery that he did so delighted them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it's</span>
<span class="s0">wonderful! There's a gentleman for you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To your places!&quot; cried the young officer to the men gathered</span>
<span class="s0">round Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the</span>
<span class="s0">first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and</span>
<span class="s0">the men with great precision and formality.</span>

<span class="s0">The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing</span>
<span class="s0">more intense over the whole field, especially to the left where</span>
<span class="s0">Bagration's fleches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing</span>
<span class="s0">made it almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole</span>
<span class="s0">attention was engrossed by watching the family circle--separated</span>
<span class="s0">from all else--formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the</span>
<span class="s0">battlefield was now replaced by another, especially since he had</span>
<span class="s0">seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the</span>
<span class="s0">slope of the trench, he observed the faces of those around him.</span>

<span class="s0">By ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from</span>
<span class="s0">the battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more</span>
<span class="s0">frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled</span>
<span class="s0">around. But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and</span>
<span class="s0">merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A live one!&quot; shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not this way! To the infantry!&quot; added another with loud laughter,</span>
<span class="s0">seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are you bowing to a friend, eh?&quot; remarked another, chaffing a</span>
<span class="s0">peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.</span>

<span class="s0">Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out</span>
<span class="s0">to see what was happening in front.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They've withdrawn the front line, it has retired,&quot; said they,</span>
<span class="s0">pointing over the earthwork.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mind your own business,&quot; an old sergeant shouted at them. &quot;If</span>
<span class="s0">they've retired it's because there's work for them to do farther</span>
<span class="s0">back.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a</span>
<span class="s0">shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To the fifth gun, wheel it up!&quot; came shouts from one side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, all together, like bargees!&quot; rose the merry voices of</span>
<span class="s0">those who were moving the gun.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman's hat off!&quot; cried the</span>
<span class="s0">red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. &quot;Awkward</span>
<span class="s0">baggage!&quot; he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon</span>
<span class="s0">wheel and a man's leg.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, you foxes!&quot; said another, laughing at some militiamen</span>
<span class="s0">who, stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So this gruel isn't to your taste? Oh, you crows! You're scared!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man</span>
<span class="s0">whose leg had been torn off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, lads... oh, oh!&quot; they mimicked the peasants, &quot;they don't</span>
<span class="s0">like it at all!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after</span>
<span class="s0">every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.</span>

<span class="s0">As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly</span>
<span class="s0">and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in</span>
<span class="s0">opposition to what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire</span>
<span class="s0">growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned</span>
<span class="s0">to know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching</span>
<span class="s0">this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was</span>
<span class="s0">flaming up in the same way in his own soul.</span>

<span class="s0">At ten o'clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in</span>
<span class="s0">front of the battery and along the Kamenka streamlet retreated. From</span>
<span class="s0">the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their</span>
<span class="s0">wounded on their muskets. A general with his suite came to the</span>
<span class="s0">battery, and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look</span>
<span class="s0">and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the</span>
<span class="s0">battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from</span>
<span class="s0">amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the</span>
<span class="s0">sound of a drum and shouts of command, and from the battery one saw</span>
<span class="s0">how those ranks of infantry moved forward.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly</span>
<span class="s0">struck by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was</span>
<span class="s0">walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.</span>

<span class="s0">The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their</span>
<span class="s0">long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few</span>
<span class="s0">minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back</span>
<span class="s0">from that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently</span>
<span class="s0">in the battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed.</span>
<span class="s0">Around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No</span>
<span class="s0">one any longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted</span>
<span class="s0">at for being in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid</span>
<span class="s0">strides from one gun to another with a frowning face. The young</span>
<span class="s0">officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more</span>
<span class="s0">scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned,</span>
<span class="s0">loaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave</span>
<span class="s0">little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs.</span>

<span class="s0">The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire</span>
<span class="s0">which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing</span>
<span class="s0">beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his</span>
<span class="s0">shako, ran up to his superior.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left.</span>
<span class="s0">Are we to continue firing?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Grapeshot!&quot; the senior shouted, without answering the question,</span>
<span class="s0">looking over the wall of the trench.</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and</span>
<span class="s0">bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing.</span>
<span class="s0">Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre's eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the</span>
<span class="s0">earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these</span>
<span class="s0">sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot; were running not forwards but backwards,</span>
<span class="s0">it seemed to Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he</span>
<span class="s0">was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some</span>
<span class="s0">militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All with grapeshot!&quot; shouted the officer.</span>

<span class="s0">The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper</span>
<span class="s0">informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is</span>
<span class="s0">no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The scoundrels! What are they doing?&quot; shouted the officer,</span>
<span class="s0">turning to Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer's face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered</span>
<span class="s0">under his frowning brow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">yelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite</span>
<span class="s0">side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't fire.... Wait!&quot; he shouted.</span>

<span class="s0">The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, sir, this is no place for you,&quot; said he, and ran down the</span>
<span class="s0">slope.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer</span>
<span class="s0">was sitting.</span>

<span class="s0">One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in</span>
<span class="s0">front, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. &quot;Where am</span>
<span class="s0">I going?&quot; he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green</span>
<span class="s0">ammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to</span>
<span class="s0">return or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to</span>
<span class="s0">the ground. At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of</span>
<span class="s0">flame, and immediately a deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made</span>
<span class="s0">his ears tingle.</span>

<span class="s0">When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on</span>
<span class="s0">his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer</span>
<span class="s0">existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched</span>
<span class="s0">grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it,</span>
<span class="s0">galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground,</span>
<span class="s0">uttering prolonged and piercing cries.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXII</span>


<span class="s0">Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the</span>
<span class="s0">battery, as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.</span>

<span class="s0">On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing</span>
<span class="s0">something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery.</span>
<span class="s0">He had no time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior</span>
<span class="s0">officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were</span>
<span class="s0">examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had</span>
<span class="s0">noticed before was struggling forward shouting &quot;Brothers!&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the</span>
<span class="s0">arm. He also saw something else that was strange.</span>

<span class="s0">But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed,</span>
<span class="s0">that the soldier shouting &quot;Brothers!&quot; was a prisoner, and that another</span>
<span class="s0">man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had</span>
<span class="s0">he run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in</span>
<span class="s0">a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something.</span>
<span class="s0">Instinctively guarding against the shock--for they had been running</span>
<span class="s0">together at full speed before they saw one another--Pierre put out his</span>
<span class="s0">hands and seized the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one</span>
<span class="s0">hand and by the throat with the other. The officer, dropping his</span>
<span class="s0">sword, seized Pierre by his collar.</span>

<span class="s0">For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another's</span>
<span class="s0">unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and</span>
<span class="s0">what they were to do next. &quot;Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him</span>
<span class="s0">prisoner?&quot; each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently</span>
<span class="s0">more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">strong hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever</span>
<span class="s0">tighter and tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when</span>
<span class="s0">just above their heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled,</span>
<span class="s0">and it seemed to Pierre that the French officer's head had been torn</span>
<span class="s0">off, so swiftly had he ducked it.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further</span>
<span class="s0">thought as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to</span>
<span class="s0">the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead</span>
<span class="s0">and wounded who, it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he</span>
<span class="s0">reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers who, stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and</span>
<span class="s0">wildly toward the battery. (This was the attack for which Ermolov</span>
<span class="s0">claimed the credit, declaring that only his courage and good luck made</span>
<span class="s0">such a feat possible: it was the attack in which he was said to have</span>
<span class="s0">thrown some St. George's Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery</span>
<span class="s0">for the first soldiers to take who got there.)</span>

<span class="s0">The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops</span>
<span class="s0">shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot; pursued them so far beyond the battery that it</span>
<span class="s0">was difficult to call them back.</span>

<span class="s0">The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them</span>
<span class="s0">was a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds</span>
<span class="s0">of wounded--some known to Pierre and some unknown--Russians and</span>
<span class="s0">French, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were</span>
<span class="s0">carried on stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto</span>
<span class="s0">the knoll where he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle</span>
<span class="s0">which had received him as a member he did not find a single one. There</span>
<span class="s0">were many dead whom he did not know, but some he recognized. The young</span>
<span class="s0">officer still sat in the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood</span>
<span class="s0">at the edge of the earth wall. The red-faced man was still</span>
<span class="s0">twitching, but they did not carry him away.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre ran down the slope once more.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have</span>
<span class="s0">done!&quot; he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers</span>
<span class="s0">moving from the battlefield.</span>

<span class="s0">But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front</span>
<span class="s0">and especially to the left, near Semenovsk, something seemed to be</span>
<span class="s0">seething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not</span>
<span class="s0">diminish, but even increased to desperation like a man who,</span>
<span class="s0">straining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>


<span class="s0">The chief action of the battle of Borodino was fought within the</span>
<span class="s0">seven thousand feet between Borodino and Bagration's fleches. Beyond</span>
<span class="s0">that space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the</span>
<span class="s0">Russians with Uvarov's cavalry at midday, and on the other side,</span>
<span class="s0">beyond Utitsa, Poniatowski's collision with Tuchkov; but these two</span>
<span class="s0">were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in</span>
<span class="s0">the center of the battlefield. On the field between Borodino and the</span>
<span class="s0">fleches, beside the wood, the chief action of the day took place on an</span>
<span class="s0">open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest</span>
<span class="s0">and most artless way.</span>

<span class="s0">The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred</span>
<span class="s0">guns.</span>

<span class="s0">Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,</span>
<span class="s0">Campan's and Dessaix's, advanced from the French right, while</span>
<span class="s0">Murat's troops advanced on Borodino from their left.</span>

<span class="s0">From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the</span>
<span class="s0">fleches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as</span>
<span class="s0">the crow flies to Borodino, so that Napoleon could not see what was</span>
<span class="s0">happening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid</span>
<span class="s0">the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix's division advancing</span>
<span class="s0">against the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the</span>
<span class="s0">hollow that lay between them and the fleches. As soon as they had</span>
<span class="s0">descended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and musketry on</span>
<span class="s0">the fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that</span>
<span class="s0">side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something</span>
<span class="s0">black--probably men--and at times the glint of bayonets. But whether</span>
<span class="s0">they were moving or stationary, whether they were French or Russian,</span>
<span class="s0">could not be discovered from the Shevardino Redoubt.</span>

<span class="s0">The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight</span>
<span class="s0">into Napoleon's face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked</span>
<span class="s0">at the fleches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it</span>
<span class="s0">looked as if the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved.</span>
<span class="s0">Sometimes shouts were heard through the firing, but it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to tell what was being done there.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and</span>
<span class="s0">in its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he</span>
<span class="s0">could not tell where what he had seen was.</span>

<span class="s0">He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.</span>

<span class="s0">Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed</span>
<span class="s0">intently at the battlefield.</span>

<span class="s0">But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from</span>
<span class="s0">where he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which</span>
<span class="s0">some of his generals had taken their stand, but even from the</span>
<span class="s0">fleches themselves--in which by this time there were now Russian and</span>
<span class="s0">now French soldiers, alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive,</span>
<span class="s0">frightened, or maddened--even at those fleches themselves it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to make out what was taking place. There for several</span>
<span class="s0">hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire, now Russians were</span>
<span class="s0">seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, and now cavalry: they</span>
<span class="s0">appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to do with one</span>
<span class="s0">another, screamed, and ran back again.</span>

<span class="s0">From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from</span>
<span class="s0">his marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the</span>
<span class="s0">progress of the action, but all these reports were false, both because</span>
<span class="s0">it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at</span>
<span class="s0">any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the</span>
<span class="s0">actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others;</span>
<span class="s0">and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already</span>
<span class="s0">becoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings</span>
<span class="s0">that Borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolocha was in</span>
<span class="s0">the hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished</span>
<span class="s0">the troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should</span>
<span class="s0">form up on the farther side and wait. But before that order was given-</span>
<span class="s0">almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodino--the bridge</span>
<span class="s0">had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at</span>
<span class="s0">which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle.</span>

<span class="s0">An adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and</span>
<span class="s0">frightened face and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been</span>
<span class="s0">repulsed, Campan wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time</span>
<span class="s0">the adjutant had been told that the French had been repulsed, the</span>
<span class="s0">fleches had in fact been recaptured by other French troops, and Davout</span>
<span class="s0">was alive and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily</span>
<span class="s0">untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either</span>
<span class="s0">been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not</span>
<span class="s0">executed.</span>

<span class="s0">The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle</span>
<span class="s0">but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and</span>
<span class="s0">only occasionally went within musket range, made their own</span>
<span class="s0">arrangements without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in</span>
<span class="s0">what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry</span>
<span class="s0">should run. But even their orders, like Napoleon's, were seldom</span>
<span class="s0">carried out, and then but partially. For the most part things happened</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on</span>
<span class="s0">meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they were,</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed</span>
<span class="s0">back and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without orders in</span>
<span class="s0">pursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry regiments</span>
<span class="s0">galloped through the Semenovsk hollow and as soon as they reached</span>
<span class="s0">the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back</span>
<span class="s0">again. The infantry moved in the same way, sometimes running to</span>
<span class="s0">quite other places than those they were ordered to go to. All orders</span>
<span class="s0">as to where and when to move the guns, when to send infantry to</span>
<span class="s0">shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry--all such orders</span>
<span class="s0">were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned,</span>
<span class="s0">without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less Napoleon.</span>
<span class="s0">They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or</span>
<span class="s0">for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at stake</span>
<span class="s0">is what is dearest to man--his own life--and it sometimes seems that</span>
<span class="s0">safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these</span>
<span class="s0">men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the</span>
<span class="s0">mood of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward</span>
<span class="s0">and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops.</span>
<span class="s0">All their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the</span>
<span class="s0">harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that</span>
<span class="s0">flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about. As</span>
<span class="s0">soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying</span>
<span class="s0">about, their superiors, located in the background, re-formed them</span>
<span class="s0">and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that</span>
<span class="s0">discipline led them back to the zone of fire, where under the</span>
<span class="s0">influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about</span>
<span class="s0">according to the chance promptings of the throng.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>


<span class="s0">Napoleon's generals--Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that</span>
<span class="s0">region of fire and sometimes even entered it--repeatedly led into it</span>
<span class="s0">huge masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always</span>
<span class="s0">happened in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of</span>
<span class="s0">the enemy's flight, these orderly masses returned thence as</span>
<span class="s0">disorganized and terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but</span>
<span class="s0">their numbers constantly decreased. In the middle of the day Murat</span>
<span class="s0">sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when</span>
<span class="s0">Murat's adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would</span>
<span class="s0">be routed if His Majesty would let him have another division.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Reinforcements?&quot; said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking</span>
<span class="s0">at the adjutant--a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like</span>
<span class="s0">Murat's own--as though he did not understand his words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Reinforcements!&quot; thought Napoleon to himself. &quot;How can they need</span>
<span class="s0">reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a</span>
<span class="s0">weak, unentrenched Russian wing?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tell the King of Naples,&quot; said he sternly, &quot;that it is not noon</span>
<span class="s0">yet, and I don't yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without</span>
<span class="s0">removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were</span>
<span class="s0">being slaughtered.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began</span>
<span class="s0">talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.</span>

<span class="s0">In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon, Berthier's eyes turned to look at a general with a suite,</span>
<span class="s0">who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was</span>
<span class="s0">Belliard. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid</span>
<span class="s0">strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity</span>
<span class="s0">of sending reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians</span>
<span class="s0">were lost if the Emperor would give another division.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down</span>
<span class="s0">without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the</span>
<span class="s0">generals of the suite around him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are very fiery, Belliard,&quot; said Napoleon, when he again came up</span>
<span class="s0">to the general. &quot;In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake.</span>
<span class="s0">Go and have another look and then come back to me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of</span>
<span class="s0">the battlefield galloped up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, what do you want?&quot; asked Napoleon in the tone of a man</span>
<span class="s0">irritated at being continually disturbed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire, the prince...&quot; began the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Asks for reinforcements?&quot; said Napoleon with an angry gesture.</span>

<span class="s0">The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came</span>
<span class="s0">back, and called Berthier.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We must give reserves,&quot; he said, moving his arms slightly apart.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Who do you think should be sent there?&quot; he asked of Berthier (whom he</span>
<span class="s0">subsequently termed &quot;that gosling I have made an eagle&quot;).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Send Claparede's division, sire,&quot; replied Berthier, who knew all</span>
<span class="s0">the divisions regiments, and battalions by heart.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon nodded assent.</span>

<span class="s0">The adjutant galloped to Claparede's division and a few minutes</span>
<span class="s0">later the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon gazed silently in that direction.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No!&quot; he suddenly said to Berthier. &quot;I can't send Claparede. Send</span>
<span class="s0">Friant's division.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Though there was no advantage in sending Friant's division instead</span>
<span class="s0">of Claparede's, and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in</span>
<span class="s0">stopping Claparede and sending Friant now, the order was carried out</span>
<span class="s0">exactly. Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was</span>
<span class="s0">playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines--a role he</span>
<span class="s0">so justly understood and condemned.</span>

<span class="s0">Friant's division disappeared as the others had done into the</span>
<span class="s0">smoke of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive</span>
<span class="s0">at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all</span>
<span class="s0">asked for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding</span>
<span class="s0">their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the</span>
<span class="s0">French army was melting away.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.</span>

<span class="s0">M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since</span>
<span class="s0">morning, came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest</span>
<span class="s0">lunch to His Majesty.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the</span>
<span class="s0">negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de</span>
<span class="s0">Beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is</span>
<span class="s0">no reason for not having lunch when one can get it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go away...&quot; exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned</span>
<span class="s0">aside.</span>

<span class="s0">A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M.</span>
<span class="s0">de Beausset's face and he glided away to the other generals.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an</span>
<span class="s0">ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and</span>
<span class="s0">always winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances</span>
<span class="s0">of the game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely</span>
<span class="s0">he loses.</span>

<span class="s0">His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same</span>
<span class="s0">preparations had been made, the same dispositions, and the same</span>
<span class="s0">proclamation courte et energique, he himself was still the same: he</span>
<span class="s0">knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and</span>
<span class="s0">skillful than before. Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and</span>
<span class="s0">Friedland--yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally</span>
<span class="s0">become impotent.</span>

<span class="s0">All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with</span>
<span class="s0">success: the concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by</span>
<span class="s0">reserves to break the enemy's line, and a cavalry attack by &quot;the men</span>
<span class="s0">of iron,&quot; all these methods had already been employed, yet not only</span>
<span class="s0">was there no victory, but from all sides came the same news of</span>
<span class="s0">generals killed and wounded, of reinforcements needed, of the</span>
<span class="s0">impossibility of driving back the Russians, and of disorganization</span>
<span class="s0">among his own troops.</span>

<span class="s0">Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few</span>
<span class="s0">phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with</span>
<span class="s0">congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the</span>
<span class="s0">corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon</span>
<span class="s0">and stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to</span>
<span class="s0">gather in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola,</span>
<span class="s0">Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was</span>
<span class="s0">happening to his troops.</span>

<span class="s0">Despite news of the capture of the fleches, Napoleon saw that this</span>
<span class="s0">was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his</span>
<span class="s0">former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the</span>
<span class="s0">men about him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked</span>
<span class="s0">dejected, and they all shunned one another's eyes--only a de</span>
<span class="s0">Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening.</span>

<span class="s0">But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning</span>
<span class="s0">of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all</span>
<span class="s0">efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and</span>
<span class="s0">that the least accident might now--with the fight balanced on such a</span>
<span class="s0">strained center--destroy him and his army.</span>

<span class="s0">When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign</span>
<span class="s0">in which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or</span>
<span class="s0">cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he</span>
<span class="s0">looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard</span>
<span class="s0">reports of the Russians still holding their ground--a terrible feeling</span>
<span class="s0">like a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents</span>
<span class="s0">that might destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall</span>
<span class="s0">on his left wing, might break through his center, he himself might</span>
<span class="s0">be killed by a stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former</span>
<span class="s0">battles he had only considered the possibilities of success, but now</span>
<span class="s0">innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves, and he expected them</span>
<span class="s0">all. Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is</span>
<span class="s0">coming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a</span>
<span class="s0">terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels</span>
<span class="s0">that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of</span>
<span class="s0">unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness.</span>

<span class="s0">The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the</span>
<span class="s0">French army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a</span>
<span class="s0">campstool below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees.</span>
<span class="s0">Berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line</span>
<span class="s0">to ascertain the position of affairs.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What do you say?&quot; asked Napoleon. &quot;Yes, tell them to bring me</span>
<span class="s0">my horse.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He mounted and rode toward Semenovsk.</span>

<span class="s0">Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space</span>
<span class="s0">through which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of</span>
<span class="s0">blood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals</span>
<span class="s0">had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small</span>
<span class="s0">area. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the</span>
<span class="s0">ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does</span>
<span class="s0">to tableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semenovsk,</span>
<span class="s0">and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color</span>
<span class="s0">unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk village and its</span>
<span class="s0">knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent</span>
<span class="s0">forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a</span>
<span class="s0">continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French</span>
<span class="s0">or the Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the</span>
<span class="s0">reverie from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what</span>
<span class="s0">was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed</span>
<span class="s0">by him and to depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair,</span>
<span class="s0">for the first time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.</span>

<span class="s0">One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to</span>
<span class="s0">lead the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon, exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this</span>
<span class="s0">general's senseless offer.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed!&quot; he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevardino.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXV</span>


<span class="s0">On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning</span>
<span class="s0">sat Kutuzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no</span>
<span class="s0">orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, do that,&quot; he replied to various proposals. &quot;Yes, yes: go,</span>
<span class="s0">dear boy, and have a look,&quot; he would say to one or another of those</span>
<span class="s0">about him; or, &quot;No, don't, we'd better wait!&quot; He listened to the</span>
<span class="s0">reports that were brought him and gave directions when his</span>
<span class="s0">subordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports</span>
<span class="s0">it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words</span>
<span class="s0">spoken, but rather in something else--in the expression of face and</span>
<span class="s0">tone of voice of those who were reporting. By long years of military</span>
<span class="s0">experience he knew, and with the wisdom of age understood, that it</span>
<span class="s0">is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others</span>
<span class="s0">struggling with death, and he knew that the result of a battle is</span>
<span class="s0">decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where</span>
<span class="s0">the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of</span>
<span class="s0">slaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the</span>
<span class="s0">army, and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in</span>
<span class="s0">his power.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov's general expression was one of concentrated quiet</span>
<span class="s0">attention, and his face wore a strained look as if he found it</span>
<span class="s0">difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body.</span>

<span class="s0">At eleven o'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by</span>
<span class="s0">the French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagration was wounded.</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov groaned and swayed his head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about it exactly,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of</span>
<span class="s0">Wurttemberg who was standing behind him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after the duke's departure--before he could possibly have</span>
<span class="s0">reached Semenovsk--his adjutant came back from him and told Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">that the duke asked for more troops.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take over</span>
<span class="s0">the command of the first army, and a request to the duke--whom he said</span>
<span class="s0">he could not spare at such an important moment--to return to him. When</span>
<span class="s0">they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the</span>
<span class="s0">staff officers congratulated him, Kutuzov smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wait a little, gentlemen,&quot; said he. &quot;The battle is won, and there</span>
<span class="s0">is nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is</span>
<span class="s0">better to wait before we rejoice.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.</span>

<span class="s0">When Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that</span>
<span class="s0">the French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk,</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov, guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin's</span>
<span class="s0">looks that the news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and,</span>
<span class="s0">taking Scherbinin's arm, led him aside.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go, my dear fellow,&quot; he said to Ermolov, &quot;and see whether something</span>
<span class="s0">can't be done.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov was in Gorki, near the center of the Russian position. The</span>
<span class="s0">attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several</span>
<span class="s0">times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino, and on their left flank Uvarov's cavalry had put the</span>
<span class="s0">French to flight.</span>

<span class="s0">Toward three o'clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of</span>
<span class="s0">all who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around</span>
<span class="s0">him, Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was</span>
<span class="s0">satisfied with the day's success--a success exceeding his</span>
<span class="s0">expectations, but the old man's strength was failing him. Several</span>
<span class="s0">times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off.</span>
<span class="s0">Dinner was brought him.</span>

<span class="s0">Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew had said, &quot;the war should be extended widely,&quot; and whom</span>
<span class="s0">Bagration so detested, rode up while Kutuzov was at dinner. Wolzogen</span>
<span class="s0">had come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on</span>
<span class="s0">the left flank. The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of</span>
<span class="s0">wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army,</span>
<span class="s0">weighed all the circumstances, concluded that the battle was lost, and</span>
<span class="s0">sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and</span>
<span class="s0">glanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering</span>
<span class="s0">lids.</span>

<span class="s0">Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak</span>
<span class="s0">of his cap.</span>

<span class="s0">He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected</span>
<span class="s0">nonchalance intended to show that, as a highly trained military man,</span>
<span class="s0">he left it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but</span>
<span class="s0">that he knew whom he was dealing with. &quot;Der alte Herr&quot; (as in their</span>
<span class="s0">own set the Germans called Kutuzov) &quot;is making himself very</span>
<span class="s0">comfortable,&quot; thought Wolzogen, and looking severely at the dishes</span>
<span class="s0">in front of Kutuzov he began to report to &quot;the old gentleman&quot; the</span>
<span class="s0">position of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to</span>
<span class="s0">and as he himself had seen and understood it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All the points of our position are in the enemy's hands and we</span>
<span class="s0">cannot dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away</span>
<span class="s0">and it is impossible to stop them,&quot; he reported.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen,</span>
<span class="s0">as if not understand what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing &quot;the old</span>
<span class="s0">gentleman's&quot; agitation, said with a smile:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness</span>
<span class="s0">what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have seen? You have seen?...&quot; Kutuzov shouted frowning, and</span>
<span class="s0">rising quickly he went up to Wolzogen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How... how dare you!...&quot; he shouted, choking and making a</span>
<span class="s0">threatening gesture with his trembling arms: &quot;How dare you, sir, say</span>
<span class="s0">that to me? You know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me</span>
<span class="s0">that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the</span>
<span class="s0">battle is better known to me, the commander in chief, than to him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutuzov interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right</span>
<span class="s0">flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say</span>
<span class="s0">what you don't know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and</span>
<span class="s0">inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov sternly.</span>

<span class="s0">All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy</span>
<span class="s0">breathing of the panting old general.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave</span>
<span class="s0">army! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the</span>
<span class="s0">sacred soil of Russia,&quot; said Kutuzov crossing himself, and he suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.</span>

<span class="s0">Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped</span>
<span class="s0">silently aside, marveling at &quot;the old gentleman's&quot; conceited</span>
<span class="s0">stupidity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, here he is, my hero!&quot; said Kutuzov to a portly, handsome,</span>
<span class="s0">dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.</span>

<span class="s0">This was Raevski, who had spent the whole day at the most</span>
<span class="s0">important part of the field of Borodino.</span>

<span class="s0">Raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground</span>
<span class="s0">and that the French no longer ventured to attack.</span>

<span class="s0">After hearing him, Kutuzov said in French:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is</span>
<span class="s0">always the most stubborn who remain victors,&quot; replied Raevski, &quot;and in</span>
<span class="s0">my opinion...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Kaysarov!&quot; Kutuzov called to his adjutant. &quot;Sit down and write</span>
<span class="s0">out the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,&quot; he continued,</span>
<span class="s0">addressing another, &quot;ride along the line and that tomorrow we attack.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">While Kutuzov was talking to Raevski and dictating the order of</span>
<span class="s0">the day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field</span>
<span class="s0">marshal had given.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the</span>
<span class="s0">order to be written out which the former commander in chief, to</span>
<span class="s0">avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.</span>

<span class="s0">And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains</span>
<span class="s0">throughout an army one and the same temper, known as &quot;the spirit of</span>
<span class="s0">the army,&quot; and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutuzov's words,</span>
<span class="s0">his order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end</span>
<span class="s0">of the army to the other.</span>

<span class="s0">It was far from being the same words or the same order that</span>
<span class="s0">reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth</span>
<span class="s0">to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because</span>
<span class="s0">what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a</span>
<span class="s0">feeling that lay in the commander in chief's soul as in that of</span>
<span class="s0">every Russian.</span>

<span class="s0">And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and</span>
<span class="s0">hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted</span>
<span class="s0">to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXVI</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's regiment was among the reserves which till after one</span>
<span class="s0">o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk, under heavy</span>
<span class="s0">artillery fire. Toward two o'clock the regiment, having already lost</span>
<span class="s0">more than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled</span>
<span class="s0">oatfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the Knoll Battery, where</span>
<span class="s0">thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense,</span>
<span class="s0">concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between</span>
<span class="s0">one and two o'clock.</span>

<span class="s0">Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment</span>
<span class="s0">here lost another third of its men. From in front and especially</span>
<span class="s0">from the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the</span>
<span class="s0">mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front,</span>
<span class="s0">quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly.</span>
<span class="s0">At times, as if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed</span>
<span class="s0">during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and</span>
<span class="s0">the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded</span>
<span class="s0">carried off.</span>

<span class="s0">With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those</span>
<span class="s0">not yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three</span>
<span class="s0">hundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and</span>
<span class="s0">the same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely</span>
<span class="s0">heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of</span>
<span class="s0">a successful shot and the cry of &quot;stretchers!&quot; was heard. Most of</span>
<span class="s0">the time, by their officers' order, the men sat on the ground. One,</span>
<span class="s0">having taken off his shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its</span>
<span class="s0">lining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry clay</span>
<span class="s0">between his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap</span>
<span class="s0">and pulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and</span>
<span class="s0">refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again. Some built little</span>
<span class="s0">houses of the tufts in the plowed ground, or plaited baskets from</span>
<span class="s0">the straw in the cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these</span>
<span class="s0">pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers</span>
<span class="s0">went past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses of the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to</span>
<span class="s0">these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of</span>
<span class="s0">our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were heard</span>
<span class="s0">on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences</span>
<span class="s0">quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if the</span>
<span class="s0">minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,</span>
<span class="s0">commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front</span>
<span class="s0">of the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a</span>
<span class="s0">trace. &quot;Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She'll</span>
<span class="s0">fall.... Ah, they don't see it!&quot; came identical shouts from the</span>
<span class="s0">ranks all along the regiment. Another time, general attention was</span>
<span class="s0">attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which</span>
<span class="s0">trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail</span>
<span class="s0">stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped,</span>
<span class="s0">tucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and</span>
<span class="s0">shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But such</span>
<span class="s0">distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had</span>
<span class="s0">been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale</span>
<span class="s0">and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment,</span>
<span class="s0">paced up and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge</span>
<span class="s0">of the meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind</span>
<span class="s0">his back. There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given.</span>
<span class="s0">Everything went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the</span>
<span class="s0">front, the wounded carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily. At</span>
<span class="s0">first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to rouse the courage of</span>
<span class="s0">the men and to set them an example, walked about among the ranks,</span>
<span class="s0">but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that</span>
<span class="s0">there was nothing he could teach them. All the powers of his soul,</span>
<span class="s0">as of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the</span>
<span class="s0">contemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the</span>
<span class="s0">meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the</span>
<span class="s0">dust that covered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to</span>
<span class="s0">the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his</span>
<span class="s0">steps, calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to</span>
<span class="s0">walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that</span>
<span class="s0">grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their</span>
<span class="s0">pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained of the previous</span>
<span class="s0">day's thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with weary ears</span>
<span class="s0">to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle of flying</span>
<span class="s0">projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely</span>
<span class="s0">familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited. &quot;Here it</span>
<span class="s0">comes... this one is coming our way again!&quot; he thought, listening to</span>
<span class="s0">an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. &quot;One, another!</span>
<span class="s0">Again! It has hit....&quot; He stopped and looked at the ranks. &quot;No, it has</span>
<span class="s0">gone over. But this one has hit!&quot; And again he started trying to reach</span>
<span class="s0">the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces</span>
<span class="s0">from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill</span>
<span class="s0">ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many had</span>
<span class="s0">been hit--a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Adjutant!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Order them not to crowd together.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look out!&quot; came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird</span>
<span class="s0">whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell</span>
<span class="s0">dropped with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and</span>
<span class="s0">close to the battalion commander's horse. The horse first,</span>
<span class="s0">regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear, snorted,</span>
<span class="s0">reared almost throwing the major, and galloped aside. The horse's</span>
<span class="s0">terror infected the men.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lie down!&quot; cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between</span>
<span class="s0">him and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the</span>
<span class="s0">field and the meadow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Can this be death?&quot; thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite</span>
<span class="s0">new, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of</span>
<span class="s0">smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball. &quot;I cannot, I do not</span>
<span class="s0">wish to die. I love life--I love this grass, this earth, this air....&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">He thought this, and at the same time remembered that people were</span>
<span class="s0">looking at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's shameful, sir!&quot; he said to the adjutant. &quot;What...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the</span>
<span class="s0">sound of an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking</span>
<span class="s0">window frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started</span>
<span class="s0">to one side, raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several</span>
<span class="s0">officers ran up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood</span>
<span class="s0">was welling out making a large stain on the grass.</span>

<span class="s0">The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the</span>
<span class="s0">officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,</span>
<span class="s0">breathing heavily and noisily.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you waiting for? Come along!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but</span>
<span class="s0">he moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pick him up, lift him, it's all the same!&quot; cried someone.</span>

<span class="s0">They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My</span>
<span class="s0">God!&quot;--voices among the officers were heard saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It flew a hair's breadth past my ear,&quot; said the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing</span>
<span class="s0">station.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!&quot; shouted an officer, seizing by</span>
<span class="s0">their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly</span>
<span class="s0">and jolting the stretcher.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Get into step, Fedor... I say, Fedor!&quot; said the foremost peasant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now that's right!&quot; said the one behind joyfully, when he had got</span>
<span class="s0">into step.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency! Eh, Prince!&quot; said the trembling voice of Timokhin,</span>
<span class="s0">who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from</span>
<span class="s0">the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his</span>
<span class="s0">eyelids drooped.</span>


<span class="s0">The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to dressing station by the</span>
<span class="s0">wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of</span>
<span class="s0">three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch</span>
<span class="s0">wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were</span>
<span class="s0">eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and</span>
<span class="s0">pecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among</span>
<span class="s0">the birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than</span>
<span class="s0">five acres, bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay.</span>
<span class="s0">Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with</span>
<span class="s0">dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in</span>
<span class="s0">vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers' orders, the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently,</span>
<span class="s0">as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking</span>
<span class="s0">place before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now</span>
<span class="s0">plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or</span>
<span class="s0">to point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men</span>
<span class="s0">awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed,</span>
<span class="s0">swore, or asked for vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew's</span>
<span class="s0">bearers, stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took</span>
<span class="s0">him, as a regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there</span>
<span class="s0">stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and</span>
<span class="s0">for a long time could not make out what was going on around him. He</span>
<span class="s0">remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black</span>
<span class="s0">ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps from</span>
<span class="s0">him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting</span>
<span class="s0">general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired</span>
<span class="s0">noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in</span>
<span class="s0">the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his</span>
<span class="s0">talk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we</span>
<span class="s0">grabbed the King himself!&quot; cried he, looking around him with eyes that</span>
<span class="s0">glittered with fever. &quot;If only reserves had come up just then, lads,</span>
<span class="s0">there wouldn't have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him</span>
<span class="s0">with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. &quot;But isn't it</span>
<span class="s0">all the same now?&quot; thought he. &quot;And what will be there, and what has</span>
<span class="s0">there been here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was</span>
<span class="s0">something in this life I did not and do not understand.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXVII</span>


<span class="s0">One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,</span>
<span class="s0">holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his</span>
<span class="s0">small bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head</span>
<span class="s0">and looked about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He</span>
<span class="s0">evidently wanted a little respite. After turning his head from right</span>
<span class="s0">to left for some time, he sighed and looked down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right, immediately,&quot; he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.</span>

<span class="s0">Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have</span>
<span class="s0">a chance!&quot; remarked one.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only</span>
<span class="s0">just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent. The</span>
<span class="s0">pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh,</span>
<span class="s0">stomach, and back distracted him. All he saw about him merged into a</span>
<span class="s0">general impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill</span>
<span class="s0">the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks previously, on that hot</span>
<span class="s0">August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same chair a canon, the</span>
<span class="s0">sight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a</span>
<span class="s0">presentiment.</span>

<span class="s0">There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied,</span>
<span class="s0">and on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he</span>
<span class="s0">was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on</span>
<span class="s0">the other two tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a</span>
<span class="s0">Cossack, judging by the uniform thrown down beside him. Four</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was cutting into</span>
<span class="s0">his muscular brown back.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ooh, ooh, ooh!&quot; grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his</span>
<span class="s0">swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white</span>
<span class="s0">teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing,</span>
<span class="s0">ringing, and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many</span>
<span class="s0">people were crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his</span>
<span class="s0">head thrown back. His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head</span>
<span class="s0">seemed strangely familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were</span>
<span class="s0">pressing on his chest to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg</span>
<span class="s0">twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor. The man was</span>
<span class="s0">sobbing and choking convulsively. Two doctors--one of whom was pale</span>
<span class="s0">and trembling--were silently doing something to this man's other, gory</span>
<span class="s0">leg. When he had finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an</span>
<span class="s0">overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his</span>
<span class="s0">hands.</span>

<span class="s0">He glanced at Prince Andrew's face and quickly turned away.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Undress him! What are you waiting for?&quot; he cried angrily to the</span>
<span class="s0">dressers.</span>

<span class="s0">His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began</span>
<span class="s0">hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The</span>
<span class="s0">doctor bent down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he</span>
<span class="s0">made a sign to someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew to lose consciousness. When he came to himself the</span>
<span class="s0">splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted, the torn</span>
<span class="s0">flesh cut away, and the wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on</span>
<span class="s0">his face. As soon as Prince Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent</span>
<span class="s0">over, kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away.</span>

<span class="s0">After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a</span>
<span class="s0">blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All</span>
<span class="s0">the best and happiest moments of his life--especially his earliest</span>
<span class="s0">childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when</span>
<span class="s0">leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his</span>
<span class="s0">head in the pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life-</span>
<span class="s0">returned to his memory, not merely as something past but as</span>
<span class="s0">something present.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of</span>
<span class="s0">whose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him</span>
<span class="s0">up and trying to quiet him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!&quot; his frightened moans</span>
<span class="s0">could be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep.</span>
<span class="s0">Whether because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to</span>
<span class="s0">part with life, or because of those memories of a childhood that could</span>
<span class="s0">not return, or because he was suffering and others were suffering</span>
<span class="s0">and that man near him was groaning so piteously--he felt like</span>
<span class="s0">weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears.</span>

<span class="s0">The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted</span>
<span class="s0">blood and with the boot still on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh! Oh, ooh!&quot; he sobbed, like a woman.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew from seeing his face, moved away.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My God! What is this? Why is he here?&quot; said Prince Andrew to</span>
<span class="s0">himself.</span>

<span class="s0">In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been</span>
<span class="s0">amputated, he recognized Anatole Kuragin. Men were supporting him in</span>
<span class="s0">their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling,</span>
<span class="s0">swollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully</span>
<span class="s0">connected with me,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping</span>
<span class="s0">what he saw before him. &quot;What is the connection of that man with my</span>
<span class="s0">childhood and life?&quot; he asked himself without finding an answer. And</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving</span>
<span class="s0">childhood presented itself to him. He remembered Natasha as he had</span>
<span class="s0">seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810, with her slender neck</span>
<span class="s0">and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture, and</span>
<span class="s0">love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever,</span>
<span class="s0">awoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed</span>
<span class="s0">between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears</span>
<span class="s0">that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic</span>
<span class="s0">pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender</span>
<span class="s0">loving tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and</span>
<span class="s0">their errors.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for</span>
<span class="s0">those who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God</span>
<span class="s0">preached on earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not</span>
<span class="s0">understand--that is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what</span>
<span class="s0">remained for me had I lived. But now it is too late. I know it!&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXVIII</span>


<span class="s0">The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and</span>
<span class="s0">wounded, together with the heaviness of his head and the news that</span>
<span class="s0">some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded,</span>
<span class="s0">and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm,</span>
<span class="s0">produced an unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to</span>
<span class="s0">look at the killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his</span>
<span class="s0">strength of mind. This day the horrible appearance of the</span>
<span class="s0">battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought</span>
<span class="s0">constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from the</span>
<span class="s0">battlefield and returned to the Shevardino knoll, where he sat on</span>
<span class="s0">his campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his</span>
<span class="s0">nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the</span>
<span class="s0">end of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant</span>
<span class="s0">and which he was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a</span>
<span class="s0">brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he</span>
<span class="s0">had served so long. He felt in his own person the sufferings and death</span>
<span class="s0">he had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and</span>
<span class="s0">chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for</span>
<span class="s0">himself. At that moment he did not desire Moscow, or victory, or glory</span>
<span class="s0">(what need had he for any more glory?). The one thing he wished for</span>
<span class="s0">was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he had been on the</span>
<span class="s0">Semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring</span>
<span class="s0">several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the</span>
<span class="s0">fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo. Napoleon had</span>
<span class="s0">assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of</span>
<span class="s0">the effect those batteries produced.</span>

<span class="s0">An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns</span>
<span class="s0">had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that</span>
<span class="s0">they still held their ground.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They want more!...&quot; said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire?&quot; asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They want more!&quot; croaked Napoleon frowning. &quot;Let them have it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and</span>
<span class="s0">for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of</span>
<span class="s0">him, was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of</span>
<span class="s0">imaginary greatness, and again--as a horse walking a treadmill</span>
<span class="s0">thinks it is doing something for itself--he submissively fulfilled the</span>
<span class="s0">cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.</span>

<span class="s0">And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience</span>
<span class="s0">darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening</span>
<span class="s0">lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the</span>
<span class="s0">end of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the</span>
<span class="s0">significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and</span>
<span class="s0">truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to</span>
<span class="s0">grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as</span>
<span class="s0">they were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth,</span>
<span class="s0">goodness, and all humanity.</span>

<span class="s0">Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with</span>
<span class="s0">men killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as</span>
<span class="s0">he looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,</span>
<span class="s0">deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that</span>
<span class="s0">there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone</span>
<span class="s0">did he write in a letter to Paris that &quot;the battle field was</span>
<span class="s0">superb,&quot; because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the</span>
<span class="s0">island of St. Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he</span>
<span class="s0">intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had</span>
<span class="s0">done, he wrote:</span>


<span class="s0">The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern</span>
<span class="s0">times: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the</span>
<span class="s0">tranquillity and security of all; it was purely pacific and</span>
<span class="s0">conservative.</span>

<span class="s0">It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the</span>
<span class="s0">beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening</span>
<span class="s0">out, full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system</span>
<span class="s0">was already founded; all that remained was to organize it.</span>

<span class="s0">Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I</span>
<span class="s0">too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were</span>
<span class="s0">stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have</span>
<span class="s0">discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account</span>
<span class="s0">to the peoples as clerk to master.</span>

<span class="s0">Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people,</span>
<span class="s0">and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in</span>
<span class="s0">the common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all</span>
<span class="s0">navigable rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all,</span>
<span class="s0">and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to</span>
<span class="s0">mere guards for the sovereigns.</span>

<span class="s0">On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong,</span>
<span class="s0">magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have</span>
<span class="s0">proclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely</span>
<span class="s0">defensive, all aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated</span>
<span class="s0">my son in the Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and</span>
<span class="s0">his constitutional reign would have begun.</span>

<span class="s0">Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the</span>
<span class="s0">envy of the nations!</span>

<span class="s0">My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company</span>
<span class="s0">with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to</span>
<span class="s0">leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country</span>
<span class="s0">couple, every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing</span>
<span class="s0">wrongs, and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all</span>
<span class="s0">sides and everywhere.</span>


<span class="s0">Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of</span>
<span class="s0">executioner of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his</span>
<span class="s0">actions had been the peoples' welfare and that he could control the</span>
<span class="s0">fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,&quot; he wrote further</span>
<span class="s0">of the Russian war, &quot;half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,</span>
<span class="s0">Bavarians, Wurttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and</span>
<span class="s0">Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third</span>
<span class="s0">composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,</span>
<span class="s0">Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the</span>
<span class="s0">Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on:</span>
<span class="s0">it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French.</span>
<span class="s0">The Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand</span>
<span class="s0">men; the Russian army in its retreat from Vilna to Moscow lost in</span>
<span class="s0">the various battles four times more men than the French army; the</span>
<span class="s0">burning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who</span>
<span class="s0">died of cold and want in the woods; finally, in its march from</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow to the Oder the Russian army also suffered from the severity of</span>
<span class="s0">the season; so that by the the time it reached Vilna it numbered</span>
<span class="s0">only fifty thousand, and at Kalisch less than eighteen thousand.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the</span>
<span class="s0">horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the</span>
<span class="s0">whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found</span>
<span class="s0">justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who</span>
<span class="s0">perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXIX</span>


<span class="s0">Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and</span>
<span class="s0">various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Davydov</span>
<span class="s0">family and to the crown serfs--those fields and meadows where for</span>
<span class="s0">hundreds of years the peasants of Borodino, Gorki, Shevardino, and</span>
<span class="s0">Semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At</span>
<span class="s0">the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a</span>
<span class="s0">space of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms,</span>
<span class="s0">wounded and unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves</span>
<span class="s0">back to Mozhaysk from the one army and back to Valuevo from the other.</span>
<span class="s0">Other crowds, exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their</span>
<span class="s0">officers. Others held their ground and continued to fire.</span>

<span class="s0">Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter</span>
<span class="s0">of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now</span>
<span class="s0">spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of</span>
<span class="s0">saltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall</span>
<span class="s0">on the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, and</span>
<span class="s0">hesitating men, as if to say: &quot;Enough, men! Enough! Cease... bethink</span>
<span class="s0">yourselves! What are you doing?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,</span>
<span class="s0">it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to</span>
<span class="s0">slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the</span>
<span class="s0">question arose in every soul: &quot;For what, for whom, must I kill and</span>
<span class="s0">be killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don't want to</span>
<span class="s0">do so anymore!&quot; By evening this thought had ripened in every soul.</span>
<span class="s0">At any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what</span>
<span class="s0">they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away</span>
<span class="s0">anywhere.</span>

<span class="s0">But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the</span>
<span class="s0">horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to</span>
<span class="s0">leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to</span>
<span class="s0">control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed,</span>
<span class="s0">and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of</span>
<span class="s0">every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue,</span>
<span class="s0">perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls flew</span>
<span class="s0">just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies,</span>
<span class="s0">and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but</span>
<span class="s0">at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.</span>

<span class="s0">Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would</span>
<span class="s0">have said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it</span>
<span class="s0">would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army</span>
<span class="s0">would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight</span>
<span class="s0">effort and the French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor</span>
<span class="s0">the Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly</span>
<span class="s0">out.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russians did not make that effort because they were not</span>
<span class="s0">attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood</span>
<span class="s0">blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the</span>
<span class="s0">battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians</span>
<span class="s0">been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have</span>
<span class="s0">made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken</span>
<span class="s0">up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the</span>
<span class="s0">battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE</span>
<span class="s0">HALF of their army.</span>

<span class="s0">The French, with the memory of all their former victories during</span>
<span class="s0">fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon's invincibility, with</span>
<span class="s0">the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and</span>
<span class="s0">had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards</span>
<span class="s0">intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort.</span>
<span class="s0">The French had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its</span>
<span class="s0">position ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians</span>
<span class="s0">continued to block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French</span>
<span class="s0">had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain.</span>
<span class="s0">But the French did not make that effort. Some historians say that</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon need only have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and</span>
<span class="s0">the battle would have been won. To speak of what would have happened</span>
<span class="s0">had Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of what would happen if</span>
<span class="s0">autumn became spring. It could not be. Napoleon did not give his</span>
<span class="s0">Guards, not because he did not want to, but because it could not be</span>
<span class="s0">done. All the generals, officers, and soldiers of the French army knew</span>
<span class="s0">it could not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops</span>
<span class="s0">would not permit it.</span>

<span class="s0">It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling</span>
<span class="s0">of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,</span>
<span class="s0">after all their experience of previous battles--when after one tenth</span>
<span class="s0">of such efforts the enemy had fled--experienced a similar feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">terror before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as</span>
<span class="s0">threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The</span>
<span class="s0">moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted. Not that</span>
<span class="s0">sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of</span>
<span class="s0">material fastened to sticks, called standards, and of the ground on</span>
<span class="s0">which the troops had stood and were standing, but a moral victory that</span>
<span class="s0">convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of</span>
<span class="s0">his own impotence was gained by the Russians at Borodino. The French</span>
<span class="s0">invaders, like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received</span>
<span class="s0">a mortal wound, felt that they were perishing, but could not stop, any</span>
<span class="s0">more than the Russian army, weaker by one half, could help swerving.</span>
<span class="s0">By impetus gained, the French army was still able to roll forward to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, but there, without further effort on the part of the Russians,</span>
<span class="s0">it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred</span>
<span class="s0">thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit</span>
<span class="s0">had been laid.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK ELEVEN: 1812</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human</span>
<span class="s0">mind. Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only</span>
<span class="s0">when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but</span>
<span class="s0">at the same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the</span>
<span class="s0">arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements.</span>
<span class="s0">There is a well known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in</span>
<span class="s0">this, that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was</span>
<span class="s0">following, in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast</span>
<span class="s0">as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the distance that</span>
<span class="s0">separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of</span>
<span class="s0">that distance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth,</span>
<span class="s0">the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so on forever.</span>
<span class="s0">This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that</span>
<span class="s0">Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that</span>
<span class="s0">motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements, whereas</span>
<span class="s0">the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.</span>

<span class="s0">By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only</span>
<span class="s0">approach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we</span>
<span class="s0">have admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the</span>
<span class="s0">resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth,</span>
<span class="s0">and have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we reach</span>
<span class="s0">a solution of the problem.</span>

<span class="s0">A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing</span>
<span class="s0">with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more</span>
<span class="s0">complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.</span>

<span class="s0">This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when</span>
<span class="s0">dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the</span>
<span class="s0">infinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion</span>
<span class="s0">(absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error</span>
<span class="s0">which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements</span>
<span class="s0">of motion instead of examining continuous motion.</span>

<span class="s0">In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing</span>
<span class="s0">happens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable</span>
<span class="s0">arbitrary human wills, is continuous.</span>

<span class="s0">To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of</span>
<span class="s0">history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all</span>
<span class="s0">those human wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected</span>
<span class="s0">units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily</span>
<span class="s0">selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others,</span>
<span class="s0">though there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event</span>
<span class="s0">always flows uninterruptedly from another.</span>

<span class="s0">The second method is to consider the actions of some one man--a king</span>
<span class="s0">or a commander--as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills;</span>
<span class="s0">whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity</span>
<span class="s0">of a single historic personage.</span>

<span class="s0">Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth</span>
<span class="s0">continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But</span>
<span class="s0">however small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit</span>
<span class="s0">disconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any</span>
<span class="s0">phenomenon, or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the</span>
<span class="s0">actions of any one historic personage, is in itself false.</span>

<span class="s0">It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any</span>
<span class="s0">deductions drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some</span>
<span class="s0">larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation--as criticism has</span>
<span class="s0">every right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must</span>
<span class="s0">always be arbitrarily selected.</span>

<span class="s0">Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the</span>
<span class="s0">differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men)</span>
<span class="s0">and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum</span>
<span class="s0">of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.</span>

<span class="s0">The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe</span>
<span class="s0">present an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave</span>
<span class="s0">their customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other,</span>
<span class="s0">plunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair,</span>
<span class="s0">and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an</span>
<span class="s0">intensive movement which first increases and then slackens. What was</span>
<span class="s0">the cause of this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the</span>
<span class="s0">mind of man.</span>

<span class="s0">The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings</span>
<span class="s0">and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris,</span>
<span class="s0">calling these sayings and doings &quot;the Revolution&quot;; then they give a</span>
<span class="s0">detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or</span>
<span class="s0">hostile to him; tell of the influence some of these people had on</span>
<span class="s0">others, and say: that is why this movement took place and those are</span>
<span class="s0">its laws.</span>

<span class="s0">But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation,</span>
<span class="s0">but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious,</span>
<span class="s0">because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger.</span>
<span class="s0">The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and</span>
<span class="s0">only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But every time there have been conquests there have been</span>
<span class="s0">conquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any state</span>
<span class="s0">there have been great men,&quot; says history. And, indeed, human reason</span>
<span class="s0">replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this</span>
<span class="s0">does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is</span>
<span class="s0">possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a</span>
<span class="s0">single man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten,</span>
<span class="s0">I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells</span>
<span class="s0">begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right</span>
<span class="s0">to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position</span>
<span class="s0">of the hands of the watch.</span>

<span class="s0">Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and</span>
<span class="s0">see the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to</span>
<span class="s0">conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of</span>
<span class="s0">the movement of the engine.</span>

<span class="s0">The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the</span>
<span class="s0">oaks are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when</span>
<span class="s0">the oak is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold</span>
<span class="s0">winds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the</span>
<span class="s0">peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold</span>
<span class="s0">wind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I</span>
<span class="s0">see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the</span>
<span class="s0">phenomena of life, and I see that however much and however carefully I</span>
<span class="s0">observe the hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the</span>
<span class="s0">engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells</span>
<span class="s0">ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I</span>
<span class="s0">must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the</span>
<span class="s0">movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do</span>
<span class="s0">the same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.</span>

<span class="s0">To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject</span>
<span class="s0">of our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals,</span>
<span class="s0">and the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are</span>
<span class="s0">moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance</span>
<span class="s0">in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it</span>
<span class="s0">is evident that only along that path does the possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">discovering the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth</span>
<span class="s0">part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by</span>
<span class="s0">historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various</span>
<span class="s0">kings, commanders, and ministers and propounding the historians' own</span>
<span class="s0">reflections concerning these actions.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The</span>
<span class="s0">Russian army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk was reached,</span>
<span class="s0">and again from Smolensk to Borodino. The French army pushed on to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, its goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim,</span>
<span class="s0">just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches</span>
<span class="s0">the earth. Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken,</span>
<span class="s0">hostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its</span>
<span class="s0">goal. Every soldier in Napoleon's army felt this and the invasion</span>
<span class="s0">moved on by its own momentum.</span>

<span class="s0">The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of</span>
<span class="s0">hatred of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army</span>
<span class="s0">increased and consolidated. At Borodino a collision took place.</span>
<span class="s0">Neither army was broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately</span>
<span class="s0">after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding</span>
<span class="s0">with another having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability</span>
<span class="s0">the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on</span>
<span class="s0">for some distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its</span>
<span class="s0">force.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russians retreated eighty miles--to beyond Moscow--and the</span>
<span class="s0">French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks</span>
<span class="s0">after that there was not a single battle. The French did not move.</span>
<span class="s0">As a bleeding, mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained</span>
<span class="s0">inert in Moscow for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh</span>
<span class="s0">reason, fled back: they made a dash for the Kaluga road, and (after</span>
<span class="s0">a victory--for at Malo-Yaroslavets the field of conflict again</span>
<span class="s0">remained theirs) without undertaking a single serious battle, they</span>
<span class="s0">fled still more rapidly back to Smolensk, beyond Smolensk, beyond</span>
<span class="s0">the Berezina, beyond Vilna, and farther still.</span>

<span class="s0">On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutuzov and the</span>
<span class="s0">whole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino was a</span>
<span class="s0">victory. Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare</span>
<span class="s0">for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive</span>
<span class="s0">anyone, but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who</span>
<span class="s0">had taken part in the battle knew it.</span>

<span class="s0">But all that evening and next day reports came in one after</span>
<span class="s0">another of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a</span>
<span class="s0">fresh battle proved physically impossible.</span>

<span class="s0">It was impossible to give battle before information had been</span>
<span class="s0">collected, the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition</span>
<span class="s0">replenished, the slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to</span>
<span class="s0">replace those who had been killed, and before the men had had food and</span>
<span class="s0">sleep. And meanwhile, the very next morning after the battle, the</span>
<span class="s0">French army advanced of itself upon the Russians, carried forward by</span>
<span class="s0">the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse</span>
<span class="s0">proportion to the square of the distance from its aim. Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">wish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired to do so.</span>
<span class="s0">But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there</span>
<span class="s0">must also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not</span>
<span class="s0">exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day's march, and then in the</span>
<span class="s0">same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day's</span>
<span class="s0">march, and at last, on the first of September when the army drew</span>
<span class="s0">near Moscow--despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in</span>
<span class="s0">all ranks--the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day's march, and</span>
<span class="s0">abandoned Moscow to the enemy.</span>

<span class="s0">For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles</span>
<span class="s0">are made by generals--as any one of us sitting over a map in his study</span>
<span class="s0">may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that</span>
<span class="s0">battle--the questions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov during the</span>
<span class="s0">retreat not do this or that? Why did he not take up a position</span>
<span class="s0">before reaching Fili? Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga</span>
<span class="s0">road, abandoning Moscow? and so on. People accustomed to think in that</span>
<span class="s0">way forget, or do not know, the inevitable conditions which always</span>
<span class="s0">limit the activities of any commander in chief. The activity of a</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief does not all resemble the activity we imagine to</span>
<span class="s0">ourselves when we sit at case in our studies examining some campaign</span>
<span class="s0">on the map, with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a</span>
<span class="s0">certain known locality, and begin our plans from some given moment.</span>
<span class="s0">A commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event-</span>
<span class="s0">the position from which we always contemplate it. The commander in</span>
<span class="s0">chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so</span>
<span class="s0">he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event</span>
<span class="s0">that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping</span>
<span class="s0">itself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted</span>
<span class="s0">shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most</span>
<span class="s0">complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities,</span>
<span class="s0">projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged</span>
<span class="s0">to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly</span>
<span class="s0">conflict with one another.</span>

<span class="s0">Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">should have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before reaching</span>
<span class="s0">Fili, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But</span>
<span class="s0">a commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always</span>
<span class="s0">before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these</span>
<span class="s0">proposals, based on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.</span>

<span class="s0">A commander in chief's business, it would seem, is simply to</span>
<span class="s0">choose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and</span>
<span class="s0">time do not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested</span>
<span class="s0">to him to cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an adjutant</span>
<span class="s0">gallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French</span>
<span class="s0">or retire. An order must be given him at once, that instant. And the</span>
<span class="s0">order to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kaluga road. And</span>
<span class="s0">after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the</span>
<span class="s0">stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where</span>
<span class="s0">the wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter</span>
<span class="s0">from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">abandoning Moscow, and the commander in chief's rival, the man who</span>
<span class="s0">is undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several</span>
<span class="s0">such), presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning</span>
<span class="s0">to the Kaluga road, and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and</span>
<span class="s0">refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has</span>
<span class="s0">been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain,</span>
<span class="s0">and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an</span>
<span class="s0">officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a</span>
<span class="s0">prisoner, and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe</span>
<span class="s0">the position of the enemy's army differently. People accustomed to</span>
<span class="s0">misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief's actions describe to us, for instance, the</span>
<span class="s0">position of the army at Fili and assume that the commander in chief</span>
<span class="s0">could, on the first of September, quite freely decide whether to</span>
<span class="s0">abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less</span>
<span class="s0">than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that</span>
<span class="s0">question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolensk and most palpably</span>
<span class="s0">of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevardino and on the</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-sixth at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of the</span>
<span class="s0">retreat from Borodino to Fili.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">When Ermolov, having been sent by Kutuzov to inspect the position,</span>
<span class="s0">told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and that they must retreat, Kutuzov looked at him in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give me your hand,&quot; said he and, turning it over so as to feel</span>
<span class="s0">the pulse, added: &quot;You are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you</span>
<span class="s0">are saying!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow without a battle.</span>

<span class="s0">On the Poklonny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomilov gate of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, Kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the</span>
<span class="s0">roadside. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin, who had come out from Moscow, joined them. This</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed</span>
<span class="s0">the advantages and disadvantages of the position, the state of the</span>
<span class="s0">army, the plans suggested, the situation of Moscow, and military</span>
<span class="s0">questions generally. Though they had not been summoned for the</span>
<span class="s0">purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this</span>
<span class="s0">was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public</span>
<span class="s0">questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a</span>
<span class="s0">whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or</span>
<span class="s0">laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They</span>
<span class="s0">evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the</span>
<span class="s0">situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among</span>
<span class="s0">themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench</span>
<span class="s0">formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might</span>
<span class="s0">overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being</span>
<span class="s0">said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not</span>
<span class="s0">himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After</span>
<span class="s0">hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he</span>
<span class="s0">generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they</span>
<span class="s0">were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the</span>
<span class="s0">position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself</span>
<span class="s0">so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others</span>
<span class="s0">argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should</span>
<span class="s0">have been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle</span>
<span class="s0">of Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman in a Spanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one of the</span>
<span class="s0">German princes serving with the Russian army were discussing the siege</span>
<span class="s0">of Saragossa and considering the possibility of defending Moscow in</span>
<span class="s0">a similar manner.) Count Rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he</span>
<span class="s0">was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the</span>
<span class="s0">capital, but that he still could not help regretting having been</span>
<span class="s0">left in ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it</span>
<span class="s0">sooner things would have been different.... A fifth group,</span>
<span class="s0">displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed</span>
<span class="s0">the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group was</span>
<span class="s0">talking absolute nonsense. Kutuzov's expression grew more and more</span>
<span class="s0">preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that</span>
<span class="s0">to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of</span>
<span class="s0">those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any</span>
<span class="s0">senseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would</span>
<span class="s0">result but the battle would still not take place. It would not take</span>
<span class="s0">place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to</span>
<span class="s0">be impossible, but in their conversations were only discussing what</span>
<span class="s0">would happen after its inevitable abandonment. How could the</span>
<span class="s0">commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to hold? The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">(who too reason) also considered the position impossible and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">could not go to fight, fully convinced as they were of defeat. If</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still</span>
<span class="s0">discussed it, the question was no longer important in itself but</span>
<span class="s0">only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This Kutuzov knew well.</span>

<span class="s0">Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian</span>
<span class="s0">patriotism (Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing) by</span>
<span class="s0">insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as</span>
<span class="s0">daylight to Kutuzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without</span>
<span class="s0">giving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if</span>
<span class="s0">battle were not given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man's mind. One</span>
<span class="s0">terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no</span>
<span class="s0">reply from anyone. The question for him now was: &quot;Have I really</span>
<span class="s0">allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it</span>
<span class="s0">decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Platov to</span>
<span class="s0">retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when</span>
<span class="s0">was this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army</span>
<span class="s0">must retreat and the order to do so must be given.&quot; To give that</span>
<span class="s0">terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of</span>
<span class="s0">the army. And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed</span>
<span class="s0">(the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovski, under whom he had served</span>
<span class="s0">in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to</span>
<span class="s0">save Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor's wish and by</span>
<span class="s0">the will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief. He</span>
<span class="s0">was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in</span>
<span class="s0">these difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he alone</span>
<span class="s0">could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and he was</span>
<span class="s0">horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something</span>
<span class="s0">had to be decided, and these conversations around him which were</span>
<span class="s0">assuming too free a character must be stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">He called the most important generals to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,&quot; said he, rising</span>
<span class="s0">from the bench, and he rode to Fili where his carriages were waiting.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in</span>
<span class="s0">the better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyanov's hut. The men,</span>
<span class="s0">women, and children of the large peasant family crowded into the</span>
<span class="s0">back room across the passage. Only Malasha, Andrew's six-year-old</span>
<span class="s0">granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had</span>
<span class="s0">given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea, remained on the top of</span>
<span class="s0">the brick oven in the larger room. Malasha looked down from the oven</span>
<span class="s0">with shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and decorations of the</span>
<span class="s0">generals, who one after another came into the room and sat down on the</span>
<span class="s0">broad benches in the corner under the icons. &quot;Granddad&quot; himself, as</span>
<span class="s0">Malasha in her own mind called Kutuzov, sat apart in a dark corner</span>
<span class="s0">behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and</span>
<span class="s0">continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat</span>
<span class="s0">which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those</span>
<span class="s0">who entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the</span>
<span class="s0">hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kaysarov was about to</span>
<span class="s0">draw back the curtain of the window facing Kutuzov, but the latter</span>
<span class="s0">moved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood that his Serene</span>
<span class="s0">Highness did not wish his face to be seen.</span>

<span class="s0">Round the peasant's deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils,</span>
<span class="s0">and papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in</span>
<span class="s0">another bench and put it beside the table. Ermolov, Kaysarov, and</span>
<span class="s0">Toll, who had just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost</span>
<span class="s0">place, immediately under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high</span>
<span class="s0">forehead merging into his bald crown. He had a St. George's Cross</span>
<span class="s0">round his neck and looked pale and ill. He had been feverish for two</span>
<span class="s0">days and was now shivering and in pain. Beside him sat Uvarov, who</span>
<span class="s0">with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information, speaking in</span>
<span class="s0">low tones as they all did. Chubby little Dokhturov was listening</span>
<span class="s0">attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach. On</span>
<span class="s0">the other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolstoy, seemingly absorbed in</span>
<span class="s0">his own thoughts. His broad head with its bold features and glittering</span>
<span class="s0">eyes was resting on his hand. Raevski, twitching forward the black</span>
<span class="s0">hair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kutuzov and now</span>
<span class="s0">at the door with a look of impatience. Konovnitsyn's firm, handsome,</span>
<span class="s0">and kindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met</span>
<span class="s0">Malasha's, and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to</span>
<span class="s0">smile.</span>

<span class="s0">They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of</span>
<span class="s0">inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited</span>
<span class="s0">for him from four till six o'clock and did not begin their</span>
<span class="s0">deliberations all that time talked in low tones of other matters.</span>

<span class="s0">Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutuzov leave his corner</span>
<span class="s0">and draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that</span>
<span class="s0">had been placed there to light up his face.</span>

<span class="s0">Bennigsen opened the council with the question: &quot;Are we to abandon</span>
<span class="s0">Russia's ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to</span>
<span class="s0">defend it?&quot; A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a</span>
<span class="s0">frown on every face and only Kutuzov's angry grunts and occasional</span>
<span class="s0">cough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malasha too</span>
<span class="s0">looked at &quot;Granddad.&quot; She was nearest to him and saw how his face</span>
<span class="s0">puckered; he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Russia's ancient and sacred capital!&quot; he suddenly said, repeating</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen's words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to</span>
<span class="s0">the false note in them. &quot;Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that</span>
<span class="s0">that question has no meaning for a Russian.&quot; (He lurched his heavy</span>
<span class="s0">body forward.) &quot;Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The</span>
<span class="s0">question I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military</span>
<span class="s0">one. The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the</span>
<span class="s0">army as well as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your</span>
<span class="s0">opinion,&quot; and he sank back in his chair.</span>

<span class="s0">The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game</span>
<span class="s0">lost. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle</span>
<span class="s0">at Fili was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the</span>
<span class="s0">love of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the</span>
<span class="s0">left flank during the night and attack the French right flank the</span>
<span class="s0">following day. Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced</span>
<span class="s0">for and against that project. Ermolov, Dokhturov, and Raevski agreed</span>
<span class="s0">with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">before abandoning the capital or guided by other, personal</span>
<span class="s0">considerations, these generals seemed not to understand that this</span>
<span class="s0">council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, however,</span>
<span class="s0">understood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, of the</span>
<span class="s0">direction the army should take in its retreat. Malasha, who kept her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes fixed on what was going on before her, understood the meaning</span>
<span class="s0">of the council differently. It seemed to her that it was only a</span>
<span class="s0">personal struggle between &quot;Granddad&quot; and &quot;Long-coat&quot; as she termed</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one</span>
<span class="s0">another, and in her heart she sided with &quot;Granddad.&quot; In the midst of</span>
<span class="s0">the conversation she noticed &quot;Granddad&quot; give Bennigsen a quick, subtle</span>
<span class="s0">glance, and then to her joys he saw that &quot;Granddad&quot; said something</span>
<span class="s0">to &quot;Long-coat&quot; which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and</span>
<span class="s0">paced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen's</span>
<span class="s0">proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to</span>
<span class="s0">attack the French right wing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Kutuzov, &quot;I cannot approve of the count's plan.</span>
<span class="s0">Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous,</span>
<span class="s0">and military history supports that view. For instance...&quot; Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear,</span>
<span class="s0">naive look at Bennigsen he added: &quot;Oh yes; take the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Friedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was...</span>
<span class="s0">not fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near</span>
<span class="s0">the enemy...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them</span>
<span class="s0">all.</span>

<span class="s0">The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and</span>
<span class="s0">they all felt that there was no more to be said.</span>

<span class="s0">During one of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if</span>
<span class="s0">preparing to speak. They all looked at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the</span>
<span class="s0">broken crockery,&quot; said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Gentlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with</span>
<span class="s0">me. But I,&quot; he paused, &quot;by the authority entrusted to me by my</span>
<span class="s0">Sovereign and country, order a retreat.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and</span>
<span class="s0">circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.</span>

<span class="s0">Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different</span>
<span class="s0">from the way they had spoken during the council, communicated</span>
<span class="s0">something to their commander in chief.</span>

<span class="s0">Malasha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully</span>
<span class="s0">backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its</span>
<span class="s0">projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she</span>
<span class="s0">darted out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">When he had dismissed the generals Kutuzov sat a long time with</span>
<span class="s0">his elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible</span>
<span class="s0">question: &quot;When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable?</span>
<span class="s0">When was that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame</span>
<span class="s0">for it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I did not expect this,&quot; said he to his adjutant Schneider when</span>
<span class="s0">the latter came in late that night. &quot;I did not expect this! I did</span>
<span class="s0">not think this would happen.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You should take some rest, your Serene Highness,&quot; replied</span>
<span class="s0">Schneider.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!&quot; exclaimed</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;They shall too, if only...&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">At that very time, in circumstances even more important than</span>
<span class="s0">retreating without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, Rostopchin, who is usually represented as being the instigator</span>
<span class="s0">of that event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">After the battle of Borodino the abandonment and burning of Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without</span>
<span class="s0">fighting.</span>

<span class="s0">Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the</span>
<span class="s0">feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.</span>

<span class="s0">The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the</span>
<span class="s0">towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolensk, without</span>
<span class="s0">the participation of Count Rostopchin and his broadsheets. The</span>
<span class="s0">people awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited</span>
<span class="s0">or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the</span>
<span class="s0">strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment.</span>
<span class="s0">And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away</span>
<span class="s0">abandoning their property, while the poorer remained and burned and</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed what was left.</span>

<span class="s0">The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was</span>
<span class="s0">and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of</span>
<span class="s0">this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in</span>
<span class="s0">Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already</span>
<span class="s0">in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this.</span>
<span class="s0">Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their</span>
<span class="s0">houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism</span>
<span class="s0">which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one's children to</span>
<span class="s0">save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively,</span>
<span class="s0">simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the</span>
<span class="s0">most powerful results.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running</span>
<span class="s0">away from Moscow,&quot; they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchin</span>
<span class="s0">impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed</span>
<span class="s0">to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing</span>
<span class="s0">it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had</span>
<span class="s0">committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the</span>
<span class="s0">rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had</span>
<span class="s0">remained intact and that during Napoleon's occupation the</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the</span>
<span class="s0">charming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">ladies, then liked so much.</span>

<span class="s0">They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to</span>
<span class="s0">whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It</span>
<span class="s0">was out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst</span>
<span class="s0">thing that could happen. They went away even before the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino and still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchin's calls</span>
<span class="s0">to defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the</span>
<span class="s0">wonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or</span>
<span class="s0">of the balloons that were to destroy the French, and despite all the</span>
<span class="s0">nonsense Rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets. They knew that it was</span>
<span class="s0">for the army to fight, and that if it could not succeed it would not</span>
<span class="s0">do to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter</span>
<span class="s0">of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that they must go away, sorry as they</span>
<span class="s0">were to abandon their property to destruction. They went away</span>
<span class="s0">without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and</span>
<span class="s0">wealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with</span>
<span class="s0">wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be</span>
<span class="s0">burned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was only in</span>
<span class="s0">consequence of their going away that the momentous event was</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">people. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchin's</span>
<span class="s0">orders, had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women</span>
<span class="s0">jesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate, with a vague</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness that she was not Bonaparte's servant, was really,</span>
<span class="s0">simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia.</span>
<span class="s0">But Count Rostopchin, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now</span>
<span class="s0">had the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless</span>
<span class="s0">weapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the</span>
<span class="s0">icons, and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics</span>
<span class="s0">of saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one</span>
<span class="s0">hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being</span>
<span class="s0">constructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and</span>
<span class="s0">related how he had set fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation</span>
<span class="s0">to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his</span>
<span class="s0">Orphanage; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and now repudiated the deed; now ordered the people to catch</span>
<span class="s0">all spies and bring them to him, and now reproached them for doing so;</span>
<span class="s0">now expelled all the French residents from Moscow, and now allowed</span>
<span class="s0">Madame Aubert-Chalme (the center of the whole French colony in Moscow)</span>
<span class="s0">to remain, but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyucharev to be</span>
<span class="s0">arrested and exiled for no particular offense; now assembled the</span>
<span class="s0">people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now, to get rid of</span>
<span class="s0">them, handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by</span>
<span class="s0">a back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share</span>
<span class="s0">in the affair--this man did not understand the meaning of what was</span>
<span class="s0">happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would</span>
<span class="s0">astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a</span>
<span class="s0">child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event--the</span>
<span class="s0">abandonment and burning of Moscow--and tried with his puny hand now to</span>
<span class="s0">speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him along</span>
<span class="s0">with it.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">Helene, having returned with the court from Vilna to Petersburg,</span>
<span class="s0">found herself in a difficult position.</span>

<span class="s0">In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee</span>
<span class="s0">who occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In Vilna she</span>
<span class="s0">had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she</span>
<span class="s0">returned to Petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there, and</span>
<span class="s0">both claimed their rights. Helene was faced by a new problem--how to</span>
<span class="s0">preserve her intimacy with both without offending either.</span>

<span class="s0">What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman</span>
<span class="s0">did not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezukhova, who</span>
<span class="s0">evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had</span>
<span class="s0">she attempted concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her</span>
<span class="s0">awkward position by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by</span>
<span class="s0">acknowledging herself guilty. But Helene, like a really great man</span>
<span class="s0">who can do whatever he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be</span>
<span class="s0">correct, as she sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else</span>
<span class="s0">was to blame.</span>

<span class="s0">The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach</span>
<span class="s0">her, she lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said</span>
<span class="s0">firmly: &quot;That's just like a man--selfish and cruel! I expected nothing</span>
<span class="s0">else. A woman sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her</span>
<span class="s0">reward! What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my</span>
<span class="s0">attachments and friendships? He is a man who has been more than a</span>
<span class="s0">father to me!&quot; The prince was about to say something, but Helene</span>
<span class="s0">interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said she, &quot;it may be that he has other sentiments for</span>
<span class="s0">me than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut</span>
<span class="s0">my door on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with</span>
<span class="s0">ingratitude! Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my</span>
<span class="s0">intimate feelings I render account only to God and to my</span>
<span class="s0">conscience,&quot; she concluded, laying her hand on her beautiful, fully</span>
<span class="s0">expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But for heaven's sake listen to me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Marry me, and I will be your slave!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But that's impossible.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You won't deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Helene, beginning to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">The prince tried to comfort her, but Helene, as if quite distraught,</span>
<span class="s0">said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,</span>
<span class="s0">that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but</span>
<span class="s0">she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she</span>
<span class="s0">had never been her husband's wife, and that she had been sacrificed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But the law, religion...&quot; said the prince, already yielding.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can't</span>
<span class="s0">arrange that?&quot; said Helene.</span>

<span class="s0">The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred</span>
<span class="s0">to him, and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the</span>
<span class="s0">Society of Jesus, with whom he was on intimate terms.</span>

<span class="s0">A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Helene</span>
<span class="s0">gave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur</span>
<span class="s0">de Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant</span>
<span class="s0">black eyes, a Jesuit a robe courte* was presented to her, and in the</span>
<span class="s0">garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music</span>
<span class="s0">talked to her for a long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the</span>
<span class="s0">Sacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion</span>
<span class="s0">affords in this world and the next. Helene was touched, and more</span>
<span class="s0">than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur de Jobert</span>
<span class="s0">and their voices trembled. A dance, for which her partner came to seek</span>
<span class="s0">her, put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de</span>
<span class="s0">conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to see Helene</span>
<span class="s0">when she was alone, and after that often came again.</span>


<span class="s0">*Lay member of the Society of Jesus.</span>


<span class="s0">One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she</span>
<span class="s0">knelt down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting,</span>
<span class="s0">middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself</span>
<span class="s0">afterward described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze</span>
<span class="s0">wafted into her soul. It was explained to her that this was la grace.</span>

<span class="s0">After that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her. She confessed</span>
<span class="s0">to him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box</span>
<span class="s0">containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to</span>
<span class="s0">partake of. A few days later Helene learned with pleasure that she had</span>
<span class="s0">now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days</span>
<span class="s0">the Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain</span>
<span class="s0">document.</span>

<span class="s0">All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the</span>
<span class="s0">attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was</span>
<span class="s0">now in (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time)</span>
<span class="s0">gave her pleasure, but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment</span>
<span class="s0">to forget her aim. And as it always happens in contests of cunning</span>
<span class="s0">that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones, Helene-</span>
<span class="s0">having realized that the main object of all these words and all this</span>
<span class="s0">trouble was, after converting her to Catholicism, to obtain money from</span>
<span class="s0">her for Jesuit institutions (as to which she received indications)-</span>
<span class="s0">before parting with her money insisted that the various operations</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to free her from her husband should be performed. In her</span>
<span class="s0">view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain</span>
<span class="s0">proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires. And with</span>
<span class="s0">this aim, in one of her talks with her Father Confessor, she</span>
<span class="s0">insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she bound by her</span>
<span class="s0">marriage?</span>

<span class="s0">They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.</span>
<span class="s0">The scent of flowers came in at the window. Helene was wearing a white</span>
<span class="s0">dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbe, a</span>
<span class="s0">well-fed man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth,</span>
<span class="s0">and white hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Helene and,</span>
<span class="s0">with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at</span>
<span class="s0">her beauty, occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his</span>
<span class="s0">opinion on the subject. Helene with an uneasy smile looked at his</span>
<span class="s0">curly hair and his plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every</span>
<span class="s0">moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbe,</span>
<span class="s0">though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was</span>
<span class="s0">absorbed in his mastery of the matter.</span>

<span class="s0">The course of the Father Confessor's arguments ran as follows:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow</span>
<span class="s0">of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married</span>
<span class="s0">state without faith in the religious significance of marriage,</span>
<span class="s0">committed an act of sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual</span>
<span class="s0">significance it should have had. Yet in spite of this your vow was</span>
<span class="s0">binding. You swerved from it. What did you commit by so acting? A</span>
<span class="s0">venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you acted without evil</span>
<span class="s0">intention. If now you married again with the object of bearing</span>
<span class="s0">children, your sin might be forgiven. But the question is again a</span>
<span class="s0">twofold one: firstly...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But suddenly Helene, who was getting bored, said with one of her</span>
<span class="s0">bewitching smiles: &quot;But I think that having espoused the true religion</span>
<span class="s0">I cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case</span>
<span class="s0">presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus' egg. He was</span>
<span class="s0">delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil's progress, but</span>
<span class="s0">could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously</span>
<span class="s0">constructed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let us understand one another, Countess,&quot; said he with a smile, and</span>
<span class="s0">began refuting his spiritual daughter's arguments.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">Helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from</span>
<span class="s0">the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making</span>
<span class="s0">difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the</span>
<span class="s0">matter would be regarded by the secular authorities.</span>

<span class="s0">So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of</span>
<span class="s0">society. She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him</span>
<span class="s0">what she had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so</span>
<span class="s0">that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her.</span>
<span class="s0">The elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this</span>
<span class="s0">suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive, as the</span>
<span class="s0">younger man had been, but Helene's imperturbable conviction that it</span>
<span class="s0">was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him</span>
<span class="s0">too. Had Helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation, shame,</span>
<span class="s0">or secrecy, her cause would certainly have been lost; but not only did</span>
<span class="s0">she show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the contrary, with</span>
<span class="s0">good-natured naivete she told her intimate friends (and these were all</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her</span>
<span class="s0">and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.</span>

<span class="s0">A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Helene wanted</span>
<span class="s0">to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would</span>
<span class="s0">have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the</span>
<span class="s0">unfortunate and interesting Helene was in doubt which of the two men</span>
<span class="s0">she should marry. The question was no longer whether this was</span>
<span class="s0">possible, but only which was the better match and how the matter would</span>
<span class="s0">be regarded at court. There were, it is true, some rigid individuals</span>
<span class="s0">unable to rise to the height of such a question, who saw in the</span>
<span class="s0">project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, but there were not</span>
<span class="s0">many such and they remained silent, while the majority were interested</span>
<span class="s0">in Helene's good fortune and in the question which match would be</span>
<span class="s0">the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to remarry</span>
<span class="s0">while one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question</span>
<span class="s0">had evidently been settled by people &quot;wiser than you or me,&quot; as they</span>
<span class="s0">said, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk</span>
<span class="s0">exposing one's stupidity and incapacity to live in society.</span>

<span class="s0">Only Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, had come to Petersburg that</span>
<span class="s0">summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an</span>
<span class="s0">opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Helene at a ball she</span>
<span class="s0">stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence,</span>
<span class="s0">said in her gruff voice: &quot;So wives of living men have started marrying</span>
<span class="s0">again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been</span>
<span class="s0">forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all</span>
<span class="s0">the brothels,&quot; and with these words Marya Dmitrievna, turning up her</span>
<span class="s0">wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly</span>
<span class="s0">round, moved across the room.</span>

<span class="s0">Though people were afraid of Marya Dmitrievna she was regarded in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only</span>
<span class="s0">noticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had</span>
<span class="s0">used, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Vasili, who of late very often forgot what he had said and</span>
<span class="s0">repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his</span>
<span class="s0">daughter whenever he chanced to see her:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Helene, I have a word to say to you,&quot; and he would lead her</span>
<span class="s0">aside, drawing her hand downward. &quot;I have heard of certain projects</span>
<span class="s0">concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father's</span>
<span class="s0">heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much....</span>
<span class="s0">But, my dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to</span>
<span class="s0">say,&quot; and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek</span>
<span class="s0">against his daughter's and move away.</span>

<span class="s0">Bilibin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever</span>
<span class="s0">man, and who was one of the disinterested friends so</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant a woman as Helene always has--men friends who can never</span>
<span class="s0">change into lovers--once gave her his view of the matter at a small</span>
<span class="s0">and intimate gathering.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Listen, Bilibin,&quot; said Helene (she always called friends of that</span>
<span class="s0">sort by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her</span>
<span class="s0">white, beringed fingers. &quot;Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought</span>
<span class="s0">to do. Which of the two?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with</span>
<span class="s0">a smile on his lips.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are not taking me unawares, you know,&quot; said he. &quot;As a true</span>
<span class="s0">friend, I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see,</span>
<span class="s0">if you marry the prince&quot;--he meant the younger man--and he crooked one</span>
<span class="s0">finger, &quot;you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you</span>
<span class="s0">will displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of</span>
<span class="s0">connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last</span>
<span class="s0">days happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be</span>
<span class="s0">making a mesalliance by marrying you,&quot; and Bilibin smoothed out his</span>
<span class="s0">forehead.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's a true friend!&quot; said Helene beaming, and again touching</span>
<span class="s0">Bilibin's sleeve. &quot;But I love them, you know, and don't want to</span>
<span class="s0">distress either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of</span>
<span class="s0">them both.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Bilibin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he</span>
<span class="s0">could help in that difficulty.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Une maitresse-femme!* That's what is called putting things</span>
<span class="s0">squarely. She would like to be married to all three at the same time,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">thought he.</span>


<span class="s0">*A masterly woman.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?&quot; Bilibin</span>
<span class="s0">asked, his reputation being so well established that he did not fear</span>
<span class="s0">to ask so naive a question. &quot;Will he agree?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, he loves me so!&quot; said Helene, who for some reason imagined that</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre too loved her. &quot;He will do anything for me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Even divorce you?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">Helene laughed.</span>

<span class="s0">Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed</span>
<span class="s0">marriage was Helene's mother, Princess Kuragina. She was continually</span>
<span class="s0">tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned</span>
<span class="s0">a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to</span>
<span class="s0">the idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">divorce and remarriage during a husband's lifetime, and the priest</span>
<span class="s0">told her that it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a</span>
<span class="s0">text in the Gospel which (as it seemed to him) plainly remarriage</span>
<span class="s0">while the husband is alive.</span>

<span class="s0">Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable,</span>
<span class="s0">she drove to her daughter's early one morning so as to find her alone.</span>

<span class="s0">Having listened to her mother's objections, Helene smiled blandly</span>
<span class="s0">and ironically.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it says plainly: 'Whosoever shall marry her that is</span>
<span class="s0">divorced...'&quot; said the old princess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de betises. Vous ne comprenez rein. Dans ma</span>
<span class="s0">position j'ai des devoirs,&quot;* said Helene changing from Russian, in</span>
<span class="s0">which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite</span>
<span class="s0">clear, into French which suited it better.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Oh, Mamma, don't talk nonsense! You don't understand anything.</span>
<span class="s0">In my position I have obligations.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;But, my dear....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Mamma, how is it you don't understand that the Holy Father, who</span>
<span class="s0">has the right to grant dispensations...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Just then the lady companion who lived with Helene came in to</span>
<span class="s0">announce that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse</span>
<span class="s0">contre lui, parce qu'il m' a manque parole.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;No, tell him I don't wish to see him, I am furious with him for</span>
<span class="s0">not keeping his word to me.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Comtesse, a tout peche misericorde,&quot;* said a fair-haired young</span>
<span class="s0">man with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Countess, there is mercy for every sin.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who</span>
<span class="s0">had entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter</span>
<span class="s0">and sidled out of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, she is right,&quot; thought the old princess, all her convictions</span>
<span class="s0">dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. &quot;She is right, but how</span>
<span class="s0">is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so</span>
<span class="s0">simple,&quot; she thought as she got into her carriage.</span>


<span class="s0">By the beginning of August Helene's affairs were clearly defined and</span>
<span class="s0">she wrote a letter to her husband--who, as she imagined, loved her</span>
<span class="s0">very much--informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her</span>
<span class="s0">having embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all</span>
<span class="s0">the formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to</span>
<span class="s0">him by the bearer of the letter.</span>


<span class="s0">And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful</span>
<span class="s0">keeping--Your friend Helene.</span>


<span class="s0">This letter was brought to Pierre's house when he was on the field</span>
<span class="s0">of Borodino.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">Toward the end of the battle of Borodino, Pierre, having run down</span>
<span class="s0">from Raevski's battery a second time, made his way through a gully</span>
<span class="s0">to Knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station,</span>
<span class="s0">and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still</span>
<span class="s0">entangled in the crowds of soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away</span>
<span class="s0">quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that</span>
<span class="s0">day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a</span>
<span class="s0">room in his own bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of</span>
<span class="s0">life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and</span>
<span class="s0">felt. But such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.</span>

<span class="s0">Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along</span>
<span class="s0">which he was going, still on all sides there was what there had been</span>
<span class="s0">on the field of battle. There were still the same suffering,</span>
<span class="s0">exhausted, and sometimes strangely indifferent faces, the same</span>
<span class="s0">blood, the same soldiers' overcoats, the same sounds of firing</span>
<span class="s0">which, though distant now, still aroused terror, and besides this</span>
<span class="s0">there were the foul air and the dust.</span>

<span class="s0">Having gone a couple of miles along the Mozhaysk road, Pierre sat</span>
<span class="s0">down by the roadside.</span>

<span class="s0">Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay</span>
<span class="s0">leaning on his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved</span>
<span class="s0">past him in the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon</span>
<span class="s0">ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he</span>
<span class="s0">shuddered and sat up. He had no idea how long he had been there. In</span>
<span class="s0">the middle of the night three soldiers, having brought some</span>
<span class="s0">firewood, settled down near him and began lighting a fire.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire</span>
<span class="s0">to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some</span>
<span class="s0">dried bread and put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy</span>
<span class="s0">viands mingled with the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed.</span>
<span class="s0">The three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves, taking no</span>
<span class="s0">notice of him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And who may you be?&quot; one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: &quot;If you want to eat</span>
<span class="s0">we'll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest</span>
<span class="s0">man.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I, I...&quot; said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social</span>
<span class="s0">position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and</span>
<span class="s0">better understood by them. &quot;By rights I am a militia officer, but my</span>
<span class="s0">men are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There now!&quot; said one of the soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">Another shook his head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Would you like a little mash?&quot; the first soldier asked, and</span>
<span class="s0">handed Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they</span>
<span class="s0">called the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than</span>
<span class="s0">any food he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it,</span>
<span class="s0">helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another,</span>
<span class="s0">his was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where have you to go to? Tell us!&quot; said one of them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To Mozhaysk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're a gentleman, aren't you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And what's your name?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Peter Kirilych.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well then, Peter Kirilych, come along with us, we'll take you</span>
<span class="s0">there.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozhaysk.</span>

<span class="s0">By the time they got near Mozhaysk and began ascending the steep</span>
<span class="s0">hill into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on</span>
<span class="s0">with the soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom</span>
<span class="s0">of the hill and that he had already passed it. He would not soon</span>
<span class="s0">have remembered this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he</span>
<span class="s0">not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to</span>
<span class="s0">look for him in the town and was returning to the inn. The groom</span>
<span class="s0">recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency!&quot; he said. &quot;Why, we were beginning to despair!</span>
<span class="s0">How is it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldiers stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you've found your folk?&quot; said one of them. &quot;Well, good-by, Peter</span>
<span class="s0">Kirilych--isn't it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by, Peter Kirilych!&quot; Pierre heard the other voices repeat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by!&quot; he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I ought to give them something!&quot; he thought, and felt in his</span>
<span class="s0">pocket. &quot;No, better not!&quot; said another, inner voice.</span>

<span class="s0">There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all,</span>
<span class="s0">lay down in his carriage.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt</span>
<span class="s0">himself falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness</span>
<span class="s0">of reality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of</span>
<span class="s0">projectiles, groans and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of horror and dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he</span>
<span class="s0">opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was</span>
<span class="s0">tranquil in the yard. Only someone's orderly passed through the</span>
<span class="s0">gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement he had made in</span>
<span class="s0">sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse. The</span>
<span class="s0">whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable</span>
<span class="s0">yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear</span>
<span class="s0">starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thank God, there is no more of that!&quot; he thought, covering up his</span>
<span class="s0">head again. &quot;Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I</span>
<span class="s0">yielded to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time,</span>
<span class="s0">to the end...&quot; thought he.</span>

<span class="s0">They, in Pierre's mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the</span>
<span class="s0">battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before</span>
<span class="s0">the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood</span>
<span class="s0">out clearly and sharply from everyone else.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To be a soldier, just a soldier!&quot; thought Pierre as he fell asleep,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;to enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them</span>
<span class="s0">what they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden</span>
<span class="s0">of my outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could</span>
<span class="s0">have run away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been</span>
<span class="s0">sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with Dolokhov.&quot; And the</span>
<span class="s0">memory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov flashed through Pierre's mind, and then he remembered his</span>
<span class="s0">benefactor at Torzhok. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the</span>
<span class="s0">lodge presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English</span>
<span class="s0">Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!&quot; thought Pierre.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I am that he</span>
<span class="s0">died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!&quot; On one side of the</span>
<span class="s0">table sat Anatole, Dolokhov, Nesvitski, Denisov, and others like</span>
<span class="s0">them (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as</span>
<span class="s0">clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed</span>
<span class="s0">they), and he heard those people, Anatole and Dolokhov, shouting and</span>
<span class="s0">singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor</span>
<span class="s0">was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as</span>
<span class="s0">weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor</span>
<span class="s0">was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite</span>
<span class="s0">distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the</span>
<span class="s0">possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,</span>
<span class="s0">firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they</span>
<span class="s0">were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him.</span>
<span class="s0">Wishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at</span>
<span class="s0">that moment his legs grew cold and bare.</span>

<span class="s0">He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his</span>
<span class="s0">cloak had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his</span>
<span class="s0">cloak Pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs,</span>
<span class="s0">posts, and yard, but now they were all bluish, lit up, and</span>
<span class="s0">glittering with frost or dew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is dawn,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;But that's not what I want. I want to</span>
<span class="s0">hear and understand my benefactor's words.&quot; Again he covered himself</span>
<span class="s0">up with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was</span>
<span class="s0">there. There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts</span>
<span class="s0">that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.</span>

<span class="s0">Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that</span>
<span class="s0">someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of</span>
<span class="s0">that day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to</span>
<span class="s0">think and express his thoughts like that when awake.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man's</span>
<span class="s0">freedom to the law of God,&quot; the voice had said. &quot;Simplicity is</span>
<span class="s0">submission to the will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they</span>
<span class="s0">are simple. They do not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but</span>
<span class="s0">the unspoken is golden. Man can be master of nothing while he fears</span>
<span class="s0">death, but he who does not fear it possesses all. If there were no</span>
<span class="s0">suffering, man would not know his limitations, would not know himself.</span>
<span class="s0">The hardest thing [Pierre went on thinking, or hearing, in his</span>
<span class="s0">dream] is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all. To</span>
<span class="s0">unite all?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;No, not to unite. Thoughts cannot be</span>
<span class="s0">united, but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need!</span>
<span class="s0">Yes, one must harness them, must harness them!&quot; he repeated to himself</span>
<span class="s0">with inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone expressed</span>
<span class="s0">what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your</span>
<span class="s0">excellency!&quot; some voice was repeating. &quot;We must harness, it is time to</span>
<span class="s0">harness....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone</span>
<span class="s0">straight into Pierre's face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the</span>
<span class="s0">middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump</span>
<span class="s0">while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with</span>
<span class="s0">repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage</span>
<span class="s0">seat. &quot;No, I don't want that, I don't want to see and understand that.</span>
<span class="s0">I want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream.</span>
<span class="s0">One second more and I should have understood it all! But what am I</span>
<span class="s0">to do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?&quot; and Pierre felt</span>
<span class="s0">with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the</span>
<span class="s0">dream had been destroyed.</span>

<span class="s0">The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an</span>
<span class="s0">officer had come with news that the French were already near</span>
<span class="s0">Mozhaysk and that our men were leaving it.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him,</span>
<span class="s0">went on foot through the town.</span>

<span class="s0">The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind</span>
<span class="s0">them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses,</span>
<span class="s0">and the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts</span>
<span class="s0">that were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and</span>
<span class="s0">blows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which</span>
<span class="s0">had overtaken him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him</span>
<span class="s0">to Moscow. On the way Pierre was told of the death of his</span>
<span class="s0">brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">On the thirteenth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the</span>
<span class="s0">gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchin's adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We have been looking for you everywhere,&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;The</span>
<span class="s0">count wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at</span>
<span class="s0">once on a very important matter.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his</span>
<span class="s0">summer villa at Sokolniki. The anteroom and reception room of his</span>
<span class="s0">house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for</span>
<span class="s0">orders. Vasilchikov and Platov had already seen the count and</span>
<span class="s0">explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it</span>
<span class="s0">would have to be surrendered. Though this news was being concealed</span>
<span class="s0">from the inhabitants, the officials--the heads of the various</span>
<span class="s0">government departments--knew that Moscow would soon be in the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy's hands, just as Count Rostopchin himself knew it, and to escape</span>
<span class="s0">personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how</span>
<span class="s0">they were to deal with their various departments.</span>

<span class="s0">As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army</span>
<span class="s0">came out of Rostopchin's private room.</span>

<span class="s0">In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a</span>
<span class="s0">despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.</span>

<span class="s0">While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched</span>
<span class="s0">the various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who</span>
<span class="s0">were there. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to</span>
<span class="s0">a group of men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they</span>
<span class="s0">continued their conversation.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If they're sent out and brought back again later on it will do no</span>
<span class="s0">harm, but as things are now one can't answer for anything.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you see what he writes...&quot; said another, pointing to a</span>
<span class="s0">printed sheet he held in his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's another matter. That's necessary for the people,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">first.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, it's a fresh broadsheet.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre took it and began reading.</span>


<span class="s0">His Serene Highness has passed through Mozhaysk in order to join</span>
<span class="s0">up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong</span>
<span class="s0">position where the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty eight guns</span>
<span class="s0">with ammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene</span>
<span class="s0">Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is</span>
<span class="s0">even ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that</span>
<span class="s0">the law courts are closed; things have to be put in order, and we will</span>
<span class="s0">deal with villains in our own way! When the time comes I shall want</span>
<span class="s0">both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two</span>
<span class="s0">beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will</span>
<span class="s0">be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be</span>
<span class="s0">best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow</span>
<span class="s0">after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water</span>
<span class="s0">blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now:</span>
<span class="s0">one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the</span>
<span class="s0">town,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;and that the position...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, of course! That's what we were saying,&quot; replied the first</span>
<span class="s0">speaker.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And what does he mean by 'One of my eyes was sore but now I am on</span>
<span class="s0">the lookout with both'?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The count had a sty,&quot; replied the adjutant smiling, &quot;and was very</span>
<span class="s0">much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the</span>
<span class="s0">matter with him. By the by, Count,&quot; he added suddenly, addressing</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre with a smile, &quot;we heard that you have family troubles and</span>
<span class="s0">that the countess, your wife...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have heard nothing,&quot; Pierre replied unconcernedly. &quot;But what have</span>
<span class="s0">you heard?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I</span>
<span class="s0">heard.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what did you hear?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, they say,&quot; continued the adjutant with the same smile,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;that the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect</span>
<span class="s0">it's nonsense....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Possibly,&quot; remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. &quot;And</span>
<span class="s0">who is that?&quot; he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue</span>
<span class="s0">peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy</span>
<span class="s0">face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He? That's a tradesman, that is to say, he's the restaurant keeper,</span>
<span class="s0">Vereshchagin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the</span>
<span class="s0">proclamation.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, so that is Vereshchagin!&quot; said Pierre, looking at the firm,</span>
<span class="s0">calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a</span>
<span class="s0">traitor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's not he himself, that's the father of the fellow who wrote</span>
<span class="s0">the proclamation,&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;The young man is in prison</span>
<span class="s0">and I expect it will go hard with him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German</span>
<span class="s0">wearing a cross round his neck, approached the speaker.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's a complicated story, you know,&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;That</span>
<span class="s0">proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed</span>
<span class="s0">of it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivanovich</span>
<span class="s0">here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly</span>
<span class="s0">sixty-three hands. He asked one, 'From whom did you get it?' 'From</span>
<span class="s0">so-and-so.' He went to the next one. 'From whom did you get it?' and</span>
<span class="s0">so on till he reached Vereshchagin, a half educated tradesman, you</span>
<span class="s0">know, 'a pet of a trader,'&quot; said the adjutant smiling. &quot;They asked</span>
<span class="s0">him, 'Who gave it you?' And the point is that we knew whom he had it</span>
<span class="s0">from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently</span>
<span class="s0">they had come to some understanding. He replied: 'From no one; I</span>
<span class="s0">made it up myself.' They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck</span>
<span class="s0">to that: 'I made it up myself.' And so it was reported to the count,</span>
<span class="s0">who sent for the man. 'From whom did you get the proclamation?' 'I</span>
<span class="s0">wrote it myself.' Well, you know the count,&quot; said the adjutant</span>
<span class="s0">cheerfully, with a smile of pride, &quot;he flared up dreadfully--and</span>
<span class="s0">just think of the fellow's audacity, lying, and obstinacy!&quot;</span>

 <span class="s0">&quot;And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharev? I</span>
<span class="s0">understand!&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not at all,&quot; rejoined the adjutant in dismay. &quot;Klyucharev had his</span>
<span class="s0">own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been</span>
<span class="s0">banished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. 'How could</span>
<span class="s0">you have written it yourself?' said he, and he took up the Hamburg</span>
<span class="s0">Gazette that was lying on the table. 'Here it is! You did not write it</span>
<span class="s0">yourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because</span>
<span class="s0">you don't even know French, you fool.' And what do you think? 'No,'</span>
<span class="s0">said he, 'I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.' 'If that's</span>
<span class="s0">so, you're a traitor and I'll have you tried, and you'll be hanged!</span>
<span class="s0">Say from whom you had it.' 'I have seen no papers, I made it up</span>
<span class="s0">myself.' And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched,</span>
<span class="s0">but the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to</span>
<span class="s0">hard labor, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him.</span>
<span class="s0">But he's a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman's</span>
<span class="s0">son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere</span>
<span class="s0">and imagines that the devil is no match for him. That's the sort of</span>
<span class="s0">fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge,</span>
<span class="s0">and you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a</span>
<span class="s0">scepter in one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon</span>
<span class="s0">home with him for a few days and what did he do? He found some</span>
<span class="s0">scoundrel of a painter...&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief.</span>

<span class="s0">When he entered the private room Count Rostopchin, puckering his</span>
<span class="s0">face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was</span>
<span class="s0">saying something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went</span>
<span class="s0">out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, how do you do, great warrior?&quot; said Rostopchin as soon as the</span>
<span class="s0">short man had left the room. &quot;We have heard of your prowess. But</span>
<span class="s0">that's not the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to</span>
<span class="s0">the Masons?&quot; he went on severely, as though there were something wrong</span>
<span class="s0">about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained</span>
<span class="s0">silent. &quot;I am well informed, my friend, but I am aware that there</span>
<span class="s0">are Masons and I hope that you are not one of those who</span>
<span class="s0">on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin Russia.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I am a Mason,&quot; Pierre replied.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs.</span>
<span class="s0">Speranski and Magnitski have been deported to their proper place.</span>
<span class="s0">Mr. Klyucharev has been treated in the same way, and so have others</span>
<span class="s0">who on the plea of building up the temple of Solomon have tried to</span>
<span class="s0">destroy the temple of their fatherland. You can understand that</span>
<span class="s0">there are reasons for this and that I could not have exiled the</span>
<span class="s0">Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It has now come to my</span>
<span class="s0">knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town,</span>
<span class="s0">and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody. I</span>
<span class="s0">like you and don't wish you any harm and--as you are only half my age-</span>
<span class="s0">I advise you, as a father would, to cease all communication with men</span>
<span class="s0">of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what did Klyucharev do wrong, Count?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,&quot; shouted</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If he is accused of circulating Napoleon's proclamation it is not</span>
<span class="s0">proved that he did so,&quot; said Pierre without looking at Rostopchin,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;and Vereshchagin...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There we are!&quot; Rostopchin shouted at Pierre louder than before,</span>
<span class="s0">frowning suddenly. &quot;Vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who</span>
<span class="s0">will be punished as he deserves,&quot; said he with the vindictive heat</span>
<span class="s0">with which people speak when recalling an insult. &quot;But I did not</span>
<span class="s0">summon you to discuss my actions, but to give you advice--or an</span>
<span class="s0">order if you prefer it. I beg you to leave the town and break off</span>
<span class="s0">all communication with such men as Klyucharev. And I will knock the</span>
<span class="s0">nonsense out of anybody&quot;--but probably realizing that he was</span>
<span class="s0">shouting at Bezukhov who so far was not guilty of anything, he</span>
<span class="s0">added, taking Pierre's hand in a friendly manner, &quot;We are on the eve</span>
<span class="s0">of a public disaster and I haven't time to be polite to everybody</span>
<span class="s0">who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon</span>
<span class="s0">cher, what are you doing personally?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, nothing,&quot; answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing</span>
<span class="s0">the thoughtful expression of his face.</span>

<span class="s0">The count frowned.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can,</span>
<span class="s0">that's all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear fellow. Oh, by the by!&quot; he shouted through the doorway after</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, &quot;is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches</span>
<span class="s0">of the holy fathers of the Society of Jesus?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchin's room more sullen and</span>
<span class="s0">angry than he had ever before shown himself.</span>

<span class="s0">When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight</span>
<span class="s0">people had come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee,</span>
<span class="s0">the colonel of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various</span>
<span class="s0">petitioners. They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions</span>
<span class="s0">from him. Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of</span>
<span class="s0">these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these</span>
<span class="s0">people. When left alone at last he opened and read his wife's letter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old</span>
<span class="s0">man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary...</span>
<span class="s0">the meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting</span>
<span class="s0">married... One must forget and understand...&quot; And going to his bed</span>
<span class="s0">he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.</span>

<span class="s0">When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that</span>
<span class="s0">a special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin to know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving</span>
<span class="s0">the town.</span>

<span class="s0">A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to</span>
<span class="s0">see them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.</span>

<span class="s0">From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of</span>
<span class="s0">Bezukhov's household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">again or knew where he was.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">The Rostovs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,</span>
<span class="s0">till the eve of the enemy's entry into the city.</span>

<span class="s0">After Petya had joined Obolenski's regiment of Cossacks and left for</span>
<span class="s0">Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was</span>
<span class="s0">seized with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war,</span>
<span class="s0">had both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or</span>
<span class="s0">both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances, struck her that summer for the first time with cruel</span>
<span class="s0">clearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself</span>
<span class="s0">to join Petya, or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg,</span>
<span class="s0">but neither of these proved possible. Petya could not return unless</span>
<span class="s0">his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment</span>
<span class="s0">on active service. Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not</span>
<span class="s0">sent a word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed</span>
<span class="s0">account of his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not</span>
<span class="s0">sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her</span>
<span class="s0">sons lying dead. After many consultations and conversations, the count</span>
<span class="s0">at last devised means to tranquillize her. He got Petya transferred</span>
<span class="s0">from Obolenski's regiment to Bezukhov's, which was in training near</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. Though Petya would remain in the service, this transfer</span>
<span class="s0">would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of</span>
<span class="s0">her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her</span>
<span class="s0">Petya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to</span>
<span class="s0">places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved</span>
<span class="s0">her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached</span>
<span class="s0">herself for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad</span>
<span class="s0">at lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself</span>
<span class="s0">a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black</span>
<span class="s0">eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show-</span>
<span class="s0">when he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were</span>
<span class="s0">fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure</span>
<span class="s0">in it--then his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all</span>
<span class="s0">her other children. The nearer the time came for Petya to return,</span>
<span class="s0">the more uneasy grew the countess. She began to think she would</span>
<span class="s0">never live to see such happiness. The presence of Sonya, of her</span>
<span class="s0">beloved Natasha, or even of her husband irritated her. &quot;What do I want</span>
<span class="s0">with them? I want no one but Petya,&quot; she thought.</span>

<span class="s0">At the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas. He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had been</span>
<span class="s0">sent to procure remounts, but that letter did not set the countess</span>
<span class="s0">at ease. Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more</span>
<span class="s0">anxious about Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to</span>
<span class="s0">persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible, she would</span>
<span class="s0">not bear of leaving before her treasure, her adored Petya, returned.</span>
<span class="s0">On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness</span>
<span class="s0">with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old</span>
<span class="s0">officer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him</span>
<span class="s0">under her wing, Petya guessed her designs, and instinctively fearing</span>
<span class="s0">that he might give way to emotion when with her--might &quot;become</span>
<span class="s0">womanish&quot; as he termed it to himself--he treated her coldly, avoided</span>
<span class="s0">her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly</span>
<span class="s0">tenderness, almost lover-like.</span>

<span class="s0">Owing to the count's customary carelessness nothing was ready for</span>
<span class="s0">their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were</span>
<span class="s0">to come from their Ryazan and Moscow estates to remove their household</span>
<span class="s0">belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.</span>

<span class="s0">From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a</span>
<span class="s0">bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodino</span>
<span class="s0">were brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts</span>
<span class="s0">of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their</span>
<span class="s0">possessions out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopchin's</span>
<span class="s0">broadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the</span>
<span class="s0">strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some</span>
<span class="s0">said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the</span>
<span class="s0">contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches</span>
<span class="s0">and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had been</span>
<span class="s0">another battle after Borodino at which the French had been routed,</span>
<span class="s0">while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army bad been</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the</span>
<span class="s0">clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin</span>
<span class="s0">had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the</span>
<span class="s0">peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and</span>
<span class="s0">so on. But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of</span>
<span class="s0">Fili, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been</span>
<span class="s0">held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt,</span>
<span class="s0">though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned,</span>
<span class="s0">and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save</span>
<span class="s0">their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break</span>
<span class="s0">up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.</span>
<span class="s0">As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die</span>
<span class="s0">immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is</span>
<span class="s0">awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,</span>
<span class="s0">though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the</span>
<span class="s0">conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would</span>
<span class="s0">be completely upset.</span>

<span class="s0">During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the</span>
<span class="s0">family, Count Ilya Rostov, continually drove about the city collecting</span>
<span class="s0">the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty</span>
<span class="s0">orders at home about the preparations for their departure.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied</span>
<span class="s0">with everything, was constantly in pursuit of Petya who was always</span>
<span class="s0">running away from her, and was jealous of Natasha with whom he spent</span>
<span class="s0">all his time. Sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by</span>
<span class="s0">getting things packed. But of late Sonya had been particularly sad and</span>
<span class="s0">silent. Nicholas' letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had</span>
<span class="s0">elicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who</span>
<span class="s0">saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess</span>
<span class="s0">and Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was never pleased at Bolkonski's engagement to Natasha,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">countess, &quot;but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had</span>
<span class="s0">a presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">retrieving the Rostovs' affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman,</span>
<span class="s0">and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her.</span>
<span class="s0">But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on</span>
<span class="s0">herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of</span>
<span class="s0">their things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess</span>
<span class="s0">turned to her when they had any orders to give. Petya and Natasha on</span>
<span class="s0">the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a</span>
<span class="s0">nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long the house</span>
<span class="s0">resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their</span>
<span class="s0">spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there</span>
<span class="s0">was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their</span>
<span class="s0">hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and</span>
<span class="s0">laughter to them. Petya was in high spirits because having left home a</span>
<span class="s0">boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man,</span>
<span class="s0">because he was at home, because he had left Belaya Tserkov where there</span>
<span class="s0">was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her</span>
<span class="s0">of the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was</span>
<span class="s0">also happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of</span>
<span class="s0">others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them</span>
<span class="s0">run freely--and Petya adored her. Above all, they were gay because</span>
<span class="s0">there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town</span>
<span class="s0">gates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping--going away</span>
<span class="s0">somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and</span>
<span class="s0">that is always exciting, especially to the young.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs' house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the</span>
<span class="s0">furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and</span>
<span class="s0">pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay,</span>
<span class="s0">wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house</span>
<span class="s0">serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet</span>
<span class="s0">floors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high</span>
<span class="s0">and already corded up, others still empty.</span>

<span class="s0">The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants</span>
<span class="s0">who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another</span>
<span class="s0">in the yard and in the house. The count bad been out since morning.</span>
<span class="s0">The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil</span>
<span class="s0">and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress</span>
<span class="s0">on her head. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with</span>
<span class="s0">whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active</span>
<span class="s0">army. Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass</span>
<span class="s0">and china. Natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room</span>
<span class="s0">with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing</span>
<span class="s0">fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress</span>
<span class="s0">(already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg</span>
<span class="s0">ball.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy,</span>
<span class="s0">and several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart</span>
<span class="s0">was not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything</span>
<span class="s0">except with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood</span>
<span class="s0">beside Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but</span>
<span class="s0">soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At</span>
<span class="s0">first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the</span>
<span class="s0">maids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be</span>
<span class="s0">packed, she found it dull.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dunyasha, you pack! You will, won't you, dear?&quot; And when Dunyasha</span>
<span class="s0">willingly promised to do it all for her, Natasha sat down on the</span>
<span class="s0">floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite</span>
<span class="s0">unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was</span>
<span class="s0">roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room</span>
<span class="s0">(which was theirs) and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going</span>
<span class="s0">to the back porch. Natasha got up and looked out of the window. An</span>
<span class="s0">enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the</span>
<span class="s0">street.</span>

<span class="s0">The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,</span>
<span class="s0">postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and</span>
<span class="s0">holding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.</span>

<span class="s0">The former housekeeper, old Mavra Kuzminichna, had stepped out of</span>
<span class="s0">the crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of</span>
<span class="s0">bast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her</span>
<span class="s0">handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then you have nobody in Moscow?&quot; she was saying. &quot;You would be more</span>
<span class="s0">comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the</span>
<span class="s0">family are leaving.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't know if it would be allowed,&quot; replied the officer in a weak</span>
<span class="s0">voice. &quot;Here is our commanding officer... ask him,&quot; and he pointed</span>
<span class="s0">to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of</span>
<span class="s0">carts.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded</span>
<span class="s0">officer and at once went to meet the major.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May the wounded men stay in our house?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Which one do you want, Ma'am'selle?&quot; said he, screwing up his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes and smiling.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner</span>
<span class="s0">were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her</span>
<span class="s0">handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection-</span>
<span class="s0">as if considering in how far the thing was possible--replied in the</span>
<span class="s0">affirmative.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, why not? They may,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">With a slight inclination of her head, Natasha stepped back</span>
<span class="s0">quickly to Mavra Kuzminichna, who stood talking compassionately to the</span>
<span class="s0">officer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They may. He says they may!&quot; whispered Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostovs' yard,</span>
<span class="s0">and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the</span>
<span class="s0">townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of</span>
<span class="s0">the houses in Povarskaya Street. Natasha was evidently pleased to be</span>
<span class="s0">dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life.</span>
<span class="s0">She and Mavra Kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as</span>
<span class="s0">possible into their yard.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your Papa must be told, though,&quot; said Mavra Kuzminichna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can</span>
<span class="s0">move into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if</span>
<span class="s0">we put them into the wing, the men's room, or the nurse's room, we</span>
<span class="s0">must ask permission.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I'll ask.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the</span>
<span class="s0">half-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell of</span>
<span class="s0">vinegar and Hoffman's drops.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are you asleep, Mamma?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, what sleep-?&quot; said the countess, waking up just as she was</span>
<span class="s0">dropping into a doze.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma darling!&quot; said Natasha, kneeling by her mother and bringing</span>
<span class="s0">her face close to her mother's, &quot;I am sorry, forgive me, I'll never do</span>
<span class="s0">it again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna has sent me: they have</span>
<span class="s0">brought some wounded here--officers. Will you let them come? They have</span>
<span class="s0">nowhere to go. I knew you'd let them come!&quot; she said quickly all in</span>
<span class="s0">one breath.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What officers? Whom have they brought? I don't understand</span>
<span class="s0">anything about it,&quot; said the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I knew you'd give permission... so I'll tell them,&quot; and, having</span>
<span class="s0">kissed her mother, Natasha got up and went to the door.</span>

<span class="s0">In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We've stayed too long!&quot; said the count with involuntary vexation.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The Club is closed and the police are leaving.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Papa, is it all right--I've invited some of the wounded into the</span>
<span class="s0">house?&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course it is,&quot; he answered absently. &quot;That's not the point. I</span>
<span class="s0">beg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow we must go, go, go!....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the</span>
<span class="s0">servants.</span>

<span class="s0">At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had</span>
<span class="s0">heard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and</span>
<span class="s0">that though Rostopchin's broadsheet had said that he would sound a</span>
<span class="s0">call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already</span>
<span class="s0">been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and</span>
<span class="s0">that there would be a big battle there.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess looked with timid horror at her son's eager, excited</span>
<span class="s0">face as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his</span>
<span class="s0">not going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the</span>
<span class="s0">impending engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the</span>
<span class="s0">fatherland--something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which</span>
<span class="s0">there would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and</span>
<span class="s0">so, hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her</span>
<span class="s0">as their protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after</span>
<span class="s0">dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take</span>
<span class="s0">her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman's</span>
<span class="s0">involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm,</span>
<span class="s0">said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very</span>
<span class="s0">night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the</span>
<span class="s0">countess' fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit</span>
<span class="s0">dealer's in Myasnitski Street. When returning by that street she had</span>
<span class="s0">been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the</span>
<span class="s0">shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the</span>
<span class="s0">cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels</span>
<span class="s0">at the drink store, having received orders to do so.</span>

<span class="s0">After dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their</span>
<span class="s0">departure. The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing</span>
<span class="s0">from the yard to the house and back again, shouting confused</span>
<span class="s0">instructions to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more.</span>
<span class="s0">Petya directed things in the yard. Sonya, owing to the count's</span>
<span class="s0">contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The</span>
<span class="s0">servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set</span>
<span class="s0">to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing</span>
<span class="s0">was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and</span>
<span class="s0">did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded</span>
<span class="s0">obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed</span>
<span class="s0">her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first</span>
<span class="s0">exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her</span>
<span class="s0">authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable</span>
<span class="s0">Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost</span>
<span class="s0">full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much</span>
<span class="s0">china standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from</span>
<span class="s0">the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to</span>
<span class="s0">fetch it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, wait a bit--we'll pack everything into these,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You can't, Miss, we have tried to,&quot; said the butler's assistant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, wait a minute, please.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates</span>
<span class="s0">wrapped in paper.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The dishes must go in here among the carpets,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, it's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three</span>
<span class="s0">cases,&quot; said the butler's assistant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, wait, please!&quot; And Natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out</span>
<span class="s0">the things. &quot;These aren't needed,&quot; said she, putting aside some plates</span>
<span class="s0">of Kiev ware. &quot;These--yes, these must go among the carpets,&quot; she said,</span>
<span class="s0">referring to the Saxony china dishes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't, Natasha! Leave it alone! We'll get it all packed,&quot; urged</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya reproachfully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a young lady she is!&quot; remarked the major-domo.</span>

<span class="s0">But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began</span>
<span class="s0">quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and</span>
<span class="s0">unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had</span>
<span class="s0">been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned</span>
<span class="s0">out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all</span>
<span class="s0">been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases.</span>
<span class="s0">Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A</span>
<span class="s0">few more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on</span>
<span class="s0">having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler's</span>
<span class="s0">assistant and Petya--whom she had drawn into the business of</span>
<span class="s0">packing--press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's enough, Natasha,&quot; said Sonya. &quot;I see you were right, but</span>
<span class="s0">just take out the top one.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I won't!&quot; cried Natasha, with one hand bolding back the hair that</span>
<span class="s0">hung over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down</span>
<span class="s0">the carpets. &quot;Now press, Petya! Press, Vasilich, press hard!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">cried.</span>

<span class="s0">The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping her hands,</span>
<span class="s0">screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only</span>
<span class="s0">lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted</span>
<span class="s0">her completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came</span>
<span class="s0">to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it</span>
<span class="s0">might be corded up. Thanks to Natasha's directions the work now went</span>
<span class="s0">on expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most</span>
<span class="s0">valuable packed as compactly as possible.</span>

<span class="s0">But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could</span>
<span class="s0">not get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the</span>
<span class="s0">count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing.</span>

<span class="s0">That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, and</span>
<span class="s0">Mavra Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought</span>
<span class="s0">into the Rostovs' yard. Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was a very</span>
<span class="s0">important man. He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised</span>
<span class="s0">hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the</span>
<span class="s0">driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">followed the carriage in a cart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house</span>
<span class="s0">will be empty,&quot; said the old woman to the old attendant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, perhaps,&quot; said he with a sigh. &quot;We don't expect to get him</span>
<span class="s0">home alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it's a long</span>
<span class="s0">way from here, and there's nobody living in it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty of everything in the</span>
<span class="s0">master's house. Come in,&quot; said Mavra Kuzminichna. &quot;Is he very ill?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">The attendant made a hopeless gesture.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We don't expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right!&quot; said the doctor.</span>

<span class="s0">The old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook his</span>
<span class="s0">head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and</span>
<span class="s0">stopped beside Mavra Kuzminichna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O, Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; she murmured.</span>

<span class="s0">She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The masters won't object...&quot; she said.</span>

<span class="s0">But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took</span>
<span class="s0">him into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame</span>
<span class="s0">Schoss'.</span>

<span class="s0">This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">Moscow's last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a</span>
<span class="s0">Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just</span>
<span class="s0">as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the</span>
<span class="s0">city.</span>

<span class="s0">Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow--the</span>
<span class="s0">rabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An</span>
<span class="s0">enormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with</span>
<span class="s0">whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone</span>
<span class="s0">early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the</span>
<span class="s0">public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state</span>
<span class="s0">of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept</span>
<span class="s0">rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling,</span>
<span class="s0">so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable</span>
<span class="s0">goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they</span>
<span class="s0">carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each,</span>
<span class="s0">and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.</span>

<span class="s0">In the Rostovs' staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of</span>
<span class="s0">former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs</span>
<span class="s0">the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue</span>
<span class="s0">disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the</span>
<span class="s0">value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come</span>
<span class="s0">in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be</span>
<span class="s0">extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for</span>
<span class="s0">them. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on</span>
<span class="s0">the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of</span>
<span class="s0">September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs' and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating</span>
<span class="s0">the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo</span>
<span class="s0">to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention</span>
<span class="s0">the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was</span>
<span class="s0">evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to</span>
<span class="s0">refuse another, or all the carts and one's own carriages as well.</span>
<span class="s0">Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general</span>
<span class="s0">catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one's own family. So</span>
<span class="s0">thought the major-domo on his master's behalf.</span>

<span class="s0">On waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom softly,</span>
<span class="s0">so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward</span>
<span class="s0">morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In</span>
<span class="s0">the yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front</span>
<span class="s0">porch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly</span>
<span class="s0">and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count</span>
<span class="s0">the major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go</span>
<span class="s0">away.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?&quot; asked the count, and stroking</span>
<span class="s0">his bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the</span>
<span class="s0">orderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We can harness at once, your excellency.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, that's right. As soon as the countess wakes we'll be off, God</span>
<span class="s0">willing! What is it, gentlemen?&quot; he added, turning to the officer.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Are you staying in my house?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Count, be so good as to allow me... for God's sake, to get into</span>
<span class="s0">some corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I</span>
<span class="s0">shall be all right on a loaded cart...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same</span>
<span class="s0">request on behalf of his master.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes, yes, yes!&quot; said the count hastily. &quot;I shall be very</span>
<span class="s0">pleased, very pleased. Vasilich, you'll see to it. Just unload one</span>
<span class="s0">or two carts. Well, what of it... do what's necessary...&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">count, muttering some indefinite order.</span>

<span class="s0">But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the</span>
<span class="s0">officer's face had already sealed the order. The count looked around</span>
<span class="s0">him. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded</span>
<span class="s0">officers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at</span>
<span class="s0">the count and moving toward the porch.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Please step into the gallery, your excellency,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">major-domo. &quot;What are your orders about the pictures?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to</span>
<span class="s0">refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,&quot; he added</span>
<span class="s0">in a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.</span>

<span class="s0">At nine o'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, who</span>
<span class="s0">had been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed a</span>
<span class="s0">sort of chief gendarme's duty for her, came to say that Madame</span>
<span class="s0">Schoss was much offended and the young ladies' summer dresses could</span>
<span class="s0">not be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame</span>
<span class="s0">Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its</span>
<span class="s0">cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken</span>
<span class="s0">out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the</span>
<span class="s0">simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them.</span>
<span class="s0">The countess sent for her husband.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer</span>
<span class="s0">came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are</span>
<span class="s0">things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to</span>
<span class="s0">them!... Really now, in our own yard--we asked them in ourselves and</span>
<span class="s0">there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let</span>
<span class="s0">them be taken... where's the hurry?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money</span>
<span class="s0">matters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of</span>
<span class="s0">news of something detrimental to the children's interests, such as the</span>
<span class="s0">building of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a</span>
<span class="s0">private theater or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose</span>
<span class="s0">anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do</span>
<span class="s0">so.</span>

<span class="s0">She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are</span>
<span class="s0">getting nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our-</span>
<span class="s0">all the children's property! You said yourself that we have a</span>
<span class="s0">hundred thousand rubles' worth of things in the house. I don't</span>
<span class="s0">consent, my dear, I don't! Do as you please! It's the government's</span>
<span class="s0">business to look after the wounded; they know that. Look at the</span>
<span class="s0">Lopukhins opposite, they cleared out everything two days ago. That's</span>
<span class="s0">what other people do. It's only we who are such fools. If you have</span>
<span class="s0">no pity on me, have some for the children.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without</span>
<span class="s0">replying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Papa, what are you doing that for?&quot; asked Natasha, who had followed</span>
<span class="s0">him into her mother's room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing! What business is it of yours?&quot; muttered the count angrily.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I heard,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Why does Mamma object?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What business is it of yours?&quot; cried the count.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha stepped up to the window and pondered.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Papa! Here's Berg coming to see us,&quot; said she, looking out of the</span>
<span class="s0">window.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">Berg, the Rostovs' son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the</span>
<span class="s0">orders of Vladimir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and</span>
<span class="s0">agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the</span>
<span class="s0">assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army.</span>

<span class="s0">On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.</span>

<span class="s0">He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone</span>
<span class="s0">in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something</span>
<span class="s0">to do there. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence</span>
<span class="s0">for family and domestic reasons.</span>

<span class="s0">Berg drove up to his father-in-law's house in his spruce little trap</span>
<span class="s0">with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He</span>
<span class="s0">looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to</span>
<span class="s0">the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.</span>

<span class="s0">From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha and Sonya, and hastened to inquire after &quot;Mamma's&quot; health.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Health, at a time like this?&quot; said the count. &quot;Come, tell us the</span>
<span class="s0">news! Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Berg. &quot;The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the</span>
<span class="s0">leaders, so to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what</span>
<span class="s0">is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic</span>
<span class="s0">spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they--which</span>
<span class="s0">it&quot; (he corrected himself) &quot;has shown or displayed in the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">the twenty-sixth--there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell</span>
<span class="s0">you, Papa&quot; (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard</span>
<span class="s0">speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have</span>
<span class="s0">struck his breast at the words &quot;Russian army&quot;), &quot;I tell you frankly</span>
<span class="s0">that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or</span>
<span class="s0">anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes,</span>
<span class="s0">those exploits of antique valor,&quot; he went on rapidly. &quot;General Barclay</span>
<span class="s0">de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can</span>
<span class="s0">assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he</span>
<span class="s0">had heard those days. Natasha watched him with an intent gaze that</span>
<span class="s0">confused him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer</span>
<span class="s0">to some question.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors</span>
<span class="s0">cannot be imagined or adequately praised!&quot; said Berg, glancing round</span>
<span class="s0">at Natasha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her</span>
<span class="s0">intent look with a smile. &quot;'Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in</span>
<span class="s0">the hearts of her sons!' Isn't it so, Papa?&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary</span>
<span class="s0">and dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her</span>
<span class="s0">hand, asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to</span>
<span class="s0">side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad</span>
<span class="s0">times for every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still</span>
<span class="s0">time to get away....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I can't think what the servants are about,&quot; said the countess,</span>
<span class="s0">turning to her husband. &quot;I have just been told that nothing is ready</span>
<span class="s0">yet. Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mitenka at such</span>
<span class="s0">times. There won't be any end to it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained</span>
<span class="s0">himself. He got up from his chair and went to the door.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose</span>
<span class="s0">and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and</span>
<span class="s0">significantly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hm...&quot; said the count, and stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was driving past Yusupov's house just now,&quot; said Berg with a</span>
<span class="s0">laugh, &quot;when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I</span>
<span class="s0">wouldn't buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and</span>
<span class="s0">there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear</span>
<span class="s0">Vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">(At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable</span>
<span class="s0">domestic arrangements.) &quot;And it's such a beauty! It pulls out and</span>
<span class="s0">has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear Vera has long wanted</span>
<span class="s0">one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so many of those</span>
<span class="s0">peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will pay the man</span>
<span class="s0">well, and...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count frowned and coughed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ask the countess, I don't give orders.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If it's inconvenient, please don't,&quot; said Berg. &quot;Only I so wanted</span>
<span class="s0">it, for dear Vera's sake.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the</span>
<span class="s0">devil...&quot; cried the old count. &quot;My head's in a whirl!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And he left the room. The countess began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!&quot; said Berg.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha left the room with her father and, as if finding it</span>
<span class="s0">difficult to reach some decision, first followed him and then ran</span>
<span class="s0">downstairs.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the</span>
<span class="s0">servants who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still</span>
<span class="s0">standing in the yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded</span>
<span class="s0">officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know what it's about?&quot; Petya asked Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling</span>
<span class="s0">about. She did not answer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded,&quot; said Petya. &quot;Vasilich told me. I consider...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I consider,&quot; Natasha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry</span>
<span class="s0">face to Petya, &quot;I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I</span>
<span class="s0">don't know what. Are we despicable Germans?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening</span>
<span class="s0">and letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed</span>
<span class="s0">headlong up the stairs.</span>

<span class="s0">Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the</span>
<span class="s0">respectful attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was</span>
<span class="s0">pacing up and down the room, when Natasha, her face distorted by</span>
<span class="s0">anger, burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid</span>
<span class="s0">steps.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's horrid! It's abominable!&quot; she screamed. &quot;You can't possibly</span>
<span class="s0">have ordered it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The</span>
<span class="s0">count stood still at the window and listened.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, it's impossible: see what is going on in the yard!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">cried. &quot;They will be left!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's the matter with you? Who are 'they'? What do you want?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, the wounded! It's impossible, Mamma. It's monstrous!... No,</span>
<span class="s0">Mamma darling, it's not the thing. Please forgive me, darling....</span>
<span class="s0">Mamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is</span>
<span class="s0">going on in the yard... Mamma!... It's impossible!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.</span>
<span class="s0">Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for</span>
<span class="s0">her mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did</span>
<span class="s0">not turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?&quot; she said, not</span>
<span class="s0">surrendering at once.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma, darling, forgive me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her</span>
<span class="s0">husband.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don't understand</span>
<span class="s0">about it,&quot; said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,&quot; muttered the count</span>
<span class="s0">through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide</span>
<span class="s0">her look of shame on his breast.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...&quot; asked Natasha. &quot;We will</span>
<span class="s0">still take all the most necessary things.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The count nodded affirmatively, and Natasha, at the rapid pace at</span>
<span class="s0">which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to</span>
<span class="s0">the anteroom and downstairs into the yard.</span>

<span class="s0">The servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the</span>
<span class="s0">strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his</span>
<span class="s0">wife's name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood</span>
<span class="s0">that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and</span>
<span class="s0">zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour</span>
<span class="s0">before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should</span>
<span class="s0">be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the</span>
<span class="s0">only thing to do.</span>

<span class="s0">The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner,</span>
<span class="s0">set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the</span>
<span class="s0">carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood</span>
<span class="s0">with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to</span>
<span class="s0">be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men</span>
<span class="s0">began to come into the Rostovs' yard. Many of the wounded asked them</span>
<span class="s0">not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the</span>
<span class="s0">things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be</span>
<span class="s0">arrested. It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the</span>
<span class="s0">things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and</span>
<span class="s0">mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay</span>
<span class="s0">about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding</span>
<span class="s0">possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have</span>
<span class="s0">another and yet another cart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We can take four more men,&quot; said the steward. &quot;They can have my</span>
<span class="s0">trap, or else what is to become of them?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let them have my wardrobe cart,&quot; said the countess. &quot;Dunyasha can</span>
<span class="s0">go with me in the carriage.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from</span>
<span class="s0">a house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was</span>
<span class="s0">bright and animated. Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement</span>
<span class="s0">such as she had not known for a long time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What could we fasten this onto?&quot; asked the servants, trying to</span>
<span class="s0">fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. &quot;We must keep</span>
<span class="s0">at least one cart.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's in it?&quot; asked Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The count's books.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Leave it, Vasilich will put it away. It's not wanted.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where</span>
<span class="s0">Count Peter could sit.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On the box. You'll sit on the box, won't you, Petya?&quot; cried</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was</span>
<span class="s0">quite different from Natasha's. She was putting away the things that</span>
<span class="s0">had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess</span>
<span class="s0">wished, and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages,</span>
<span class="s0">packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door.</span>
<span class="s0">One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.</span>

<span class="s0">The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sonya's</span>
<span class="s0">attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she</span>
<span class="s0">was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that</span>
<span class="s0">stood at the entrance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whose caleche is that?&quot; she inquired, leaning out of the carriage</span>
<span class="s0">window.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, didn't you know, Miss?&quot; replied the maid. &quot;The wounded prince:</span>
<span class="s0">he spent the night in our house and is going with us.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But who is it? What's his name?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's our intended that was--Prince Bolkonski himself! They say he</span>
<span class="s0">is dying,&quot; replied the maid with a sigh.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,</span>
<span class="s0">tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was</span>
<span class="s0">pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to</span>
<span class="s0">assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before</span>
<span class="s0">starting. Natasha was not in the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma,&quot; said Sonya, &quot;Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is</span>
<span class="s0">going with us.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's arm,</span>
<span class="s0">glanced around.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha?&quot; she murmured.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.</span>
<span class="s0">They knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen if she</span>
<span class="s0">heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You say he is dying?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya nodded.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The ways of God are past finding out!&quot; she thought, feeling that</span>
<span class="s0">the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all</span>
<span class="s0">that was now taking place.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's the matter?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, as with animated face she ran into the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing,&quot; answered the countess. &quot;If everything is ready let us</span>
<span class="s0">start.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face.</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya embraced Natasha and kissed her.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked at her inquiringly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it? What has happened?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing... No...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it something very bad for me? What is it?&quot; persisted Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">with her quick intuition.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss,</span>
<span class="s0">Mavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having</span>
<span class="s0">closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments</span>
<span class="s0">silently seated without looking at one another.</span>

<span class="s0">The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed</span>
<span class="s0">himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count</span>
<span class="s0">embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted</span>
<span class="s0">their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting</span>
<span class="s0">words. The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on</span>
<span class="s0">her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging</span>
<span class="s0">on the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition</span>
<span class="s0">was connected, were being taken with them.)</span>

<span class="s0">In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with</span>
<span class="s0">swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and</span>
<span class="s0">with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining</span>
<span class="s0">behind.</span>

<span class="s0">As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put</span>
<span class="s0">in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on</span>
<span class="s0">each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help</span>
<span class="s0">the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the</span>
<span class="s0">house to the carriages, the caleche, the phaeton, and back again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They always will forget everything!&quot; said the countess. &quot;Don't</span>
<span class="s0">you know I can't sit like that?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an</span>
<span class="s0">aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange</span>
<span class="s0">the seat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, those servants!&quot; said the count, swaying his head.</span>

<span class="s0">Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to</span>
<span class="s0">drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as</span>
<span class="s0">glance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years'</span>
<span class="s0">experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, &quot;Be</span>
<span class="s0">off, in God's name!&quot; would be given him: and he knew that even when it</span>
<span class="s0">was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back</span>
<span class="s0">to fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he</span>
<span class="s0">would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of</span>
<span class="s0">the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully</span>
<span class="s0">down the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what</span>
<span class="s0">would happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the</span>
<span class="s0">near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and</span>
<span class="s0">champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were</span>
<span class="s0">folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a</span>
<span class="s0">traveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to</span>
<span class="s0">say. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself.</span>
<span class="s0">The postilion and all the other servants did the same. &quot;Off, in</span>
<span class="s0">God's name!&quot; said Efim, putting on his hat. &quot;Start!&quot; The postilion</span>
<span class="s0">started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the</span>
<span class="s0">high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman</span>
<span class="s0">sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed</span>
<span class="s0">out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted</span>
<span class="s0">in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In</span>
<span class="s0">the carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as</span>
<span class="s0">they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.</span>

<span class="s0">Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting</span>
<span class="s0">in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly</span>
<span class="s0">receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned</span>
<span class="s0">out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the</span>
<span class="s0">long train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line</span>
<span class="s0">she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew's caleche. She did</span>
<span class="s0">not know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her</span>
<span class="s0">eyes sought that caleche. She knew it was right in front.</span>

<span class="s0">In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets</span>
<span class="s0">came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs', and</span>
<span class="s0">as they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts</span>
<span class="s0">formed two rows abreast.</span>

<span class="s0">As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was</span>
<span class="s0">inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking</span>
<span class="s0">past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who? Who?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!&quot; said Natasha, putting her</span>
<span class="s0">head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a</span>
<span class="s0">coachman's long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was</span>
<span class="s0">evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the</span>
<span class="s0">arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced,</span>
<span class="s0">beardless old man in a frieze coat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with a</span>
<span class="s0">queer-looking old boy. Really,&quot; said Natasha, &quot;look, look!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, it's not he. How can you talk such nonsense?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma,&quot; screamed Natasha, &quot;I'll stake my head it's he! I assure</span>
<span class="s0">you! Stop, stop!&quot; she cried to the coachman.</span>

<span class="s0">But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street</span>
<span class="s0">came more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at</span>
<span class="s0">to move on and not block the way.</span>

<span class="s0">In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs all saw Pierre--or someone extraordinarily like him--in a</span>
<span class="s0">coachman's coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious</span>
<span class="s0">face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That</span>
<span class="s0">old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at</span>
<span class="s0">them, and respectfully touching Pierre's elbow said something to him</span>
<span class="s0">and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought,</span>
<span class="s0">could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood</span>
<span class="s0">and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly</span>
<span class="s0">toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember</span>
<span class="s0">something and stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha's face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical</span>
<span class="s0">kindliness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is</span>
<span class="s0">wonderful!&quot; she cried, holding out her hand to him. &quot;What are you</span>
<span class="s0">doing? Why are you like this?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he</span>
<span class="s0">walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is the matter, Count?&quot; asked the countess in a surprised and</span>
<span class="s0">commiserating tone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What? Why? Don't ask me,&quot; said Pierre, and looked round at</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha whose radiant, happy expression--of which he was conscious</span>
<span class="s0">without looking at her--filled him with enchantment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Are you remaining in Moscow, then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre hesitated.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In Moscow?&quot; he said in a questioning tone. &quot;Yes, in Moscow.</span>
<span class="s0">Goodby!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, if only I were a man? I'd certainly stay with you. How</span>
<span class="s0">splendid!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Mamma, if you'll let me, I'll stay!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something,</span>
<span class="s0">but the countess interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You were at the battle, we heard.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I was,&quot; Pierre answered. &quot;There will be another battle</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow...&quot; he began, but Natasha interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like</span>
<span class="s0">yourself....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! I don't know myself. Tomorrow...</span>
<span class="s0">But no! Good-by, good-by!&quot; he muttered. &quot;It's an awful time!&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming</span>
<span class="s0">at him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been</span>
<span class="s0">living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdeev. This is</span>
<span class="s0">how it happened.</span>

<span class="s0">When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his</span>
<span class="s0">interview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some time make out</span>
<span class="s0">where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that</span>
<span class="s0">among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Helene,</span>
<span class="s0">he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and</span>
<span class="s0">hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything</span>
<span class="s0">was now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces,</span>
<span class="s0">that nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was</span>
<span class="s0">no escape from this position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to</span>
<span class="s0">himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then</span>
<span class="s0">rose, went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the</span>
<span class="s0">crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a book. His</span>
<span class="s0">major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had</span>
<span class="s0">brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if</span>
<span class="s0">only for a minute, and that someone from Bazdeev's widow had called to</span>
<span class="s0">ask Pierre to take charge of her husband's books, as she herself was</span>
<span class="s0">leaving for the country.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say</span>
<span class="s0">I will come directly,&quot; Pierre replied to the major-domo.</span>

<span class="s0">But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat</span>
<span class="s0">which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other</span>
<span class="s0">door. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole</span>
<span class="s0">length of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his</span>
<span class="s0">forehead with both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The</span>
<span class="s0">hall porter was standing at the front door. From the landing where</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back</span>
<span class="s0">entrance. He went down that staircase and out into the yard. No one</span>
<span class="s0">had seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as soon as</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter</span>
<span class="s0">noticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being</span>
<span class="s0">looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in</span>
<span class="s0">order not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went</span>
<span class="s0">down the street.</span>

<span class="s0">Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph</span>
<span class="s0">Bazdeev's books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.</span>


<span class="s0">He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the</span>
<span class="s0">Patriarch's Ponds, where the widow Bazdeev's house was.</span>

<span class="s0">Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that</span>
<span class="s0">were making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing</span>
<span class="s0">his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school,</span>
<span class="s0">began to talk to his driver.</span>

<span class="s0">The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the</span>
<span class="s0">Kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the</span>
<span class="s0">Three Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there.</span>

<span class="s0">Having reached the Patriarch's Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs'</span>
<span class="s0">house, where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the</span>
<span class="s0">gate. Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at</span>
<span class="s0">Torzhok five years before with Joseph Bazdeev, came out in answer to</span>
<span class="s0">his knock.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;At home?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danilovna has gone to</span>
<span class="s0">the Torzhok estate with the children, your excellency.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Be so good as to step in. Makar Alexeevich, the brother of my</span>
<span class="s0">late master--may the kingdom of heaven be his--has remained here,</span>
<span class="s0">but he is in a weak state as you know,&quot; said the old servant.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre knew that Makar Alexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev's half-insane</span>
<span class="s0">brother and a hard drinker.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in...&quot; said Pierre and entered the</span>
<span class="s0">house.</span>

<span class="s0">A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown</span>
<span class="s0">and with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your</span>
<span class="s0">honor sees,&quot; said Gerasim. &quot;Will you step into the study?&quot; Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">nodded. &quot;As it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia</span>
<span class="s0">Danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to</span>
<span class="s0">have the books.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such</span>
<span class="s0">trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime. The room, dusty and</span>
<span class="s0">untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier.</span>

<span class="s0">Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the</span>
<span class="s0">manuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most</span>
<span class="s0">important, the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic</span>
<span class="s0">Scotch Acts with Bazdeev's notes and explanations. He sat down at</span>
<span class="s0">the dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts before</span>
<span class="s0">him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and</span>
<span class="s0">resting his head on his hand sank into meditation.</span>

<span class="s0">Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre always sitting in the same attitude.</span>

<span class="s0">More than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of making</span>
<span class="s0">a slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did</span>
<span class="s0">not hear him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes!&quot; said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. &quot;Look</span>
<span class="s0">here,&quot; he added, taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking</span>
<span class="s0">down at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, &quot;I say, do</span>
<span class="s0">you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We heard so,&quot; replied the man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; replied Gerasim. &quot;Will you have something to</span>
<span class="s0">eat?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a</span>
<span class="s0">pistol,&quot; said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; said Gerasim after thinking for a moment.</span>

<span class="s0">All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor's</span>
<span class="s0">study, and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to</span>
<span class="s0">another and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made</span>
<span class="s0">up for him there.</span>

<span class="s0">Gerasim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange</span>
<span class="s0">things, accepted Pierre's taking up his residence in the house without</span>
<span class="s0">surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same</span>
<span class="s0">evening--without even asking himself what they were wanted for--he</span>
<span class="s0">procured a coachman's coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him</span>
<span class="s0">the pistol next day. Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening</span>
<span class="s0">shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and</span>
<span class="s0">looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward</span>
<span class="s0">him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and</span>
<span class="s0">angry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the</span>
<span class="s0">coachman's coat which Gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected</span>
<span class="s0">by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the</span>
<span class="s0">Sukharev market that he met the Rostovs.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">Kutuzov's order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazan road was</span>
<span class="s0">issued at night on the first of September.</span>

<span class="s0">The first troops started at once, and during the night they</span>
<span class="s0">marched slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those</span>
<span class="s0">nearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the</span>
<span class="s0">opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless</span>
<span class="s0">masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind, and an</span>
<span class="s0">unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. They all rushed forward</span>
<span class="s0">to the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and the boats. Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">By ten o'clock in the morning of the second of September, only the</span>
<span class="s0">rear guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb, where they had ample</span>
<span class="s0">room. The main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.</span>

<span class="s0">At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny Hill looking at</span>
<span class="s0">the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to</span>
<span class="s0">the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodino to the</span>
<span class="s0">entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,</span>
<span class="s0">memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that</span>
<span class="s0">always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat</span>
<span class="s0">than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear</span>
<span class="s0">atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and</span>
<span class="s0">refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights</span>
<span class="s0">are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and</span>
<span class="s0">delight us continually by falling from the sky.</span>

<span class="s0">At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather</span>
<span class="s0">still held.</span>

<span class="s0">The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the</span>
<span class="s0">Poklonny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens,</span>
<span class="s0">and her churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her</span>
<span class="s0">cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight.</span>

<span class="s0">The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as</span>
<span class="s0">he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious</span>
<span class="s0">and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that</span>
<span class="s0">has no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full</span>
<span class="s0">force of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a</span>
<span class="s0">distance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the</span>
<span class="s0">Poklonny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as</span>
<span class="s0">it were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body.</span>

<span class="s0">Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every</span>
<span class="s0">foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the</span>
<span class="s0">mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises, Moscou la sainte.</span>
<span class="s0">La voila done enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il etait temps,&quot;* said he,</span>
<span class="s0">and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before</span>
<span class="s0">him, and summoned Lelorgne d'Ideville, the interpreter.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here</span>
<span class="s0">it is then at last, that famous city. It was high time.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her</span>
<span class="s0">honor,&quot; thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at Smolensk). From</span>
<span class="s0">that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen</span>
<span class="s0">before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had</span>
<span class="s0">seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning</span>
<span class="s0">light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its</span>
<span class="s0">details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But could it be otherwise?&quot; he thought. &quot;Here is this capital at my</span>
<span class="s0">feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In</span>
<span class="s0">what light must I appear to them!&quot; thought he, thinking of his troops.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">reflected, glancing at those near him and at the troops who were</span>
<span class="s0">approaching and forming up. &quot;One word from me, one movement of my</span>
<span class="s0">hand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But my</span>
<span class="s0">clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished. I must be</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimous and truly great. But no, it can't be true that I am in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow,&quot; he suddenly thought. &quot;Yet here she is lying at my feet,</span>
<span class="s0">with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the</span>
<span class="s0">sunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism</span>
<span class="s0">and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy....</span>
<span class="s0">It is just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know him.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">(It seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what was taking</span>
<span class="s0">place lay in the personal struggle between himself and Alexander.)</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;From the height of the Kremlin--yes, there is the Kremlin, yes--I</span>
<span class="s0">will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true</span>
<span class="s0">civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their</span>
<span class="s0">conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do</span>
<span class="s0">not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy</span>
<span class="s0">of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I</span>
<span class="s0">will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not</span>
<span class="s0">wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch.</span>
<span class="s0">'Boyars,' I will say to them, 'I do not desire war, I desire the peace</span>
<span class="s0">and welfare of all my subjects.' However, I know their presence will</span>
<span class="s0">inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly,</span>
<span class="s0">impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow? Yes, there she lies.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Qu'on m'amene les boyars,&quot;* said he to his suite.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Bring the boyars to me.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the</span>
<span class="s0">boyars.</span>

<span class="s0">Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the</span>
<span class="s0">same place on the Poklonny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to</span>
<span class="s0">the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That</span>
<span class="s0">speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.</span>

<span class="s0">He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended</span>
<span class="s0">to adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for</span>
<span class="s0">assemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and</span>
<span class="s0">his own would mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who</span>
<span class="s0">would win the hearts of the people. Having learned that there were</span>
<span class="s0">many charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he</span>
<span class="s0">would shower favors on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he</span>
<span class="s0">had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must</span>
<span class="s0">be beneficent like the Tsars. And in order finally to touch the hearts</span>
<span class="s0">of the Russians--and being like all Frenchmen unable to imagine</span>
<span class="s0">anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere, ma tendre, ma</span>
<span class="s0">pauvre mere* --he decided that he would place an inscription on all</span>
<span class="s0">these establishments in large letters: &quot;This establishment is</span>
<span class="s0">dedicated to my dear mother.&quot; Or no, it should be simply: Maison de ma</span>
<span class="s0">Mere,*[2] he concluded. &quot;But am I really in Moscow? Yes, here it</span>
<span class="s0">lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in</span>
<span class="s0">appearing?&quot; he wondered.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;My dear, my tender, my poor mother.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">*[2] &quot;House of my Mother.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in</span>
<span class="s0">whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite.</span>
<span class="s0">Those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow was empty, that everyone had left it. The faces of those who</span>
<span class="s0">were not conferring together were pale and perturbed. They were not</span>
<span class="s0">alarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned by its</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the question how to</span>
<span class="s0">tell the Emperor--without putting him in the terrible position of</span>
<span class="s0">appearing ridiculous--that he had been awaiting the boyars so long</span>
<span class="s0">in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no one</span>
<span class="s0">else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped</span>
<span class="s0">together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the</span>
<span class="s0">truth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He will have to be told, all the same,&quot; said some gentlemen of</span>
<span class="s0">the suite. &quot;But, gentlemen...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating</span>
<span class="s0">upon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before</span>
<span class="s0">the outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from</span>
<span class="s0">under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it's impossible...&quot; declared the gentlemen of the suite,</span>
<span class="s0">shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word-</span>
<span class="s0">le ridicule...</span>

<span class="s0">At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor's</span>
<span class="s0">instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too</span>
<span class="s0">long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with</span>
<span class="s0">his hand. A single report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops,</span>
<span class="s0">who were already spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into</span>
<span class="s0">the city through Tver, Kaluga, and Dorogomilov gates. Faster and</span>
<span class="s0">faster, vying with one another, they moved at the double or at a trot,</span>
<span class="s0">vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air</span>
<span class="s0">ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts.</span>

<span class="s0">Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as</span>
<span class="s0">far as the Dorogomilov gate, but there again stopped and,</span>
<span class="s0">dismounting from his horse, paced for a long time by the</span>
<span class="s0">Kammer-Kollezski rampart, awaiting the deputation.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XX</span>

<span class="s0">Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a</span>
<span class="s0">fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was</span>
<span class="s0">empty. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.</span>

<span class="s0">In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance</span>
<span class="s0">it seems as much alive as other hives.</span>

<span class="s0">The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the</span>
<span class="s0">midday sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it</span>
<span class="s0">smells of honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same</span>
<span class="s0">way. But one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no</span>
<span class="s0">longer any life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the</span>
<span class="s0">smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the</span>
<span class="s0">beekeeper's tap on the wall of the sick hive, instead of the former</span>
<span class="s0">instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their</span>
<span class="s0">abdomens threateningly compressed, and producing by the rapid</span>
<span class="s0">vibration of their wings an aerial living sound, the only reply is a</span>
<span class="s0">disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive. From</span>
<span class="s0">the alighting board, instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell</span>
<span class="s0">of honey and venom, and the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor</span>
<span class="s0">of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are</span>
<span class="s0">no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and</span>
<span class="s0">ready to die in defense of the hive. There is no longer the measured</span>
<span class="s0">quiet sound of throbbing activity, like the sound of boiling water,</span>
<span class="s0">but diverse discordant sounds of disorder. In and out of the hive long</span>
<span class="s0">black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do</span>
<span class="s0">not sting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly only bees laden with</span>
<span class="s0">honey flew into the hive, and they flew out empty; now they fly out</span>
<span class="s0">laden. The beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in.</span>
<span class="s0">Instead of black, glossy bees--tamed by toil, clinging to one</span>
<span class="s0">another's legs and drawing out the wax, with a ceaseless hum of labor-</span>
<span class="s0">that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive,</span>
<span class="s0">drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions</span>
<span class="s0">on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a neatly glued floor,</span>
<span class="s0">swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings, there is a floor</span>
<span class="s0">littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving their</span>
<span class="s0">legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared away.</span>

<span class="s0">The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the</span>
<span class="s0">super. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the</span>
<span class="s0">combs and keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex</span>
<span class="s0">structures of the combs, but no longer in their former state of</span>
<span class="s0">purity. All is neglected and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and</span>
<span class="s0">stealthily prowling about the combs, and the short home bees,</span>
<span class="s0">shriveled and listless as if they were old, creep slowly about without</span>
<span class="s0">trying to hinder the robbers, having lost all motive and all sense</span>
<span class="s0">of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and butterflies knock awkwardly</span>
<span class="s0">against the walls of the hive in their flight. Here and there among</span>
<span class="s0">the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of bees, by force of habit</span>
<span class="s0">and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with efforts beyond their</span>
<span class="s0">strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing</span>
<span class="s0">why they do it. In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting,</span>
<span class="s0">or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, without themselves</span>
<span class="s0">knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third</span>
<span class="s0">place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack some victim and</span>
<span class="s0">fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops</span>
<span class="s0">from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses.</span>
<span class="s0">The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells.</span>
<span class="s0">In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of</span>
<span class="s0">bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation,</span>
<span class="s0">he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They</span>
<span class="s0">have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had</span>
<span class="s0">guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only a</span>
<span class="s0">few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy's hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are</span>
<span class="s0">dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the</span>
<span class="s0">hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears out its contents</span>
<span class="s0">and burns it clean.</span>

<span class="s0">So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy,</span>
<span class="s0">and morose, paced up and down in front of the Kammer-Kollezski</span>
<span class="s0">rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal,</span>
<span class="s0">observance of the proprieties--a deputation.</span>

<span class="s0">In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people</span>
<span class="s0">aimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of</span>
<span class="s0">what they were doing.</span>

<span class="s0">When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was</span>
<span class="s0">empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently</span>
<span class="s0">continued to walk to and fro.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My carriage!&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into</span>
<span class="s0">the suburb. &quot;Moscow deserted!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;What an incredible</span>
<span class="s0">event!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the</span>
<span class="s0">Dorogomilov suburb.</span>

<span class="s0">The coup de theatre had not come off.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXI</span>


<span class="s0">The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o'clock at</span>
<span class="s0">night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded</span>
<span class="s0">and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving.</span>

<span class="s0">The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at</span>
<span class="s0">the Stone, Moskva, and Yauza bridges.</span>

<span class="s0">While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the</span>
<span class="s0">Kremlin, were thronging the Moskva and the Stone bridges, a great many</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back</span>
<span class="s0">from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church</span>
<span class="s0">of Vasili the Beatified and under the Borovitski gate, back up the</span>
<span class="s0">hill to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily</span>
<span class="s0">take things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap</span>
<span class="s0">sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were</span>
<span class="s0">no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers</span>
<span class="s0">to enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of</span>
<span class="s0">female purchasers--but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though</span>
<span class="s0">without muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently</span>
<span class="s0">making their way out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen</span>
<span class="s0">and their assistants (of whom there were but few) moved about among</span>
<span class="s0">the soldiers quite bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked</span>
<span class="s0">them up again, and themselves carried goods away with the help their</span>
<span class="s0">assistants. On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating</span>
<span class="s0">the muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made</span>
<span class="s0">them, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in the</span>
<span class="s0">shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with</span>
<span class="s0">closely shaven heads. Two officers, one with a scarf over his</span>
<span class="s0">uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an</span>
<span class="s0">overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka Street,</span>
<span class="s0">talking. A third officer galloped up to them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.</span>
<span class="s0">This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where are you off to?... Where?...&quot; he shouted to three infantrymen</span>
<span class="s0">without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were</span>
<span class="s0">slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. &quot;Stop, you rascals!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But how are you going to stop them?&quot; replied another officer.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;There is no getting them together. The army should push on before the</span>
<span class="s0">rest bolt, that's all!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge,</span>
<span class="s0">and don't move. Shouldn't we put a cordon round to prevent the rest</span>
<span class="s0">from running away?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come, go in there and drive them out!&quot; shouted the senior officer.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went</span>
<span class="s0">with him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a</span>
<span class="s0">group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose,</span>
<span class="s0">and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face,</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his</span>
<span class="s0">arms.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your honor!&quot; said he. &quot;Be so good as to protect us! We won't grudge</span>
<span class="s0">trifles, you are welcome to anything--we shall be delighted!</span>
<span class="s0">Pray!... I'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable</span>
<span class="s0">gentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is;</span>
<span class="s0">but what's all this--sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be</span>
<span class="s0">placed if only to let us close the shop....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, what twaddle!&quot; said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;When one's head is gone one doesn't weep for one's hair! Take what</span>
<span class="s0">any of you like!&quot; And flourishing his arm energetically he turned</span>
<span class="s0">sideways to the officer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's all very well for you, Ivan Sidorych, to talk,&quot; said the first</span>
<span class="s0">tradesman angrily. &quot;Please step inside, your honor!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Talk indeed!&quot; cried the thin one. &quot;In my three shops here I have</span>
<span class="s0">a hundred thousand rubles' worth of goods. Can they be saved when</span>
<span class="s0">the army has gone? Eh, what people! 'Against God's might our hands</span>
<span class="s0">can't fight.'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come inside, your honor!&quot; repeated the tradesman, bowing.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's not my business!&quot; he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one</span>
<span class="s0">of the passages.</span>

<span class="s0">From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and</span>
<span class="s0">just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven</span>
<span class="s0">head was flung out violently.</span>

<span class="s0">This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer.</span>
<span class="s0">The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that</span>
<span class="s0">moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the</span>
<span class="s0">Moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it? What is it?&quot; he asked, but his comrade was already</span>
<span class="s0">galloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction from which</span>
<span class="s0">the screams came.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached</span>
<span class="s0">the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the</span>
<span class="s0">bridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces</span>
<span class="s0">among the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two</span>
<span class="s0">horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close</span>
<span class="s0">to the wheels. The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a</span>
<span class="s0">child's chair with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering</span>
<span class="s0">piercing and desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers</span>
<span class="s0">that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to</span>
<span class="s0">the fact that General Ermolov, coming up to the crowd and learning</span>
<span class="s0">that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of</span>
<span class="s0">civilians blocked the bridge, had ordered two guns to be unlimbered</span>
<span class="s0">and made a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd, crushing one</span>
<span class="s0">another, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately,</span>
<span class="s0">had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXII</span>


<span class="s0">Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone</span>
<span class="s0">in the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and</span>
<span class="s0">there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be</span>
<span class="s0">heard. Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely</span>
<span class="s0">heard. The Povarskaya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard</span>
<span class="s0">of the Rostovs' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung</span>
<span class="s0">from the horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great</span>
<span class="s0">drawing room of the house, which had been left with all it</span>
<span class="s0">contained, were two people. They were the yard porter Ignat, and the</span>
<span class="s0">page boy Mishka, Vasilich's grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his</span>
<span class="s0">grandfather. Mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on</span>
<span class="s0">it with one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling</span>
<span class="s0">with satisfaction before the large mirror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Isn't it fine, eh, Uncle Ignat?&quot; said the boy, suddenly beginning</span>
<span class="s0">to strike the keyboard with both hands.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Only fancy!&quot; answered Ignat, surprised at the broadening grin on</span>
<span class="s0">his face in the mirror.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Impudence! Impudence!&quot; they heard behind them the voice of Mavra</span>
<span class="s0">Kuzminichna who had entered silently. &quot;How he's grinning, the fat mug!</span>
<span class="s0">Is that what you're here for? Nothing's cleared away down there and</span>
<span class="s0">Vasilich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Ignat left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the</span>
<span class="s0">room with meekly downcast eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Aunt, I did it gently,&quot; said the boy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll give you something gently, you monkey you!&quot; cried Mavra</span>
<span class="s0">Kuzminichna, raising her arm threateningly. &quot;Go and get the samovar to</span>
<span class="s0">boil for your grandfather.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mavra Kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it,</span>
<span class="s0">and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.</span>

<span class="s0">Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go</span>
<span class="s0">next--to drink tea in the servants' wing with Vasilich, or into the</span>
<span class="s0">storeroom to put away what still lay about.</span>

<span class="s0">She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street.</span>
<span class="s0">Someone stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to</span>
<span class="s0">open it. Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who do you want?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The count--Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And who are you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;An officer, I have to see him,&quot; came the reply in a pleasant,</span>
<span class="s0">well-bred Russian voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Mavra Kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with</span>
<span class="s0">the round face of a Rostov, entered the yard.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Mavra Kuzminichna cordially.</span>

<span class="s0">The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating</span>
<span class="s0">whether to enter or not, clicked his tongue.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, how annoying!&quot; he muttered. &quot;I should have come yesterday....</span>
<span class="s0">Ah, what a pity.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Meanwhile, Mavra Kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically</span>
<span class="s0">examining the familiar Rostov features of the young man's face, his</span>
<span class="s0">tattered coat and trodden-down boots.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What did you want to see the count for?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh well... it can't be helped!&quot; said he in a tone of vexation and</span>
<span class="s0">placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.</span>

<span class="s0">He again paused in indecision.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see,&quot; he suddenly said, &quot;I am a kinsman of the count's and he</span>
<span class="s0">has been very kind to me. As you see&quot; (he glanced with an amused air</span>
<span class="s0">and good-natured smile at his coat and boots) &quot;my things are worn</span>
<span class="s0">out and I have no money, so I was going to ask the count...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mavra Kuzminichna did not let him finish.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,</span>
<span class="s0">hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the</span>
<span class="s0">servants' quarters.</span>

<span class="s0">While Mavra Kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked</span>
<span class="s0">about the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a</span>
<span class="s0">faint smile on his lips. &quot;What a pity I've missed Uncle! What a nice</span>
<span class="s0">old woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the</span>
<span class="s0">nearest way to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near</span>
<span class="s0">the Rogozhski gate?&quot; thought he. Just then Mavra Kuzminichna</span>
<span class="s0">appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet</span>
<span class="s0">resolute look, carrying a rolled-up check kerchief in her hand.</span>
<span class="s0">While still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and</span>
<span class="s0">took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed</span>
<span class="s0">it to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of</span>
<span class="s0">course... but as it is...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Mavra Kuzminichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not</span>
<span class="s0">decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If the count had been at home...&quot; Mavra Kuzminichna went on</span>
<span class="s0">apologetically. &quot;Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said she, bowing as she saw him out.</span>

<span class="s0">Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer</span>
<span class="s0">ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yauza</span>
<span class="s0">bridge to overtake his regiment.</span>

<span class="s0">But Mavra Kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with</span>
<span class="s0">moist eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected</span>
<span class="s0">flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIII</span>


<span class="s0">From an unfinished house on the Varvarka, the ground floor of</span>
<span class="s0">which was a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches</span>
<span class="s0">round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands.</span>
<span class="s0">Tipsy and perspiring, with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were</span>
<span class="s0">all laboriously singing some song or other. They were singing</span>
<span class="s0">discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not</span>
<span class="s0">because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were</span>
<span class="s0">drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue</span>
<span class="s0">coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight</span>
<span class="s0">nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin,</span>
<span class="s0">compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently</span>
<span class="s0">possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and</span>
<span class="s0">solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with</span>
<span class="s0">the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out</span>
<span class="s0">his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he</span>
<span class="s0">always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it</span>
<span class="s0">were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing</span>
<span class="s0">should be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and</span>
<span class="s0">fighting and blows in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his</span>
<span class="s0">arm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stop it!&quot; he exclaimed peremptorily. &quot;There's a fight, lads!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">And, still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.</span>

<span class="s0">The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the</span>
<span class="s0">leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning,</span>
<span class="s0">had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this</span>
<span class="s0">had had drink served them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring</span>
<span class="s0">smithy, hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it</span>
<span class="s0">to have been broken into, wished to force their way in too and a fight</span>
<span class="s0">in the porch had resulted.</span>

<span class="s0">The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when</span>
<span class="s0">the workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern</span>
<span class="s0">keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.</span>

<span class="s0">Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the</span>
<span class="s0">publican with his chest.</span>

<span class="s0">The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the</span>
<span class="s0">face and cried wildly: &quot;They're fighting us, lads!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised</span>
<span class="s0">face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: &quot;Police! Murder!...</span>
<span class="s0">They've killed a man, lads!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death--killed!...&quot; screamed a</span>
<span class="s0">woman coming out of a gate close by.</span>

<span class="s0">A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Haven't you robbed people enough--taking their last shirts?&quot; said a</span>
<span class="s0">voice addressing the publican. &quot;What have you killed a man for, you</span>
<span class="s0">thief?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from</span>
<span class="s0">the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he</span>
<span class="s0">ought to fight now.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Murderer!&quot; he shouted suddenly to the publican. &quot;Bind him, lads!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I daresay you would like to bind me!&quot; shouted the publican, pushing</span>
<span class="s0">away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head</span>
<span class="s0">he flung it on the ground.</span>

<span class="s0">As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the</span>
<span class="s0">workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know the law very well, mates! I'll take the matter to the</span>
<span class="s0">captain of police. You think I won't get to him? Robbery is not</span>
<span class="s0">permitted to anybody now a days!&quot; shouted the publican, picking up his</span>
<span class="s0">cap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come along then! Come along then!&quot; the publican and the tall</span>
<span class="s0">young fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the</span>
<span class="s0">street together.</span>

<span class="s0">The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and</span>
<span class="s0">others followed behind, talking and shouting.</span>

<span class="s0">At the corner of the Moroseyka, opposite a large house with closed</span>
<span class="s0">shutters and bearing a bootmaker's signboard, stood a score of thin,</span>
<span class="s0">worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long</span>
<span class="s0">tattered coats.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He should pay folks off properly,&quot; a thin workingman, with frowning</span>
<span class="s0">brows and a straggly beard, was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But he's sucked our blood and now he thinks he's quit of us. He's</span>
<span class="s0">been misleading us all the week and now that he's brought us to this</span>
<span class="s0">pass he's made off.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased</span>
<span class="s0">speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the</span>
<span class="s0">moving crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where are all the folks going?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, to the police, of course!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say, is it true that we have been beaten?&quot; &quot;And what did you</span>
<span class="s0">think? Look what folks are saying.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage</span>
<span class="s0">of the increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.</span>

<span class="s0">The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his</span>
<span class="s0">bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention</span>
<span class="s0">to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded,</span>
<span class="s0">expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their</span>
<span class="s0">minds.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He must keep order, keep the law, that's what the government is</span>
<span class="s0">there for. Am I not right, good Christians?&quot; said the tall youth, with</span>
<span class="s0">a scarcely perceptible smile. &quot;He thinks there's no government! How</span>
<span class="s0">can one do without government? Or else there would be plenty who'd rob</span>
<span class="s0">us.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why talk nonsense?&quot; rejoined voices in the crowd. &quot;Will they give</span>
<span class="s0">up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed</span>
<span class="s0">it! Aren't there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed!</span>
<span class="s0">That's what the government is for. You'd better listen to what</span>
<span class="s0">people are saying,&quot; said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.</span>

<span class="s0">By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered</span>
<span class="s0">round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;An ukase, they are reading an ukase! Reading an ukase!&quot; cried</span>
<span class="s0">voices in the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.</span>

<span class="s0">The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31</span>
<span class="s0">When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the</span>
<span class="s0">demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a</span>
<span class="s0">rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,&quot; he read</span>
<span class="s0">(&quot;Sirin Highness,&quot; said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his</span>
<span class="s0">lips and a frown on his brow), &quot;to consult with him to act, and to aid</span>
<span class="s0">the army to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">the reader went on, and then paused (&quot;Do you see,&quot; shouted the youth</span>
<span class="s0">victoriously, &quot;he's going to clear up the whole affair for</span>
<span class="s0">you....&quot;), &quot;in destroying them, and will send these visitors to the</span>
<span class="s0">devil. I will come back to dinner, and we'll set to work. We will</span>
<span class="s0">do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The</span>
<span class="s0">tall lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had</span>
<span class="s0">understood the last part. In particular, the words &quot;I will come back</span>
<span class="s0">to dinner,&quot; evidently displeased both reader and audience. The</span>
<span class="s0">people's minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple</span>
<span class="s0">and needlessly comprehensible--it was what any one of them might</span>
<span class="s0">have said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest</span>
<span class="s0">authority should not say.</span>

<span class="s0">They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his</span>
<span class="s0">lips and swayed from side to side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We should ask him... that's he himself?&quot;... &quot;Yes, ask him</span>
<span class="s0">indeed!... Why not? He'll explain&quot;... voices in the rear of the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd were suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned</span>
<span class="s0">to the police superintendent's trap which drove into the square</span>
<span class="s0">attended by two mounted dragoons.</span>

<span class="s0">The superintendent of police, who had that morning by Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin's orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that</span>
<span class="s0">matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his</span>
<span class="s0">pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to</span>
<span class="s0">stop.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What people are these?&quot; he shouted to the men, who were moving</span>
<span class="s0">singly and timidly in the direction of his trap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What people are these?&quot; he shouted again, receiving no answer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your honor...&quot; replied the shopman in the frieze coat, &quot;your honor,</span>
<span class="s0">in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count,</span>
<span class="s0">they desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any</span>
<span class="s0">kind of riot, but as his highest excellence said...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued</span>
<span class="s0">concerning you,&quot; said the superintendent of police. &quot;Go on!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">ordered his coachman.</span>

<span class="s0">The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the</span>
<span class="s0">superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.</span>

<span class="s0">The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a</span>
<span class="s0">scared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses</span>
<span class="s0">increased their speed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!&quot; shouted the tall</span>
<span class="s0">youth. &quot;Don't let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.</span>

<span class="s0">Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd went in the direction of the Lubyanka Street.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to</span>
<span class="s0">perish. Do they think we're dogs?&quot; voices in the crowd were heard</span>
<span class="s0">saying more and more frequently.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIV</span>


<span class="s0">On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov, Count Rostopchin had returned to Moscow mortified and</span>
<span class="s0">offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war,</span>
<span class="s0">and because Kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in</span>
<span class="s0">the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed</span>
<span class="s0">to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital</span>
<span class="s0">and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite</span>
<span class="s0">irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and</span>
<span class="s0">surprised by all this, Rostopchin had returned to Moscow. After supper</span>
<span class="s0">he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon</span>
<span class="s0">after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutuzov. This</span>
<span class="s0">letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops</span>
<span class="s0">through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchin. He had known that Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day</span>
<span class="s0">with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but ever since the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle</span>
<span class="s0">had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle,</span>
<span class="s0">and since then the government property had been removed every night,</span>
<span class="s0">and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchin's own</span>
<span class="s0">permission. Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated</span>
<span class="s0">the count, coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order</span>
<span class="s0">from Kutuzov, and received at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.</span>

<span class="s0">When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his</span>
<span class="s0">actions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated</span>
<span class="s0">by two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">and expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this</span>
<span class="s0">twofold aim all Rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable. &quot;Why</span>
<span class="s0">were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of</span>
<span class="s0">corn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into</span>
<span class="s0">believing that Moscow would not be given up--and thereby ruined?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;To presence the tranquillity of the city,&quot; explains Count Rostopchin.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices, and</span>
<span class="s0">Leppich's balloon and other articles removed?&quot; &quot;To leave the town</span>
<span class="s0">empty,&quot; explains Count Rostopchin. One need only admit that public</span>
<span class="s0">tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification.</span>

<span class="s0">All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude</span>
<span class="s0">for public tranquillity.</span>

<span class="s0">On what, then, was Count Rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any</span>
<span class="s0">probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving</span>
<span class="s0">it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause</span>
<span class="s0">the masses to riot?</span>

<span class="s0">Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling</span>
<span class="s0">an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than</span>
<span class="s0">ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of</span>
<span class="s0">September, and except for a mob in the governor's courtyard, assembled</span>
<span class="s0">there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would</span>
<span class="s0">have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if</span>
<span class="s0">after the battle of Borodino, when the surrender of Moscow became</span>
<span class="s0">certain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting the</span>
<span class="s0">people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to</span>
<span class="s0">remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and</span>
<span class="s0">had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and</span>
<span class="s0">impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative</span>
<span class="s0">circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed</span>
<span class="s0">himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy's entry into Smolensk he</span>
<span class="s0">had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of &quot;the heart of Russia.&quot; Not only did it seem to him (as to</span>
<span class="s0">all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow's inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental</span>
<span class="s0">attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a</span>
<span class="s0">coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not</span>
<span class="s0">understand from those in authority. Rostopchin was so pleased with the</span>
<span class="s0">fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it,</span>
<span class="s0">that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt</span>
<span class="s0">the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did</span>
<span class="s0">not know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the</span>
<span class="s0">last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and</span>
<span class="s0">did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If</span>
<span class="s0">the government offices were removed, this was only done on the</span>
<span class="s0">demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was</span>
<span class="s0">absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the</span>
<span class="s0">case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had</span>
<span class="s0">long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his</span>
<span class="s0">intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt</span>
<span class="s0">himself mentally to this new position of affairs.</span>

<span class="s0">All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful</span>
<span class="s0">and had any effect on the people is another question) had been</span>
<span class="s0">simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">patriotic hatred of the French.</span>

<span class="s0">But when events assumed their true historical character, when</span>
<span class="s0">expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it</span>
<span class="s0">was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle,</span>
<span class="s0">when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question</span>
<span class="s0">before Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one</span>
<span class="s0">man, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action</span>
<span class="s0">all the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself</span>
<span class="s0">ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.</span>

<span class="s0">When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory</span>
<span class="s0">note from Kutuzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself</span>
<span class="s0">to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state</span>
<span class="s0">property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it</span>
<span class="s0">was no longer possible to take the whole of it away.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">ruminated. &quot;Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!</span>
<span class="s0">Traitors!&quot; he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and</span>
<span class="s0">traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever</span>
<span class="s0">they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous</span>
<span class="s0">position in which he found himself.</span>

<span class="s0">All that night Count Rostopchin issued orders, for which people came</span>
<span class="s0">to him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the</span>
<span class="s0">count so morose and irritable.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar's Department has</span>
<span class="s0">sent for instructions... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from</span>
<span class="s0">the University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...</span>
<span class="s0">asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire</span>
<span class="s0">Brigade? From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of</span>
<span class="s0">the lunatic asylum...&quot; All night long such announcements were</span>
<span class="s0">continually being received by the count.</span>

<span class="s0">To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating</span>
<span class="s0">that orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair,</span>
<span class="s0">carefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that</span>
<span class="s0">that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that</span>
<span class="s0">might happen.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, tell that blockhead,&quot; he said in reply to the question from the</span>
<span class="s0">Registrar's Department, &quot;that he should remain to guard his documents.</span>
<span class="s0">Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They</span>
<span class="s0">have horses, let them be off to Vladimir, and not leave them to the</span>
<span class="s0">French.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:</span>
<span class="s0">what are your commands?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My commands? Let them go away, that's all.... And let the</span>
<span class="s0">lunatics out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God</span>
<span class="s0">evidently means these other madmen to be free.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you expect me to give you two battalions--which we have not got-</span>
<span class="s0">for a convoy? Release them, that's all about it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkov,</span>
<span class="s0">Vereshchagin...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vereshchagin! Hasn't he been hanged yet?&quot; shouted Rostopchin.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Bring him to me!&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXV</span>


<span class="s0">Toward nine o'clock in the morning, when the troops were already</span>
<span class="s0">moving through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for</span>
<span class="s0">instructions. Those who were able to get away were going of their</span>
<span class="s0">own accord, those who remained behind decided for themselves what they</span>
<span class="s0">must do.</span>

<span class="s0">The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki, and</span>
<span class="s0">sat in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.</span>

<span class="s0">In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that</span>
<span class="s0">it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule</span>
<span class="s0">is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable</span>
<span class="s0">every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts.</span>
<span class="s0">While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his</span>
<span class="s0">frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people</span>
<span class="s0">and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the</span>
<span class="s0">ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea</span>
<span class="s0">begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer</span>
<span class="s0">possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion,</span>
<span class="s0">the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the</span>
<span class="s0">administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power,</span>
<span class="s0">becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostopchin felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.</span>

<span class="s0">The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to</span>
<span class="s0">see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that</span>
<span class="s0">the horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent</span>
<span class="s0">of police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he</span>
<span class="s0">had received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected</span>
<span class="s0">in the courtyard and wished to see him.</span>

<span class="s0">Without saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his</span>
<span class="s0">light, luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold</span>
<span class="s0">of the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he</span>
<span class="s0">had a better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in</span>
<span class="s0">front, flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The</span>
<span class="s0">blood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of</span>
<span class="s0">voices was audible through the closed window.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is my carriage ready?&quot; asked Rostopchin, stepping back from the</span>
<span class="s0">window.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is, your excellency,&quot; replied the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostopchin went again to the balcony door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what do they want?&quot; he asked the superintendent of police.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your</span>
<span class="s0">orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about</span>
<span class="s0">treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency--I hardly</span>
<span class="s0">managed to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You may go. I don't need you to tell me what to do!&quot; exclaimed</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin angrily.</span>

<span class="s0">He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have</span>
<span class="s0">done with me!&quot; thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled</span>
<span class="s0">up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might</span>
<span class="s0">be attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was</span>
<span class="s0">mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Here is that mob, the dregs of the people,&quot; he thought as he gazed at</span>
<span class="s0">the crowd: &quot;this rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a</span>
<span class="s0">victim,&quot; he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his</span>
<span class="s0">arm. And this thought occurred to him just because he himself</span>
<span class="s0">desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is the carriage ready?&quot; he asked again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchagin? He</span>
<span class="s0">is waiting at the porch,&quot; said the adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed Rostopchin, as if struck by an unexpected</span>
<span class="s0">recollection.</span>

<span class="s0">And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the</span>
<span class="s0">balcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed,</span>
<span class="s0">and all eyes were raised to the count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good morning, lads!&quot; said the count briskly and loudly. &quot;Thank</span>
<span class="s0">you for coming. I'll come out to you in a moment, but we must first</span>
<span class="s0">settle with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the</span>
<span class="s0">ruin of Moscow. Wait for me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed</span>
<span class="s0">the door behind him.</span>

<span class="s0">A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;He'll settle with all the villains, you'll see! And you said the</span>
<span class="s0">French... He'll show you what law is!&quot; the mob were saying as if</span>
<span class="s0">reproving one another for their lack of confidence.</span>

<span class="s0">A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,</span>
<span class="s0">gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved</span>
<span class="s0">eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchin, coming out</span>
<span class="s0">there with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking</span>
<span class="s0">someone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is he?&quot; he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man</span>
<span class="s0">coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a</span>
<span class="s0">long thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again</span>
<span class="s0">covered by short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue</span>
<span class="s0">cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty</span>
<span class="s0">hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty,</span>
<span class="s0">trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which</span>
<span class="s0">hampered his irresolute movements.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the</span>
<span class="s0">young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the</span>
<span class="s0">porch. &quot;Put him there.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the</span>
<span class="s0">spot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which</span>
<span class="s0">chafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed,</span>
<span class="s0">and submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.</span>

<span class="s0">For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on</span>
<span class="s0">the step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the</span>
<span class="s0">people, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs,</span>
<span class="s0">groans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.</span>

<span class="s0">While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lads!&quot; said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. &quot;This man,</span>
<span class="s0">Vereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a</span>
<span class="s0">submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated</span>
<span class="s0">young face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down</span>
<span class="s0">hopelessly. At the count's first words he raised it slowly and</span>
<span class="s0">looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet</span>
<span class="s0">his eye. But Rostopchin did not look at him. A vein in the young man's</span>
<span class="s0">long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly his face flushed.</span>

<span class="s0">All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered</span>
<span class="s0">more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled</span>
<span class="s0">sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he had gone over to</span>
<span class="s0">Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">name, he has caused Moscow to perish,&quot; said Rostopchin in a sharp,</span>
<span class="s0">even voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who continued</span>
<span class="s0">to stand in the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight,</span>
<span class="s0">he raised his arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to</span>
<span class="s0">one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling</span>
<span class="s0">atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,</span>
<span class="s0">uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those</span>
<span class="s0">standing in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place</span>
<span class="s0">before them, all stood with wide open eyes and mouths, straining</span>
<span class="s0">with all their strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing</span>
<span class="s0">behind them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">name!&quot; shouted Rostopchin. &quot;Cut him down. I command it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin's</span>
<span class="s0">voice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Count!&quot; exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchagin in</span>
<span class="s0">the midst of the momentary silence that ensued, &quot;Count! One God is</span>
<span class="s0">above us both....&quot; He lifted his head and again the thick vein in</span>
<span class="s0">his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in</span>
<span class="s0">his face.</span>

<span class="s0">He did not finish what he wished to say.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Cut him down! I command it...&quot; shouted Rostopchin, suddenly growing</span>
<span class="s0">pale like Vereshchagin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Draw sabers!&quot; cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.</span>

<span class="s0">Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching</span>
<span class="s0">the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The</span>
<span class="s0">tall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm,</span>
<span class="s0">stood beside Vereshchagin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Saber him!&quot; the dragoon officer almost whispered.</span>

<span class="s0">And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,</span>
<span class="s0">struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking round with a</span>
<span class="s0">frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him.</span>
<span class="s0">A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. &quot;O Lord!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">exclaimed a sorrowful voice.</span>

<span class="s0">But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from</span>
<span class="s0">Vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was</span>
<span class="s0">fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that</span>
<span class="s0">had held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and</span>
<span class="s0">must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by</span>
<span class="s0">the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last</span>
<span class="s0">wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from</span>
<span class="s0">the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and</span>
<span class="s0">engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow.</span>
<span class="s0">Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands,</span>
<span class="s0">rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled,</span>
<span class="s0">seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him</span>
<span class="s0">under the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth. And</span>
<span class="s0">the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who</span>
<span class="s0">tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd.</span>
<span class="s0">It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding</span>
<span class="s0">youth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, despite the</span>
<span class="s0">feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had</span>
<span class="s0">been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and tearing at</span>
<span class="s0">Vereshchagin were unable to kill him, for the crowd pressed from all</span>
<span class="s0">sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it</span>
<span class="s0">impossible for them either to kill him or let him go.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold</span>
<span class="s0">Christ.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture</span>
<span class="s0">serves a thief right. Use the hatchet!... What--still alive?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a</span>
<span class="s0">long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his</span>
<span class="s0">prostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one</span>
<span class="s0">came up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and</span>
<span class="s0">astonishment pushed back again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">voices in the crowd could be heard saying. &quot;Quite a young fellow</span>
<span class="s0">too... must have been a merchant's son. What men!... and they say he's</span>
<span class="s0">not the right one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there's</span>
<span class="s0">another has been beaten too--they say he's nearly done for.... Oh, the</span>
<span class="s0">people... Aren't they afraid of sinning?...&quot; said the same mob now,</span>
<span class="s0">looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long, thin,</span>
<span class="s0">half-severed neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust.</span>

<span class="s0">A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse</span>
<span class="s0">in his excellency's courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it</span>
<span class="s0">away. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it</span>
<span class="s0">along the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its</span>
<span class="s0">long neck trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back</span>
<span class="s0">from it.</span>

<span class="s0">At the moment when Vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with</span>
<span class="s0">savage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchin suddenly turned pale</span>
<span class="s0">and, instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage</span>
<span class="s0">awaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing</span>
<span class="s0">where and why, along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground</span>
<span class="s0">floor. The count's face was white and he could not control the</span>
<span class="s0">feverish twitching of his lower jaw.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,</span>
<span class="s0">please...&quot; said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went</span>
<span class="s0">in the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his caleche.</span>
<span class="s0">The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He</span>
<span class="s0">hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his</span>
<span class="s0">country house in Sokolniki.</span>

<span class="s0">When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer hear the</span>
<span class="s0">shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his</span>
<span class="s0">subordinates. &quot;The mob is terrible--disgusting,&quot; he said to himself in</span>
<span class="s0">French. &quot;They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Count! One God is above us both!&quot;--Vereshchagin's words suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this</span>
<span class="s0">was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled</span>
<span class="s0">disdainfully at himself. &quot;I had other duties,&quot; thought he. &quot;The people</span>
<span class="s0">had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing</span>
<span class="s0">for the public good&quot;--and he began thinking of his social duties to</span>
<span class="s0">his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself--not</span>
<span class="s0">himself as Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore</span>
<span class="s0">Vasilyevich Rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good)</span>
<span class="s0">but himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the</span>
<span class="s0">Tsar. &quot;Had I been simply Theodore Vasilyevich my course of action</span>
<span class="s0">would have been quite different, but it was my duty to safeguard my</span>
<span class="s0">life and dignity as commander in chief.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no</span>
<span class="s0">longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin grew</span>
<span class="s0">physically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became</span>
<span class="s0">physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally</span>
<span class="s0">tranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopchin was not a new</span>
<span class="s0">one. Since the world began and men have killed one another no one</span>
<span class="s0">has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without</span>
<span class="s0">comforting himself with this same idea. This idea is le bien public,</span>
<span class="s0">the hypothetical welfare of other people.</span>

<span class="s0">To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he</span>
<span class="s0">who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies.</span>
<span class="s0">And Rostopchin now knew it.</span>

<span class="s0">Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but</span>
<span class="s0">he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully</span>
<span class="s0">contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a</span>
<span class="s0">criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death,&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchagin to</span>
<span class="s0">hard labor), &quot;he was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go</span>
<span class="s0">unpunished and so I have killed two birds with one stone: to appease</span>
<span class="s0">the mob I gave them a victim and at the same time punished a</span>
<span class="s0">miscreant.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about</span>
<span class="s0">domestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.</span>

<span class="s0">Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the</span>
<span class="s0">Sokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but</span>
<span class="s0">considering what was to come. He was driving to the Yauza bridge where</span>
<span class="s0">he had heard that Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchin was mentally preparing</span>
<span class="s0">the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutuzov for</span>
<span class="s0">his deception. He would make that foxy old courtier feel that the</span>
<span class="s0">responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the</span>
<span class="s0">abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded</span>
<span class="s0">it) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he</span>
<span class="s0">would say to Kutuzov, Rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and</span>
<span class="s0">gazed sternly from side to side.</span>

<span class="s0">The Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of</span>
<span class="s0">the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in</span>
<span class="s0">white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting</span>
<span class="s0">and gesticulating.</span>

<span class="s0">One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin's</span>
<span class="s0">carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons looked</span>
<span class="s0">with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and</span>
<span class="s0">especially at the one running toward them.</span>

<span class="s0">Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering</span>
<span class="s0">dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to</span>
<span class="s0">him to stop. The lunatic's solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow,</span>
<span class="s0">with its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with</span>
<span class="s0">saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Stop! Pull up, I tell you!&quot; he cried in a piercing voice, and again</span>
<span class="s0">shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.</span>

<span class="s0">Coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead.</span>
<span class="s0">They stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall</span>
<span class="s0">rise. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown...</span>
<span class="s0">Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!&quot; he cried,</span>
<span class="s0">raising his voice higher and higher.</span>

<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd</span>
<span class="s0">closed in on Vereshchagin. He turned away. &quot;Go fas... faster!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">cried in a trembling voice to his coachman. The caleche flew over</span>
<span class="s0">the ground as fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time</span>
<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing</span>
<span class="s0">fainter in the distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the</span>
<span class="s0">astonished, frightened, bloodstained face of &quot;the traitor&quot; in the</span>
<span class="s0">fur-lined coat.</span>

<span class="s0">Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchin already felt that it</span>
<span class="s0">had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt</span>
<span class="s0">clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with</span>
<span class="s0">time, but that the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in</span>
<span class="s0">his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He</span>
<span class="s0">seemed still to hear the sound of his own words: &quot;Cut him down! I</span>
<span class="s0">command it....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said</span>
<span class="s0">them.... I need not have said them,&quot; he thought. &quot;And then nothing</span>
<span class="s0">would have happened.&quot; He saw the frightened and then infuriated face</span>
<span class="s0">of the dragoon who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid</span>
<span class="s0">reproach that boy in the fur-lined coat had turned upon him. &quot;But I</span>
<span class="s0">did not do it for my own sake. I was bound to act that way.... The</span>
<span class="s0">mob, the traitor... the public welfare,&quot; thought he.</span>

<span class="s0">Troops were still crowding at the Yauza bridge. It was hot. Kutuzov,</span>
<span class="s0">dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his</span>
<span class="s0">whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily. A man in a</span>
<span class="s0">general's uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said</span>
<span class="s0">something in French. It was Count Rostopchin. He told Kutuzov that</span>
<span class="s0">he had come because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army</span>
<span class="s0">remained.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not</span>
<span class="s0">told me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle;</span>
<span class="s0">all this would not have happened,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov looked at Rostopchin as if, not grasping what was said to</span>
<span class="s0">him, he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment</span>
<span class="s0">on the face of the man addressing him. Rostopchin grew confused and</span>
<span class="s0">became silent. Kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his</span>
<span class="s0">penetrating gaze from Rostopchin's face muttered softly:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Whether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he</span>
<span class="s0">spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be</span>
<span class="s0">meaningless, at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and hastily left</span>
<span class="s0">him. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin, took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he</span>
<span class="s0">began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVI</span>


<span class="s0">Toward four o'clock in the afternoon Murat's troops were entering</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. In front rode a detachment of Wurttemberg hussars and behind</span>
<span class="s0">them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.</span>

<span class="s0">About the middle of the Arbat Street, near the Church of the</span>
<span class="s0">Miraculous Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the</span>
<span class="s0">advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the</span>
<span class="s0">citadel, le Kremlin.</span>

<span class="s0">Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow.</span>
<span class="s0">They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired</span>
<span class="s0">commander dressed up in feathers and gold.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is that their Tsar himself? He's not bad!&quot; low voices could be</span>
<span class="s0">heard saying.</span>

<span class="s0">An interpreter rode up to the group.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Take off your cap... your caps!&quot; These words went from one to</span>
<span class="s0">another in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and</span>
<span class="s0">asked if it was far to the Kremlin. The porter, listening in</span>
<span class="s0">perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that</span>
<span class="s0">the interpreter was speaking Russian, did not understand what was</span>
<span class="s0">being said to him and slipped behind the others.</span>

<span class="s0">Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and</span>
<span class="s0">several voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French</span>
<span class="s0">officer, returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat</span>
<span class="s0">and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and</span>
<span class="s0">that there was probably an ambuscade there.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good!&quot; said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his</span>
<span class="s0">suite, ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the</span>
<span class="s0">gates.</span>

<span class="s0">The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and</span>
<span class="s0">advanced up the Arbat. When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka</span>
<span class="s0">Street they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers</span>
<span class="s0">superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin</span>
<span class="s0">through field glasses.</span>

<span class="s0">The bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound</span>
<span class="s0">troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few</span>
<span class="s0">infantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had</span>
<span class="s0">been put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as</span>
<span class="s0">soon as an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was</span>
<span class="s0">standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and</span>
<span class="s0">the latter ran back again with his men.</span>

<span class="s0">The sound of three more shots came from the gate.</span>

<span class="s0">One shot struck a French soldier's foot, and from behind the screens</span>
<span class="s0">came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a</span>
<span class="s0">word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of</span>
<span class="s0">the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined</span>
<span class="s0">concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from</span>
<span class="s0">the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvizhenka,</span>
<span class="s0">Mokhavaya, or Kutafyev Street, nor the Troitsa Gate (places familiar</span>
<span class="s0">in Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove</span>
<span class="s0">sanguinary. And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the</span>
<span class="s0">gates ceased. The guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash</span>
<span class="s0">off their linstocks, and an officer gave the word &quot;Fire!&quot; This was</span>
<span class="s0">followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot, one after</span>
<span class="s0">another. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the</span>
<span class="s0">wooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over</span>
<span class="s0">the Square.</span>

<span class="s0">A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the</span>
<span class="s0">stone-built Kremlin had died away the French heard a strange sound</span>
<span class="s0">above their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and</span>
<span class="s0">circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings.</span>
<span class="s0">Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway</span>
<span class="s0">and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a</span>
<span class="s0">peasant's coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Fire!&quot; repeated the officer once more, and the reports of a musket</span>
<span class="s0">and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The gate again</span>
<span class="s0">hidden by smoke.</span>

<span class="s0">Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three</span>
<span class="s0">wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot</span>
<span class="s0">of the wall, toward the Znamenka.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Clear that away!&quot; said the officer, pointing to the beams and the</span>
<span class="s0">corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw</span>
<span class="s0">the corpses over the parapet.</span>

<span class="s0">Who these men were nobody knew. &quot;Clear that away!&quot; was all that</span>
<span class="s0">was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed</span>
<span class="s0">later on that they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few</span>
<span class="s0">eloquent lines to their memory: &quot;These wretches had occupied the</span>
<span class="s0">sacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal,</span>
<span class="s0">and fired&quot; (the wretches) &quot;at the French. Some of them were sabered</span>
<span class="s0">and the Kremlin was purged of their presence.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered</span>
<span class="s0">the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of</span>
<span class="s0">the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the</span>
<span class="s0">Square for fuel and kindled fires there.</span>

<span class="s0">Other detachments passed through the Kremlin and encamped along</span>
<span class="s0">the Moroseyka, the Lubyanka, and Pokrovka Streets. Others quartered</span>
<span class="s0">themselves along the Vozdvizhenka, the Nikolski, and the Tverskoy</span>
<span class="s0">Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French</span>
<span class="s0">were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in</span>
<span class="s0">it as in a camp.</span>

<span class="s0">Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their</span>
<span class="s0">original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order.</span>
<span class="s0">It was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army.</span>
<span class="s0">But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into</span>
<span class="s0">their different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various</span>
<span class="s0">regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the</span>
<span class="s0">army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript,</span>
<span class="s0">neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When</span>
<span class="s0">five weeks later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed</span>
<span class="s0">an army. They were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of</span>
<span class="s0">articles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man</span>
<span class="s0">when he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but</span>
<span class="s0">merely to keep what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its</span>
<span class="s0">paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts</span>
<span class="s0">will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">perishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish</span>
<span class="s0">because they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they</span>
<span class="s0">had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to</span>
<span class="s0">open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment</span>
<span class="s0">had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left.</span>
<span class="s0">Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the</span>
<span class="s0">windows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and</span>
<span class="s0">storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the</span>
<span class="s0">yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors,</span>
<span class="s0">lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with</span>
<span class="s0">rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or</span>
<span class="s0">caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the</span>
<span class="s0">shops and houses--but there was no army.</span>

<span class="s0">Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day</span>
<span class="s0">forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding</span>
<span class="s0">any violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a</span>
<span class="s0">roll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures the</span>
<span class="s0">men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the</span>
<span class="s0">wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As</span>
<span class="s0">a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren</span>
<span class="s0">field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as</span>
<span class="s0">soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over</span>
<span class="s0">the wealthy city.</span>

<span class="s0">No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers--like water</span>
<span class="s0">percolating through sand--spread irresistibly through the city in</span>
<span class="s0">all directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched. The</span>
<span class="s0">cavalry, on entering a merchant's house that had been abandoned and</span>
<span class="s0">finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,</span>
<span class="s0">all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of</span>
<span class="s0">them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and</span>
<span class="s0">quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they</span>
<span class="s0">had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the</span>
<span class="s0">streets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been</span>
<span class="s0">abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the</span>
<span class="s0">taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had</span>
<span class="s0">been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select</span>
<span class="s0">caleches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had</span>
<span class="s0">remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby</span>
<span class="s0">to secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth</span>
<span class="s0">and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the</span>
<span class="s0">French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where,</span>
<span class="s0">they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed</span>
<span class="s0">the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground</span>
<span class="s0">both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in</span>
<span class="s0">the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted</span>
<span class="s0">city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the</span>
<span class="s0">army and the wealthy city.</span>


<span class="s0">The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce de</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchine,* the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,</span>
<span class="s0">however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning</span>
<span class="s0">of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people,</span>
<span class="s0">responsible for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a</span>
<span class="s0">position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite</span>
<span class="s0">apart from whether it had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior</span>
<span class="s0">fire engines. Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of</span>
<span class="s0">shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several</span>
<span class="s0">days. A town built of wood, where scarcely a day passes without</span>
<span class="s0">conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police</span>
<span class="s0">force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left</span>
<span class="s0">it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of</span>
<span class="s0">the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals</span>
<span class="s0">twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the</span>
<span class="s0">villages of any district and the number of fires in that district</span>
<span class="s0">immediately increases. How much then must the probability of fire be</span>
<span class="s0">increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are</span>
<span class="s0">quartered. &quot;Le patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine&quot; and the barbarity of</span>
<span class="s0">the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire</span>
<span class="s0">by the soldiers' pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the</span>
<span class="s0">carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even</span>
<span class="s0">if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any</span>
<span class="s0">reason to burn the houses--in any case a troublesome and dangerous</span>
<span class="s0">thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same</span>
<span class="s0">thing would have happened without any incendiarism.</span>


<span class="s0">*To Rostopchin's ferocious patriotism.</span>


<span class="s0">However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchin's</span>
<span class="s0">ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later</span>
<span class="s0">on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is</span>
<span class="s0">impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of</span>
<span class="s0">the fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house</span>
<span class="s0">must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are</span>
<span class="s0">allowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not</span>
<span class="s0">by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not</span>
<span class="s0">remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and</span>
<span class="s0">salt, nor bring them the keys of the city.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVII</span>


<span class="s0">The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it</span>
<span class="s0">did, only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the</span>
<span class="s0">evening of the second of September.</span>

<span class="s0">After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely</span>
<span class="s0">obsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this</span>
<span class="s0">thought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of</span>
<span class="s0">the past, understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and</span>
<span class="s0">heard appeared to him like a dream.</span>

<span class="s0">He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life's</span>
<span class="s0">demands that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was</span>
<span class="s0">unable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexeevich's house, on the</span>
<span class="s0">plea of sorting the deceased's books and papers, only in search of</span>
<span class="s0">rest from life's turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph</span>
<span class="s0">Alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts, quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he</span>
<span class="s0">felt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph</span>
<span class="s0">Alexeevich's study he really found it. When he sat with his elbows</span>
<span class="s0">on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study,</span>
<span class="s0">calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after</span>
<span class="s0">another in his imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodino and</span>
<span class="s0">of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared</span>
<span class="s0">with the truth, simplicity, and strength of the class of men he</span>
<span class="s0">mentally classed as they. When Gerasim roused him from his reverie the</span>
<span class="s0">idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">which he knew was projected. And with that object he had asked Gerasim</span>
<span class="s0">to get him a peasant's coat and a pistol, confiding to him his</span>
<span class="s0">intentions of remaining in Joseph Alexeevich's house and keeping his</span>
<span class="s0">name secret. Then during the first day spent in inaction and</span>
<span class="s0">solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic</span>
<span class="s0">manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously</span>
<span class="s0">occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in</span>
<span class="s0">connection with Bonaparte's more than once vaguely presented itself.</span>
<span class="s0">But the idea that he, L'russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit</span>
<span class="s0">to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that</span>
<span class="s0">often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.</span>

<span class="s0">When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part</span>
<span class="s0">among the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs and Natasha had said to him: &quot;Are you remaining in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow?... How splendid!&quot; the thought flashed into his mind that it</span>
<span class="s0">really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to</span>
<span class="s0">remain there and do what he was predestined to do.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not</span>
<span class="s0">lagging in any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate.</span>
<span class="s0">But when he returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be</span>
<span class="s0">defended, he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a</span>
<span class="s0">possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He</span>
<span class="s0">must remain in Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and</span>
<span class="s0">kill him, and either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe-</span>
<span class="s0">which it seemed to him was solely due to Napoleon.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte's life in</span>
<span class="s0">1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been</span>
<span class="s0">shot. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out</span>
<span class="s0">his design excited him still more.</span>

<span class="s0">Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this</span>
<span class="s0">purpose. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and</span>
<span class="s0">suffering in view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had</span>
<span class="s0">caused him to go to Mozhaysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way</span>
<span class="s0">to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away</span>
<span class="s0">from his home and, in place of the luxury and comfort to which he</span>
<span class="s0">was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the</span>
<span class="s0">same food as Gerasim. The other was that vague and quite Russian</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial, and</span>
<span class="s0">human--for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest</span>
<span class="s0">good in the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange and</span>
<span class="s0">fascinating feeling at the Sloboda Palace, when he had suddenly felt</span>
<span class="s0">that wealth, power, and life--all that men so painstakingly acquire</span>
<span class="s0">and guard--if it has any worth has so only by reason the joy with</span>
<span class="s0">which it can all be renounced.</span>

<span class="s0">It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his</span>
<span class="s0">last penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for</span>
<span class="s0">no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money</span>
<span class="s0">he possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions</span>
<span class="s0">which from an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it</span>
<span class="s0">were, his personal power and strength, affirming the existence of a</span>
<span class="s0">higher, nonhuman criterion of life.</span>

<span class="s0">From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the</span>
<span class="s0">first time at the Sloboda Palace he had been continuously under its</span>
<span class="s0">influence, but only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at</span>
<span class="s0">this moment Pierre was supported in his design and prevented from</span>
<span class="s0">renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction. If he</span>
<span class="s0">were now to leave Moscow like everyone else, his flight from home, the</span>
<span class="s0">peasant coat, the pistol, and his announcement to the Rostovs that</span>
<span class="s0">he would remain in Moscow would all become not merely meaningless</span>
<span class="s0">but contemptible and ridiculous, and to this Pierre was very</span>
<span class="s0">sensitive.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded</span>
<span class="s0">to his mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he</span>
<span class="s0">drank during those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty</span>
<span class="s0">unchanged linen, two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa</span>
<span class="s0">without bedding--all this kept him in a state of excitement</span>
<span class="s0">bordering on insanity.</span>

<span class="s0">It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The French had already</span>
<span class="s0">entered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only</span>
<span class="s0">thought about his undertaking, going over its minutest details in</span>
<span class="s0">his mind. In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either</span>
<span class="s0">the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon, but with</span>
<span class="s0">extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own</span>
<span class="s0">destruction and heroic endurance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">thought. &quot;Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol</span>
<span class="s0">or dagger? But that is all the same! 'It is not I but the hand of</span>
<span class="s0">Providence that punishes thee,' I shall say,&quot; thought he, imagining</span>
<span class="s0">what he would say when killing Napoleon. &quot;Well then, take me and</span>
<span class="s0">execute me!&quot; he went on, speaking to himself and bowing his head</span>
<span class="s0">with a sad but firm expression.</span>

<span class="s0">While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to</span>
<span class="s0">himself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold</span>
<span class="s0">appeared the figure of Makar Alexeevich, always so timid before but</span>
<span class="s0">now quite transformed.</span>

<span class="s0">His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was</span>
<span class="s0">obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but</span>
<span class="s0">noticing embarrassment on Pierre's face immediately grew bold and,</span>
<span class="s0">staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They're frightened,&quot; he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">say I won't surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it</span>
<span class="s0">with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.</span>

<span class="s0">Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexeevich, stopped</span>
<span class="s0">him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">coming out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the</span>
<span class="s0">half-crazy old man. Makar Alexeevich, frowning with exertion, held</span>
<span class="s0">on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic</span>
<span class="s0">fancy in his head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To arms! Board them! No, you shan't get it,&quot; he yelled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness--please, sir,</span>
<span class="s0">to let go! Please, sir...&quot; pleaded Gerasim, trying carefully to</span>
<span class="s0">steer Makar Alexeevich by the elbows back to the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who are you? Bonaparte!...&quot; shouted Makar Alexeevich.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow</span>
<span class="s0">me to have the pistol.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?&quot; shouted Makar</span>
<span class="s0">Alexeevich, brandishing the pistol. &quot;Board them!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Catch hold!&quot; whispered Gerasim to the porter.</span>

<span class="s0">They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the</span>
<span class="s0">door.</span>

<span class="s0">The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle</span>
<span class="s0">and of a tipsy, hoarse voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated</span>
<span class="s0">from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">cried.</span>

<span class="s0">Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go, and in the now</span>
<span class="s0">silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front</span>
<span class="s0">door could be heard.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he</span>
<span class="s0">would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood</span>
<span class="s0">at the half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as</span>
<span class="s0">soon as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">did not retire--an irresistible curiosity kept him there.</span>

<span class="s0">There were two of them. One was an officer--a tall, soldierly,</span>
<span class="s0">handsome man--the other evidently a private or an orderly,</span>
<span class="s0">sunburned, short, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull</span>
<span class="s0">expression. The officer walked in front, leaning on a stick and</span>
<span class="s0">slightly limping. When he had advanced a few steps he stopped,</span>
<span class="s0">having apparently decided that these were good quarters, turned</span>
<span class="s0">round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in a loud voice of</span>
<span class="s0">command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done that, the</span>
<span class="s0">officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his</span>
<span class="s0">mustache and lightly touched his hat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bonjour, la compagnie!&quot;* said he gaily, smiling and looking about</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Good day, everybody!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">No one gave any reply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vous etes le bourgeois?&quot;* the officer asked Gerasim.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Are you the master here?&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quartier, quartier, logement!&quot; said the officer, looking down at</span>
<span class="s0">the little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. &quot;Les</span>
<span class="s0">francais sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fachons</span>
<span class="s0">pas, mon vieux!&quot;* added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerasim</span>
<span class="s0">on the shoulder. &quot;Well, does no one speak French in this</span>
<span class="s0">establishment?&quot; he asked again in French, looking around and meeting</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's eyes. Pierre moved away from the door.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good fellows. What</span>
<span class="s0">the devil! There, don't let us be cross, old fellow!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Again the officer turned to Gerasim and asked him to show him the</span>
<span class="s0">rooms in the house.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Master, not here--don't understand... me, you...&quot; said Gerasim,</span>
<span class="s0">trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.</span>

<span class="s0">Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before</span>
<span class="s0">Gerasim's nose, intimating that he did not understand him either,</span>
<span class="s0">and moved, limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">wished to go away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makar</span>
<span class="s0">Alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his</span>
<span class="s0">hand. With a madman's cunning, Makar Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman,</span>
<span class="s0">raised his pistol, and took aim.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Board them!&quot; yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger.</span>
<span class="s0">Hearing the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre threw himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and</span>
<span class="s0">struck up the pistol Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the</span>
<span class="s0">trigger, there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a</span>
<span class="s0">cloud of smoke. The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.</span>

<span class="s0">Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to</span>
<span class="s0">the officer and addressed him in French.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are not wounded?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think not,&quot; answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. &quot;But</span>
<span class="s0">I have had a lucky escape this time,&quot; he added, pointing to the</span>
<span class="s0">damaged plaster of the wall. &quot;Who is that man?&quot; said he, looking</span>
<span class="s0">sternly at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,&quot; said Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly, quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. &quot;He is</span>
<span class="s0">an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The officer went up to Makar Alexeevich and took him by the collar.</span>

<span class="s0">Makar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about</span>
<span class="s0">to fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Brigand! You shall pay for this,&quot; said the Frenchman, letting go of</span>
<span class="s0">him. &quot;We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon</span>
<span class="s0">traitors,&quot; he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine</span>
<span class="s0">energetic gesture.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold</span>
<span class="s0">that drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence</span>
<span class="s0">with the same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with</span>
<span class="s0">a smile. For a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome</span>
<span class="s0">face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out</span>
<span class="s0">his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have saved my life. You are French,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman</span>
<span class="s0">could perform a great deed, and to save his life--the life of M.</span>
<span class="s0">Ramballe, captain of the 13th Light Regiment--was undoubtedly a very</span>
<span class="s0">great deed.</span>

<span class="s0">But however indubitable that conclusion and the officer's conviction</span>
<span class="s0">based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am Russian,&quot; he said quickly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,&quot; said the officer, waving his</span>
<span class="s0">finger before his nose and smiling. &quot;You shall tell me all about</span>
<span class="s0">that presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what</span>
<span class="s0">are we to do with this man?&quot; he added, addressing himself to Pierre as</span>
<span class="s0">to a brother.</span>

<span class="s0">Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that</span>
<span class="s0">loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the</span>
<span class="s0">officer's look and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again</span>
<span class="s0">explained who Makar Alexeevich was and how just before their arrival</span>
<span class="s0">that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had</span>
<span class="s0">not had time to recover from him, and begged the officer to let the</span>
<span class="s0">deed go unpunished.</span>

<span class="s0">The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with</span>
<span class="s0">his arm.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant</span>
<span class="s0">it you. Lead that man away!&quot; said he quickly and energetically, and</span>
<span class="s0">taking the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for</span>
<span class="s0">saving his life, he went with him into the room.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage</span>
<span class="s0">asking what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish</span>
<span class="s0">the culprits, but the officer sternly checked them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You will be called in when you are wanted,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile</span>
<span class="s0">had time to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">he. &quot;Shall I serve them up?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and some wine,&quot; answered the captain.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXIX</span>


<span class="s0">When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter</span>
<span class="s0">again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and</span>
<span class="s0">wished to go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so</span>
<span class="s0">very polite, amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">for saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat</span>
<span class="s0">down with him in the parlor--the first room they entered. To</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the captain,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering</span>
<span class="s0">an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all</span>
<span class="s0">that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his</span>
<span class="s0">life.</span>

<span class="s0">Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving</span>
<span class="s0">the feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">feelings were, the latter would probably have left him, but the</span>
<span class="s0">man's animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,&quot; said the officer,</span>
<span class="s0">looking at Pierre's fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his</span>
<span class="s0">finger. &quot;I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman</span>
<span class="s0">never forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my</span>
<span class="s0">friendship. That is all I can say.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of</span>
<span class="s0">the word) in the officer's voice, in the expression of his face and in</span>
<span class="s0">his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman's smile, pressed the hand held out to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the</span>
<span class="s0">Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">introduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his</span>
<span class="s0">lips under his mustache. &quot;Will you now be so good as to tell me with</span>
<span class="s0">whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in</span>
<span class="s0">the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,</span>
<span class="s0">began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason</span>
<span class="s0">for concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, please!&quot; said he. &quot;I understand your reasons. You are an</span>
<span class="s0">officer... a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us.</span>
<span class="s0">That's not my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am</span>
<span class="s0">quite at your service. You belong to the gentry?&quot; he concluded with</span>
<span class="s0">a shade of inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. &quot;Your</span>
<span class="s0">baptismal name, if you please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you</span>
<span class="s0">say.... That's all I want to know.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and</span>
<span class="s0">vodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a</span>
<span class="s0">Russian cellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share</span>
<span class="s0">his dinner, and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a</span>
<span class="s0">healthy and hungry man, munching his food rapidly with his strong</span>
<span class="s0">teeth, continually smacking his lips, and repeating--&quot;Excellent!</span>
<span class="s0">Delicious!&quot; His face grew red and was covered with perspiration.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure. Morel, the</span>
<span class="s0">orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of</span>
<span class="s0">claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass, taken from the</span>
<span class="s0">kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to the French</span>
<span class="s0">and had been given a special name. They called it limonade de cochon</span>
<span class="s0">(pig's lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he</span>
<span class="s0">had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had</span>
<span class="s0">taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and</span>
<span class="s0">applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to</span>
<span class="s0">its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the</span>
<span class="s0">captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through</span>
<span class="s0">dinner.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for</span>
<span class="s0">saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my</span>
<span class="s0">body already. Here is one I got at Wagram&quot; (he touched his side)</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;and a second at Smolensk&quot;--he showed a scar on his cheek--&quot;and this</span>
<span class="s0">leg which as you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh</span>
<span class="s0">at the great battle of la Moskowa. Sacre Dieu! It was splendid! That</span>
<span class="s0">deluge of fire was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us</span>
<span class="s0">there, my word! You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of</span>
<span class="s0">the cough I caught there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity</span>
<span class="s0">those who did not see it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was there,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes.</span>
<span class="s0">The great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!&quot; continued the Frenchman.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times--sure as I</span>
<span class="s0">sit here. Three times we reached the guns and three times we were</span>
<span class="s0">thrown back like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre! Your grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close</span>
<span class="s0">up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine</span>
<span class="s0">fellows! Our King of Naples, who knows what's what, cried 'Bravo!' Ha,</span>
<span class="s0">ha! So you are one of us soldiers!&quot; he added, smiling, after a</span>
<span class="s0">momentary pause. &quot;So much the better, so much the better, Monsieur</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre! Terrible in battle... gallant... with the fair&quot; (he winked and</span>
<span class="s0">smiled), &quot;that's what the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren't they?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The captain was so naively and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so</span>
<span class="s0">pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked</span>
<span class="s0">merrily at him. Probably the word &quot;gallant&quot; turned the captain's</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts to the state of Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered</span>
<span class="s0">it?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha, ha, ha!&quot; The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle,</span>
<span class="s0">patting Pierre on the shoulder. &quot;What a thing to say!&quot; he exclaimed.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Paris?... But Paris, Paris...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Paris--the capital of the world,&quot; Pierre finished his remark for</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in</span>
<span class="s0">the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly</span>
<span class="s0">eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, if you hadn't told me you were Russian, I should have wagered</span>
<span class="s0">that you were Parisian! You have that... I don't know what, that...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have been in Paris. I spent years there,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn't know</span>
<span class="s0">Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is</span>
<span class="s0">Talma, la Duchenois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before,</span>
<span class="s0">he added quickly: &quot;There is only one Paris in the world. You have been</span>
<span class="s0">to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I don't esteem you the</span>
<span class="s0">less for it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days</span>
<span class="s0">he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To return to your ladies--I hear they are lovely. What a wretched</span>
<span class="s0">idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army</span>
<span class="s0">is in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants,</span>
<span class="s0">now--that's another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know</span>
<span class="s0">us better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome,</span>
<span class="s0">Warsaw, all the world's capitals.... We are feared, but we are</span>
<span class="s0">loved. We are nice to know. And then the Emperor...&quot; he began, but</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor,&quot; Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and</span>
<span class="s0">embarrassed, &quot;is the Emperor...?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius-</span>
<span class="s0">that's what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I</span>
<span class="s0">assure you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an</span>
<span class="s0">emigrant count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold</span>
<span class="s0">of me. I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with</span>
<span class="s0">which he has covered France. When I understood what he wanted--when</span>
<span class="s0">I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I</span>
<span class="s0">said to myself: 'That is a monarch,' and I devoted myself to him! So</span>
<span class="s0">there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages past or</span>
<span class="s0">future.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is he in Moscow?&quot; Pierre stammered with a guilty look.</span>

<span class="s0">The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, he will make his entry tomorrow,&quot; he replied, and continued his</span>
<span class="s0">talk.</span>

<span class="s0">Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at</span>
<span class="s0">the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Wurttemberg hussars</span>
<span class="s0">had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the</span>
<span class="s0">captain's horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because</span>
<span class="s0">the hussars did not understand what was said to them in French.</span>

<span class="s0">The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern</span>
<span class="s0">voice asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding</span>
<span class="s0">officer, and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that</span>
<span class="s0">were already occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the</span>
<span class="s0">two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his</span>
<span class="s0">commanding officer, but in reply to the third question which he did</span>
<span class="s0">not understand said, introducing broken French into his own German,</span>
<span class="s0">that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had</span>
<span class="s0">ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who</span>
<span class="s0">knew German, translated what the German said to the captain and gave</span>
<span class="s0">the captain's reply to the Wurttemberg hussar in German. When he had</span>
<span class="s0">understood what was said to him, the German submitted and took his men</span>
<span class="s0">elsewhere. The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in</span>
<span class="s0">a loud voice.</span>

<span class="s0">When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as</span>
<span class="s0">before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He</span>
<span class="s0">really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and</span>
<span class="s0">he was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the</span>
<span class="s0">position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that</span>
<span class="s0">the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him.</span>
<span class="s0">Painful as that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the</span>
<span class="s0">moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The</span>
<span class="s0">few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this</span>
<span class="s0">good-natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which</span>
<span class="s0">he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the</span>
<span class="s0">execution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were</span>
<span class="s0">ready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still</span>
<span class="s0">considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the</span>
<span class="s0">evildoer, but now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know</span>
<span class="s0">why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his</span>
<span class="s0">intention. He struggled against the confession of his weakness but</span>
<span class="s0">dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy</span>
<span class="s0">frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice,</span>
<span class="s0">had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met.</span>

<span class="s0">The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a</span>
<span class="s0">tune.</span>

<span class="s0">The Frenchman's chatter which had previously amused Pierre now</span>
<span class="s0">repelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture</span>
<span class="s0">with which he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. &quot;I</span>
<span class="s0">will go away immediately. I won't say another word to him,&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. He thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go</span>
<span class="s0">away, but could not do so.</span>

<span class="s0">The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up</span>
<span class="s0">and down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as</span>
<span class="s0">if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful,&quot; he suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">said. &quot;He's a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he's a</span>
<span class="s0">German.&quot; He sat down facing Pierre. &quot;By the way, you know German,</span>
<span class="s0">then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked at him in silence.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is the German for 'shelter'?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Shelter?&quot; Pierre repeated. &quot;The German for shelter is Unterkunft.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How do you say it?&quot; the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Unterkunft,&quot; Pierre repeated.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Onterkoff,&quot; said the captain and looked at Pierre for some</span>
<span class="s0">seconds with laughing eyes. &quot;These Germans are first-rate fools, don't</span>
<span class="s0">you think so, Monsieur Pierre?&quot; he concluded.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, let's have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall</span>
<span class="s0">we? Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!&quot; he called out</span>
<span class="s0">gaily.</span>

<span class="s0">Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled</span>
<span class="s0">expression on his companion's face. Ramballe, with genuine distress</span>
<span class="s0">and sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There now, we're sad,&quot; said he, touching Pierre's hand. &quot;Have I</span>
<span class="s0">upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?&quot; he asked Pierre.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps it's the state of affairs?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman's</span>
<span class="s0">eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for</span>
<span class="s0">you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and</span>
<span class="s0">death. I say it with my hand on my heart!&quot; said he, striking his</span>
<span class="s0">chest.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned</span>
<span class="s0">that &quot;shelter&quot; was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">brightened.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!&quot; he cried gaily,</span>
<span class="s0">filling two glasses with wine.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied</span>
<span class="s0">his too, again pressed Pierre's hand, and leaned his elbows on the</span>
<span class="s0">table in a pensive attitude.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, my dear friend,&quot; he began, &quot;such is fortune's caprice. Who</span>
<span class="s0">would have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons</span>
<span class="s0">in the service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am</span>
<span class="s0">in Moscow with him. I must tell you, mon cher,&quot; he continued in the</span>
<span class="s0">sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;that our name is one of the most ancient in France.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And with a Frenchman's easy and naive frankness the captain told</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and</span>
<span class="s0">manhood, and all about his relations and his financial and family</span>
<span class="s0">affairs, &quot;ma pauvre mere&quot; playing of course an important part in the</span>
<span class="s0">story.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But all that is only life's setting, the real thing is love-</span>
<span class="s0">love! Am I not right, Monsieur Pierre?&quot; said he, growing animated.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Another glass?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, women, women!&quot; and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.</span>

<span class="s0">There were very many of these, as one could easily believe,</span>
<span class="s0">looking at the officer's handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the</span>
<span class="s0">eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe's</span>
<span class="s0">love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the</span>
<span class="s0">special charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such</span>
<span class="s0">sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the</span>
<span class="s0">charm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">listened to him with curiosity.</span>

<span class="s0">It was plain that l'amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not</span>
<span class="s0">that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor</span>
<span class="s0">was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the</span>
<span class="s0">one he considered the &quot;love of clodhoppers&quot; and the other the &quot;love of</span>
<span class="s0">simpletons.&quot;) L'amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted</span>
<span class="s0">principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a</span>
<span class="s0">combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.</span>

<span class="s0">Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a</span>
<span class="s0">fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a</span>
<span class="s0">charming, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching</span>
<span class="s0">marquise. The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the</span>
<span class="s0">daughter, ending in the mother's sacrificing herself and offering</span>
<span class="s0">her daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the</span>
<span class="s0">captain, though it was the memory of a distant past. Then he recounted</span>
<span class="s0">an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover, and</span>
<span class="s0">he--the lover--assumed the role of the husband, as well as several</span>
<span class="s0">droll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where &quot;shelter&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the</span>
<span class="s0">young girls are &quot;too blonde.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain's</span>
<span class="s0">memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face,</span>
<span class="s0">was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving</span>
<span class="s0">of life continually occurred in the captain's stories) and the Pole</span>
<span class="s0">had entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de coeur) while</span>
<span class="s0">himself entering the French service. The captain was happy, the</span>
<span class="s0">enchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as</span>
<span class="s0">he did so: &quot;I have saved your life, and I save your honor!&quot; Having</span>
<span class="s0">repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a</span>
<span class="s0">shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this</span>
<span class="s0">touching recollection.</span>

<span class="s0">Listening to the captain's tales, Pierre--as often happens late in</span>
<span class="s0">the evening and under the influence of wine--followed all that was</span>
<span class="s0">told him, understood it all, and at the same time followed a train</span>
<span class="s0">of personal memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his</span>
<span class="s0">mind. While listening to these love stories his own love for Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that</span>
<span class="s0">love in his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe's</span>
<span class="s0">tales. Listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting</span>
<span class="s0">with the object of his love at the Sukharev water tower. At the time</span>
<span class="s0">of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him--he had not</span>
<span class="s0">even once recalled it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting</span>
<span class="s0">had had in it something very important and poetic.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you,&quot; he now seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">her smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and</span>
<span class="s0">there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.</span>

<span class="s0">Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the</span>
<span class="s0">captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to</span>
<span class="s0">sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate</span>
<span class="s0">husband.</span>

<span class="s0">Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need</span>
<span class="s0">to express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that</span>
<span class="s0">he understood love for a women somewhat differently. He said that in</span>
<span class="s0">all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she</span>
<span class="s0">could never be his.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tiens!&quot; said the captain.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest</span>
<span class="s0">years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too</span>
<span class="s0">young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.</span>
<span class="s0">Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think</span>
<span class="s0">of her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything</span>
<span class="s0">in the world, and especially therefore above himself.</span>

<span class="s0">When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether</span>
<span class="s0">he understood that.</span>

<span class="s0">The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not</span>
<span class="s0">understand it he begged Pierre to continue.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Platonic love, clouds...&quot; he muttered.</span>

<span class="s0">Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or</span>
<span class="s0">the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of</span>
<span class="s0">those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these</span>
<span class="s0">things together, something loosened Pierre's tongue. Speaking</span>
<span class="s0">thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the whole</span>
<span class="s0">story of his life: his marriage, Natasha's love for his best friend,</span>
<span class="s0">her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her.</span>
<span class="s0">Urged on by Ramballe's questions he also told what he had at first</span>
<span class="s0">concealed--his own position and even his name.</span>

<span class="s0">More than anything else in Pierre's story the captain was</span>
<span class="s0">impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city,</span>
<span class="s0">but remained there concealing his name and station.</span>

<span class="s0">When it was late at night they went out together into the street.</span>
<span class="s0">The night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokrovka</span>
<span class="s0">a fire glowed--the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To</span>
<span class="s0">the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and</span>
<span class="s0">opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerasim, the cook, and</span>
<span class="s0">two Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible</span>
<span class="s0">remarks in two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow</span>
<span class="s0">seen in the town.</span>

<span class="s0">There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the</span>
<span class="s0">immense city.</span>

<span class="s0">Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the</span>
<span class="s0">glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. &quot;There now,</span>
<span class="s0">how good it is, what more does one need?&quot; thought he. And suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he</span>
<span class="s0">leaned against the fence to save himself from falling.</span>

<span class="s0">Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with</span>
<span class="s0">unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and</span>
<span class="s0">immediately fell asleep.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXX</span>


<span class="s0">The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was</span>
<span class="s0">watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the</span>
<span class="s0">retreating troops, with many different feelings.</span>

<span class="s0">The Rostov party spent the night at Mytishchi, fourteen miles from</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road</span>
<span class="s0">had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been</span>
<span class="s0">forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided</span>
<span class="s0">to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next</span>
<span class="s0">morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they</span>
<span class="s0">only got as far as Great Mytishchi. At ten o'clock that evening the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed</span>
<span class="s0">in the yards and huts of that large village. The Rostovs' servants and</span>
<span class="s0">coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to</span>
<span class="s0">their masters, had supper, fed the horses, and came out into the</span>
<span class="s0">porches.</span>

<span class="s0">In a neighboring hut lay Raevski's adjutant with a fractured</span>
<span class="s0">wrist. The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and</span>
<span class="s0">piteously, and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the</span>
<span class="s0">autumn night. He had spent the first night in the same yard as the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs. The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on</span>
<span class="s0">account of his moaning, and at Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut</span>
<span class="s0">simply to be farther away from the wounded man.</span>

<span class="s0">In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above</span>
<span class="s0">the high body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow</span>
<span class="s0">of another fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew</span>
<span class="s0">that it was Little Mytishchi burning--set on fire by Mamonov's</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But look here, brothers, there's another fire!&quot; remarked an</span>
<span class="s0">orderly.</span>

<span class="s0">All turned their attention to the glow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But they told us Little Mytishchi had been set on fire by Mamonov's</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But that's not Mytishchi, it's farther away.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look, it must be in Moscow!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and</span>
<span class="s0">sat down on its steps.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's more to the left, why, Little Mytishchi is over there, and</span>
<span class="s0">this is right on the other side.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Several men joined the first two.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;See how it's flaring,&quot; said one. &quot;That's a fire in Moscow: either</span>
<span class="s0">in the Sushchevski or the Rogozhski quarter.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed</span>
<span class="s0">silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.</span>

<span class="s0">Old Daniel Terentich, the count's valet (as he was called), came</span>
<span class="s0">up to the group and shouted at Mishka.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be</span>
<span class="s0">calling and there's nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I only ran out to get some water,&quot; said Mishka.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what do you think, Daniel Terentich? Doesn't it look as if that</span>
<span class="s0">glow were in Moscow?&quot; remarked one of the footmen.</span>

<span class="s0">Daniel Terentich made no reply, and again for a long time they</span>
<span class="s0">were all silent. The glow spread, rising and failing, farther and</span>
<span class="s0">farther still.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;God have mercy.... It's windy and dry...&quot; said another voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just look! See what it's doing now. O Lord! You can even see the</span>
<span class="s0">crows flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They'll put it out, no fear!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who's to put it out?&quot; Daniel Terentich, who had hitherto been</span>
<span class="s0">silent, was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. &quot;Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">it is, brothers,&quot; said he. &quot;Mother Moscow, the white...&quot; his voice</span>
<span class="s0">faltered, and he gave way to an old man's sob.</span>

<span class="s0">And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the</span>
<span class="s0">significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were</span>
<span class="s0">heard, words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count's old valet.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXI</span>


<span class="s0">The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow was burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to</span>
<span class="s0">look. Sonya and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out</span>
<span class="s0">with him. Only Natasha and the countess remained in the room. Petya</span>
<span class="s0">was no longer with the family, he had gone on with his regiment</span>
<span class="s0">which was making for Troitsa.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the</span>
<span class="s0">icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to</span>
<span class="s0">her father's words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of</span>
<span class="s0">the adjutant, three houses off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, how terrible,&quot; said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and</span>
<span class="s0">frightened. &quot;I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there's an awful</span>
<span class="s0">glow! Natasha, do look! You can see it from the window,&quot; she said to</span>
<span class="s0">her cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.</span>

<span class="s0">But Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to</span>
<span class="s0">her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had</span>
<span class="s0">been in this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sonya, to the</span>
<span class="s0">surprise and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable</span>
<span class="s0">reason found it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew's wound and</span>
<span class="s0">of his being with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry</span>
<span class="s0">with anyone as she was with Sonya. Sonya had cried and begged to be</span>
<span class="s0">forgiven and now, as if trying to atone for her fault, paid</span>
<span class="s0">unceasing attention to her cousin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look, Natasha, how dreadfully it is burning!&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's burning?&quot; asked Natasha. &quot;Oh, yes, Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her, she</span>
<span class="s0">turned her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was</span>
<span class="s0">evident that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her</span>
<span class="s0">former attitude.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you didn't see it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, really I did,&quot; Natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be</span>
<span class="s0">left in peace.</span>

<span class="s0">Both the countess and Sonya understood that, naturally, neither</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of</span>
<span class="s0">importance to Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess</span>
<span class="s0">went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand</span>
<span class="s0">as she was wont to do when Natasha was ill, then touched her</span>
<span class="s0">forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and</span>
<span class="s0">finally kissed her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are cold. You are trembling all over. You'd better lie down,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lie down? All right, I will. I'll lie down at once,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was</span>
<span class="s0">seriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first</span>
<span class="s0">asked many questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it</span>
<span class="s0">serious? And could she see him? But after she had been told that she</span>
<span class="s0">could not see him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was</span>
<span class="s0">not in danger, she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently disbelieving what they told her, and convinced that say what</span>
<span class="s0">she might she would still be told the same. All the way she had sat</span>
<span class="s0">motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the</span>
<span class="s0">expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much,</span>
<span class="s0">and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated</span>
<span class="s0">herself on arriving. She was planning something and either deciding or</span>
<span class="s0">had already decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but</span>
<span class="s0">what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame</span>
<span class="s0">Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,&quot; Natasha replied</span>
<span class="s0">irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open</span>
<span class="s0">window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She</span>
<span class="s0">put her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her</span>
<span class="s0">slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut</span>
<span class="s0">across the passage; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her</span>
<span class="s0">sob. The countess exchanged a look with Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,&quot; said the countess, softly</span>
<span class="s0">touching Natasha's shoulders. &quot;Come, lie down.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes... I'll lie down at once,&quot; said Natasha, and began</span>
<span class="s0">hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.</span>

<span class="s0">When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket,</span>
<span class="s0">she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made</span>
<span class="s0">up on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the</span>
<span class="s0">front, and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved</span>
<span class="s0">from side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked</span>
<span class="s0">fixedly before her. When her toilet for the night was finished she</span>
<span class="s0">sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the</span>
<span class="s0">door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, you'd better lie in the middle,&quot; said Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll stay here,&quot; muttered Natasha. &quot;Do lie down,&quot; she added</span>
<span class="s0">crossly, and buried her face in the pillow.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undressed hastily and lay</span>
<span class="s0">down. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left</span>
<span class="s0">in the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little</span>
<span class="s0">Mytishchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise</span>
<span class="s0">of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov's Cossacks had set up across</span>
<span class="s0">the street, and the adjutant's unceasing moans could still be heard.</span>

<span class="s0">For a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds that</span>
<span class="s0">reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First</span>
<span class="s0">she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed</span>
<span class="s0">under her, then Madame Schoss' familiar whistling snore and Sonya's</span>
<span class="s0">gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natasha. Natasha did not</span>
<span class="s0">answer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think she's asleep, Mamma,&quot; said Sonya softly.</span>

<span class="s0">After short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one</span>
<span class="s0">replied.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after that Natasha heard her mother's even breathing. Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">did not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the</span>
<span class="s0">quilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.</span>

<span class="s0">As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in</span>
<span class="s0">a crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near</span>
<span class="s0">by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of</span>
<span class="s0">the adjutant was heard. Natasha sat up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, are you asleep? Mamma?&quot; she whispered.</span>

<span class="s0">No one replied. Natasha rose slowly and carefully, crossed</span>
<span class="s0">herself, and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her</span>
<span class="s0">slim, supple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping</span>
<span class="s0">cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few</span>
<span class="s0">steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle.</span>

<span class="s0">It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically</span>
<span class="s0">against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking</span>
<span class="s0">with alarm and terror and overflowing with love.</span>

<span class="s0">She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the</span>
<span class="s0">cold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed</span>
<span class="s0">her. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over</span>
<span class="s0">him, and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew lay. It was dark in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench</span>
<span class="s0">beside a bed on which something was lying, stood a tallow candle</span>
<span class="s0">with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.</span>

<span class="s0">From the moment she had been told that of Prince Andrew's wound</span>
<span class="s0">and his presence there, Natasha had resolved to see him. She did not</span>
<span class="s0">know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt</span>
<span class="s0">the more convinced that it was necessary.</span>

<span class="s0">All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now</span>
<span class="s0">that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might</span>
<span class="s0">see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that</span>
<span class="s0">incessant moaning of the adjutant's? Yes, he was altogether like that.</span>
<span class="s0">In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When</span>
<span class="s0">she saw an indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees</span>
<span class="s0">raised under the quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body</span>
<span class="s0">there, and stood still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her</span>
<span class="s0">forward. She cautiously took one step and then another, and found</span>
<span class="s0">herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage. Another man-</span>
<span class="s0">Timokhin--was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons,</span>
<span class="s0">and two others--the doctor and a valet--lay on the floor.</span>

<span class="s0">The valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, kept awake by</span>
<span class="s0">the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange</span>
<span class="s0">apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and</span>
<span class="s0">nightcap. The valet's sleepy, frightened exclamation, &quot;What do you</span>
<span class="s0">want? What's the matter?&quot; made Natasha approach more swiftly to what</span>
<span class="s0">was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked,</span>
<span class="s0">she must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle</span>
<span class="s0">wick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the</span>
<span class="s0">quilt, and such as she had always seen him.</span>

<span class="s0">He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his</span>
<span class="s0">glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his</span>
<span class="s0">neck, delicate as a child's, revealed by the turn-down collar of his</span>
<span class="s0">shirt, gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had</span>
<span class="s0">never seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift,</span>
<span class="s0">flexible, youthful movement dropped on her knees.</span>

<span class="s0">He smiled and held out his hand to her.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXII</span>


<span class="s0">Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the</span>
<span class="s0">ambulance station on the field of Borodino. His feverish state and the</span>
<span class="s0">inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor's</span>

<span class="s0">opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that</span>
<span class="s0">his temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.</span>
<span class="s0">The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had</span>
<span class="s0">remained in the caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself</span>
<span class="s0">asked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his</span>
<span class="s0">removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a</span>
<span class="s0">long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened them and</span>
<span class="s0">whispered softly: &quot;And the tea?&quot; His remembering such a small detail</span>
<span class="s0">of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew's pulse,</span>
<span class="s0">and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He</span>
<span class="s0">was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did</span>
<span class="s0">not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering.</span>
<span class="s0">Timokhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew's regiment, had</span>
<span class="s0">joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been</span>
<span class="s0">wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino. They were accompanied by</span>
<span class="s0">a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.</span>

<span class="s0">They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking</span>
<span class="s0">with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to</span>
<span class="s0">understand and remember something.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't want any more. Is Timokhin here?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Timokhin crept along the bench to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am here, your excellency.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How's your wound?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Couldn't one get a book?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What book?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Gospels. I haven't one.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he</span>
<span class="s0">was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly</span>
<span class="s0">but reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him</span>
<span class="s0">as he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted</span>
<span class="s0">the cloak with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the</span>
<span class="s0">noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began</span>
<span class="s0">examining that dreadful place. The doctor was very much displeased</span>
<span class="s0">about something and made a change in the dressings, turning the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and</span>
<span class="s0">delirious from the agony. He kept asking them to get him the book</span>
<span class="s0">and put it under him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What trouble would it be to you?&quot; he said. &quot;I have not got one.</span>
<span class="s0">Please get it for me and put it under for a moment,&quot; he pleaded in a</span>
<span class="s0">piteous voice.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You fellows have no conscience,&quot; said he to the valet who was</span>
<span class="s0">pouring water over his hands. &quot;For just one moment I didn't look after</span>
<span class="s0">you... It's such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under</span>
<span class="s0">him!&quot; said the valet.</span>

<span class="s0">The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was</span>
<span class="s0">the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he</span>
<span class="s0">asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at</span>
<span class="s0">Mytishchi. After growing confused from pain while being carried into</span>
<span class="s0">the hut he again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once</span>
<span class="s0">more recalled all that had happened to him, and above all vividly</span>
<span class="s0">remembered the moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of</span>
<span class="s0">the sufferings of a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to</span>
<span class="s0">him which promised him happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague</span>
<span class="s0">and indefinite, again possessed his soul. He remembered that he had</span>
<span class="s0">now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to</span>
<span class="s0">do with the Gospels. That was why he asked for a copy of them. The</span>
<span class="s0">uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over</span>
<span class="s0">again confused his thoughts, and when he came to himself a third</span>
<span class="s0">time it was in the complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him</span>
<span class="s0">was sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was</span>
<span class="s0">shouting and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the</span>
<span class="s0">table, on the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the</span>
<span class="s0">head of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick of which</span>
<span class="s0">was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.</span>

<span class="s0">His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,</span>
<span class="s0">feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the</span>
<span class="s0">power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which</span>
<span class="s0">to fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from</span>
<span class="s0">the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in</span>
<span class="s0">and can then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew's</span>
<span class="s0">mind was not in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of</span>
<span class="s0">his mind were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted</span>
<span class="s0">apart from his will. Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him</span>
<span class="s0">simultaneously. At times his brain suddenly began to work with a</span>
<span class="s0">vigor, clearness, and depth it had never reached when he was in</span>
<span class="s0">health, but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some</span>
<span class="s0">unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be</span>
<span class="s0">deprived,&quot; he thought as he lay in the semi-darkness of the quiet hut,</span>
<span class="s0">gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. &quot;A happiness</span>
<span class="s0">lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act</span>
<span class="s0">on man--a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving.</span>
<span class="s0">Every man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was</span>
<span class="s0">possible only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was</span>
<span class="s0">the Son...?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality)</span>
<span class="s0">a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;piti-piti-piti,&quot; and then &quot;titi,&quot; and then again &quot;piti-piti-piti,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and &quot;ti-ti&quot; once more. At the same time he felt that above his face,</span>
<span class="s0">above the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being</span>
<span class="s0">erected out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this</span>
<span class="s0">whispered music. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it</span>
<span class="s0">was difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but</span>
<span class="s0">nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound</span>
<span class="s0">of whispered rhythmic music--&quot;it stretches, stretches, spreading out</span>
<span class="s0">and stretching,&quot; said Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to</span>
<span class="s0">this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and</span>
<span class="s0">the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a</span>
<span class="s0">red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and</span>
<span class="s0">the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face.</span>
<span class="s0">Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and</span>
<span class="s0">yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though it</span>
<span class="s0">knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But</span>
<span class="s0">besides this there was something else of importance. It was</span>
<span class="s0">something white by the door--the statue of a sphinx, which also</span>
<span class="s0">oppressed him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But perhaps that's my shirt on the table,&quot; he thought, &quot;and</span>
<span class="s0">that's my legs, and that is the door, but why is it always</span>
<span class="s0">stretching and drawing itself out, and 'piti-piti-piti' and 'ti-ti'</span>
<span class="s0">and 'piti-piti-piti'...? That's enough, please leave off!&quot; Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings</span>
<span class="s0">again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and</span>
<span class="s0">force.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes--love,&quot; he thought again quite clearly. &quot;But not love which</span>
<span class="s0">loves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some</span>
<span class="s0">reason, but the love which I--while dying--first experienced when I</span>
<span class="s0">saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love</span>
<span class="s0">which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an</span>
<span class="s0">object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one's neighbors, to</span>
<span class="s0">love one's enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His</span>
<span class="s0">manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with</span>
<span class="s0">human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why</span>
<span class="s0">I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has</span>
<span class="s0">become of him? Is he alive?...</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but</span>
<span class="s0">divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can</span>
<span class="s0">destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people</span>
<span class="s0">have I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as</span>
<span class="s0">I did her.&quot; And he vividly pictured to himself Natasha, not as he</span>
<span class="s0">had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him</span>
<span class="s0">delight, but for the first time picturing to himself her soul. And</span>
<span class="s0">he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now</span>
<span class="s0">understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her,</span>
<span class="s0">the cruelty of his rupture with her. &quot;If only it were possible for</span>
<span class="s0">me to see her once more! Just once, looking into those eyes to say...&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!&quot; flopped the</span>
<span class="s0">fly... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a</span>
<span class="s0">world of reality and delirium in which something particular was</span>
<span class="s0">happening. In that world some structure was still being erected and</span>
<span class="s0">did not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle</span>
<span class="s0">with its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay</span>
<span class="s0">near the door; but besides all this something creaked, there was a</span>
<span class="s0">whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the</span>
<span class="s0">door. And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha of whom he had just been thinking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,&quot; thought Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew, trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face</span>
<span class="s0">remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer.</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew wished to return that former world of pure thought,</span>
<span class="s0">but he could not, and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft</span>
<span class="s0">whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed</span>
<span class="s0">him and stretched out, and the strange face was before him. Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his</span>
<span class="s0">senses, he moved a little, and suddenly there was a ringing in his</span>
<span class="s0">ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like a man plunged into water he lost</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness. When he came to himself, Natasha, that same living</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure</span>
<span class="s0">divine love that had been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He</span>
<span class="s0">realized that it was the real living Natasha, and he was not surprised</span>
<span class="s0">but quietly happy. Natasha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to</span>
<span class="s0">stir), with frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her</span>
<span class="s0">sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it</span>
<span class="s0">something quivered.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You?&quot; he said. &quot;How fortunate!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">With a rapid but careful movement Natasha drew nearer to him on</span>
<span class="s0">her knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and</span>
<span class="s0">began kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive me!&quot; she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I love you,&quot; said Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive...!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive what?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!&quot; faltered Natasha in a</span>
<span class="s0">scarcely audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly, just touching it with her lips.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I love you more, better than before,&quot; said Prince Andrew, lifting</span>
<span class="s0">her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,</span>
<span class="s0">compassionately, and with joyous love. Natasha's thin pale face,</span>
<span class="s0">with its swollen lips, was more than plain--it was dreadful. But</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful. They heard the sound of voices behind them.</span>

<span class="s0">Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.</span>
<span class="s0">Timokhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had</span>
<span class="s0">long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his</span>
<span class="s0">bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's this?&quot; said the doctor, rising from his bed. &quot;Please go</span>
<span class="s0">away, madam!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her</span>
<span class="s0">daughter's absence, knocked at the door.</span>

<span class="s0">Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out of the</span>
<span class="s0">room and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.</span>


<span class="s0">From that time, during all the rest of the Rostovs' journey, at</span>
<span class="s0">every halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natasha never</span>
<span class="s0">left the wounded Bolkonski, and the doctor had to admit that he had</span>
<span class="s0">not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in</span>
<span class="s0">nursing a wounded man.</span>

<span class="s0">Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">die in her daughter's arms during the journey--as, judging by what the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor said, it seemed might easily happen--she could not oppose</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. Though with the intimacy now established between the</span>
<span class="s0">wounded man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover</span>
<span class="s0">their former engagement would be renewed, no one--least of all Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">and Prince Andrew--spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and</span>
<span class="s0">death, which hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia, shut</span>
<span class="s0">out all other considerations.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>


<span class="s0">On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching,</span>
<span class="s0">the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt</span>
<span class="s0">uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of</span>
<span class="s0">something shameful he had done the day before. That something shameful</span>
<span class="s0">was his yesterday's conversation with Captain Ramballe.</span>

<span class="s0">It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of</span>
<span class="s0">doors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an</span>
<span class="s0">engraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table, he</span>
<span class="s0">remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Am I not too late?&quot; he thought. &quot;No, probably he won't make his</span>
<span class="s0">entry into Moscow before noon.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him,</span>
<span class="s0">but hastened to act.</span>

<span class="s0">After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to</span>
<span class="s0">go out. But it then occurred to him for the first time that he</span>
<span class="s0">certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the</span>
<span class="s0">streets. It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his</span>
<span class="s0">wide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his</span>
<span class="s0">arm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not had time to</span>
<span class="s0">reload it. &quot;No matter, dagger will do,&quot; he said to himself, though</span>
<span class="s0">when planning his design he had more than once come to the</span>
<span class="s0">conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been</span>
<span class="s0">to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as his chief aim</span>
<span class="s0">consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself</span>
<span class="s0">that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could</span>
<span class="s0">to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a</span>
<span class="s0">green sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the</span>
<span class="s0">pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.</span>

<span class="s0">Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his</span>
<span class="s0">head, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or</span>
<span class="s0">meeting the captain, and passed out into the street.</span>

<span class="s0">The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much</span>
<span class="s0">indifference the evening before, had greatly increased during the</span>
<span class="s0">night. Moscow was on fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage</span>
<span class="s0">Row, across the river, in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as the</span>
<span class="s0">barges on the Moskva River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov</span>
<span class="s0">Bridge, were all ablaze.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from</span>
<span class="s0">there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat, where he had long</span>
<span class="s0">before decided that the deed should should be done. The gates of</span>
<span class="s0">most of the houses were locked and the shutters up. The streets and</span>
<span class="s0">lanes were deserted. The air was full of smoke and the smell of</span>
<span class="s0">burning. Now and then he met Russians with anxious and timid faces,</span>
<span class="s0">and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp, walking</span>
<span class="s0">in the middle of the streets. Both the Russians and the French</span>
<span class="s0">looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his height and stoutness,</span>
<span class="s0">and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure,</span>
<span class="s0">the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to</span>
<span class="s0">what class he could belong. The French followed him with</span>
<span class="s0">astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the</span>
<span class="s0">other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid</span>
<span class="s0">no attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who</span>
<span class="s0">were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand</span>
<span class="s0">them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel</span>
<span class="s0">standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the</span>
<span class="s0">shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man's</span>
<span class="s0">musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on</span>
<span class="s0">the other side of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what</span>
<span class="s0">went on around him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror</span>
<span class="s0">and haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the</span>
<span class="s0">previous night's experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was</span>
<span class="s0">not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had</span>
<span class="s0">he not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not</span>
<span class="s0">now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than</span>
<span class="s0">four hours previously on his way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the</span>
<span class="s0">Kremlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal</span>
<span class="s0">study in the Kremlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to</span>
<span class="s0">measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent</span>
<span class="s0">looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know</span>
<span class="s0">this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was</span>
<span class="s0">tortured--as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is</span>
<span class="s0">impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its</span>
<span class="s0">incompatibility with their natures--by the fear of weakening at the</span>
<span class="s0">decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.</span>

<span class="s0">Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by</span>
<span class="s0">instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the</span>
<span class="s0">Povarskoy.</span>

<span class="s0">As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser-</span>
<span class="s0">he even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame</span>
<span class="s0">rose from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the</span>
<span class="s0">streets and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that</span>
<span class="s0">something unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he</span>
<span class="s0">was approaching the fire. As he was going along a foot path across a</span>
<span class="s0">wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens of</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Gruzinski's house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the</span>
<span class="s0">desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if</span>
<span class="s0">awakening from a dream and lifted his head.</span>

<span class="s0">By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of</span>
<span class="s0">household goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and</span>
<span class="s0">trunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer</span>
<span class="s0">young, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and</span>
<span class="s0">cap. This woman, swaying to and fro and muttering something, was</span>
<span class="s0">choking with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty</span>
<span class="s0">short frocks and cloaks, were staring at their mother with a look of</span>
<span class="s0">stupefaction on their pale frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy</span>
<span class="s0">of about seven, who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently</span>
<span class="s0">not his own, was crying in his old nurse's arms. A dirty, barefooted</span>
<span class="s0">maid was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her pale-colored</span>
<span class="s0">plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair. The</span>
<span class="s0">woman's husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the undress</span>
<span class="s0">uniform of a civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and</span>
<span class="s0">showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward</span>
<span class="s0">over his temples, with expressionless face was moving the trunks,</span>
<span class="s0">which were placed one on another, and was dragging some garments</span>
<span class="s0">from under them.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his</span>
<span class="s0">feet.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends...</span>
<span class="s0">help us, somebody,&quot; she muttered between her sobs. &quot;My girl... My</span>
<span class="s0">daughter! My youngest daughter is left behind. She's burned! Ooh!</span>
<span class="s0">Was it for this I nursed you.... Ooh!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't, Mary Nikolievna!&quot; said her husband to her in a low voice,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. &quot;Sister must</span>
<span class="s0">have taken her, or else where can she be?&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Monster! Villain!&quot; shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to</span>
<span class="s0">weep. &quot;You have no heart, you don't feel for your own child! Another</span>
<span class="s0">man would have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and</span>
<span class="s0">neither a man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">went on, addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. &quot;The fire broke</span>
<span class="s0">out alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out 'Fire!' and we</span>
<span class="s0">rushed to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is</span>
<span class="s0">what we have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the</span>
<span class="s0">rest is lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O</span>
<span class="s0">Lord!...&quot; and again she began to sob. &quot;My child, my dear one!</span>
<span class="s0">Burned, burned!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But where was she left?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man</span>
<span class="s0">might help her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, dear sir!&quot; she cried, seizing him by the legs. &quot;My</span>
<span class="s0">benefactor, set my heart at ease.... Aniska, go, you horrid girl, show</span>
<span class="s0">him the way!&quot; she cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and</span>
<span class="s0">still farther exposing her long teeth.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Show me the way, show me, I... I'll do it,&quot; gasped Pierre rapidly.</span>

<span class="s0">The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her</span>
<span class="s0">plait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his</span>
<span class="s0">head higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift</span>
<span class="s0">steps he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the</span>
<span class="s0">Povarskoy. The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues</span>
<span class="s0">of flame here and there broke through that cloud. A great number of</span>
<span class="s0">people crowded in front of the conflagration. In the middle of the</span>
<span class="s0">street stood a French general saying something to those around him.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing to the spot where the</span>
<span class="s0">general stood, but the French soldiers stopped him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On ne passe pas!&quot;* cried a voice.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;You can't pass!</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;This way, uncle,&quot; cried the girl. &quot;We'll pass through the side</span>
<span class="s0">street, by the Nikulins'!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with</span>
<span class="s0">her. She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left,</span>
<span class="s0">and, passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's here, close by,&quot; said she and, running across the yard, opened</span>
<span class="s0">a gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small</span>
<span class="s0">wooden wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One</span>
<span class="s0">of its sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames</span>
<span class="s0">issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof.</span>

<span class="s0">As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air</span>
<span class="s0">and involuntarily stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Which is it? Which is your house?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ooh!&quot; wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. &quot;That's it, that was</span>
<span class="s0">our lodging. You've burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my</span>
<span class="s0">precious little missy! Ooh!&quot; lamented Aniska, who at the sight of</span>
<span class="s0">the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house</span>
<span class="s0">that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and</span>
<span class="s0">around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not</span>
<span class="s0">realize what these men, who were dragging something out, were about;</span>
<span class="s0">but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber</span>
<span class="s0">and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that</span>
<span class="s0">looting was going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.</span>

<span class="s0">The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings,</span>
<span class="s0">the whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the</span>
<span class="s0">people, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick</span>
<span class="s0">black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here</span>
<span class="s0">and there dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish</span>
<span class="s0">scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke and</span>
<span class="s0">rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating effects</span>
<span class="s0">of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because</span>
<span class="s0">at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas</span>
<span class="s0">that had weighed him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and</span>
<span class="s0">resolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to</span>
<span class="s0">dash into that part of it which was still standing, when just above</span>
<span class="s0">his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound</span>
<span class="s0">and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with</span>
<span class="s0">metal articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the</span>
<span class="s0">drawer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What does this fellow want?&quot; shouted one of them referring to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There's a child in that house. Haven't you seen a child?&quot; cried</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's he talking about? Get along!&quot; said several voices, and one</span>
<span class="s0">of the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take</span>
<span class="s0">from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved</span>
<span class="s0">threateningly toward him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A child?&quot; shouted a Frenchman from above. &quot;I did hear something</span>
<span class="s0">squealing in the garden. Perhaps it's his brat that the fellow is</span>
<span class="s0">looking for. After all, one must be human, you know....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is it? Where?&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There! There!&quot; shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the</span>
<span class="s0">garden at the back of the house. &quot;Wait a bit--I'm coming down.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with</span>
<span class="s0">a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window</span>
<span class="s0">on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with</span>
<span class="s0">him into the garden.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hurry up, you others!&quot; he called out to his comrades. &quot;It's getting</span>
<span class="s0">hot.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman</span>
<span class="s0">pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space</span>
<span class="s0">where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman. &quot;Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you</span>
<span class="s0">know!&quot; and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his</span>
<span class="s0">comrades.</span>

<span class="s0">Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going</span>
<span class="s0">to take her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly,</span>
<span class="s0">scrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her mother, began to</span>
<span class="s0">yell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his</span>
<span class="s0">arms. She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little</span>
<span class="s0">hands to pull Pierre's hands away and to bite them with her slobbering</span>
<span class="s0">mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he</span>
<span class="s0">had experienced when touching some nasty little animal. But he made an</span>
<span class="s0">effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large</span>
<span class="s0">house. It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he had</span>
<span class="s0">come; the maid, Aniska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a feeling</span>
<span class="s0">of pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully sobbing child to</span>
<span class="s0">himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden</span>
<span class="s0">seeking another way out.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>


<span class="s0">Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back</span>
<span class="s0">with his little burden to the Gruzinski garden at the corner of the</span>
<span class="s0">Povarskoy. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had</span>
<span class="s0">set out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and</span>
<span class="s0">goods that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian</span>
<span class="s0">families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their</span>
<span class="s0">belongings, there were several French soldiers in a variety of</span>
<span class="s0">clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried to find the family</span>
<span class="s0">of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother</span>
<span class="s0">and go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to</span>
<span class="s0">do and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from running, he</span>
<span class="s0">felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth,</span>
<span class="s0">animation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to</span>
<span class="s0">save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging with her little</span>
<span class="s0">hands to Pierre's coat, sat on his arm gazing about her like some</span>
<span class="s0">little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight</span>
<span class="s0">smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that</span>
<span class="s0">frightened, sickly little face.</span>

<span class="s0">He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left</span>
<span class="s0">them. He walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various</span>
<span class="s0">faces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family</span>
<span class="s0">consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,</span>
<span class="s0">cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar</span>
<span class="s0">type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the</span>
<span class="s0">perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,</span>
<span class="s0">black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the</span>
<span class="s0">crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright</span>
<span class="s0">lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown</span>
<span class="s0">out onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the</span>
<span class="s0">old woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless,</span>
<span class="s0">large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she</span>
<span class="s0">was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre and, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to</span>
<span class="s0">look at her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding</span>
<span class="s0">those he sought, he stopped and looked about him.</span>

<span class="s0">With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous</span>
<span class="s0">than before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered</span>
<span class="s0">about him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You're of the gentry</span>
<span class="s0">yourself, aren't you? Whose child is it?&quot; they asked him.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat</span>
<span class="s0">who had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked</span>
<span class="s0">whether anyone knew where she had gone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, that must be the Anferovs,&quot; said an old deacon, addressing a</span>
<span class="s0">pockmarked peasant woman. &quot;Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!&quot; he added</span>
<span class="s0">in his customary bass.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Anferovs? No,&quot; said the woman. &quot;They left in the morning.</span>
<span class="s0">That must be either Mary Nikolievna's or the Ivanovs'!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He says 'a woman,' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady,&quot; remarked a house</span>
<span class="s0">serf.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know her? She's thin, with long teeth,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's Mary Nikolievna! They went inside the garden when these</span>
<span class="s0">wolves swooped down,&quot; said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord, have mercy!&quot; added the deacon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go over that way, they're there. It's she! She kept on lamenting</span>
<span class="s0">and crying,&quot; continued the woman. &quot;It's she. Here, this way!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds</span>
<span class="s0">been intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was</span>
<span class="s0">looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone</span>
<span class="s0">up to them. One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat</span>
<span class="s0">tied round the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and</span>
<span class="s0">his feet were bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre, was a long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in</span>
<span class="s0">his movements and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a</span>
<span class="s0">woman's loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian</span>
<span class="s0">boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the</span>
<span class="s0">Armenians and, saying something, immediately seized the old man by his</span>
<span class="s0">legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in</span>
<span class="s0">the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and</span>
<span class="s0">with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and</span>
<span class="s0">silent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here, take the child!&quot; said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to</span>
<span class="s0">the woman, handing the little girl to her. &quot;Give her back to them,</span>
<span class="s0">give her back!&quot; he almost shouted, putting the child, who began</span>
<span class="s0">screaming, on the ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the</span>
<span class="s0">Armenian family.</span>

<span class="s0">The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had</span>
<span class="s0">secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.</span>
<span class="s0">The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to</span>
<span class="s0">the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from</span>
<span class="s0">side to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands</span>
<span class="s0">from his pockets had seized her by the neck.</span>

<span class="s0">The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same</span>
<span class="s0">attitude, with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or</span>
<span class="s0">feel what the soldier was doing to her.</span>

<span class="s0">While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing</span>
<span class="s0">from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the</span>
<span class="s0">young woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let that woman alone!&quot; exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious</span>
<span class="s0">voice, seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him</span>
<span class="s0">aside.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing</span>
<span class="s0">down the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Voyons, Pas de betises!&quot;* he cried.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Look here, no nonsense!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing</span>
<span class="s0">and his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked</span>
<span class="s0">him off his feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval</span>
<span class="s0">were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted</span>
<span class="s0">patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans</span>
<span class="s0">came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only</span>
<span class="s0">remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that</span>
<span class="s0">his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood</span>
<span class="s0">around him and were searching him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lieutenant, he has a dagger,&quot; were the first words Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">understood.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, a weapon?&quot; said the officer and turned to the barefooted</span>
<span class="s0">soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. &quot;All right, you can tell</span>
<span class="s0">all about it at the court-martial.&quot; Then he turned to Pierre. &quot;Do</span>
<span class="s0">you speak French?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply.</span>
<span class="s0">His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something</span>
<span class="s0">in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves</span>
<span class="s0">on both sides of Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you speak French?&quot; the officer asked again, keeping at a</span>
<span class="s0">distance from Pierre. &quot;Call the interpreter.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks,</span>
<span class="s0">and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to</span>
<span class="s0">be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He does not look like a common man,&quot; said the interpreter, after</span>
<span class="s0">a searching look at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,&quot; remarked the officer.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And ask him who he is,&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the interpreter in poor Russian. &quot;You must</span>
<span class="s0">answer the chief.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner--take me!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre suddenly replied in French.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, ah!&quot; muttered the officer with a frown. &quot;Well then, march!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood</span>
<span class="s0">the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol</span>
<span class="s0">started she moved forward.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?&quot; said she. &quot;And the</span>
<span class="s0">little girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she's not</span>
<span class="s0">theirs?&quot; said the woman.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What does that woman want?&quot; asked the officer.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight</span>
<span class="s0">of the little girl he had saved.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What does she want?&quot; he murmured. &quot;She is bringing me my daughter</span>
<span class="s0">whom I have just saved from the flames,&quot; said he. &quot;Good-by!&quot; And</span>
<span class="s0">without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along</span>
<span class="s0">with resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various</span>
<span class="s0">streets of Moscow by Durosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage,</span>
<span class="s0">and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general</span>
<span class="s0">opinion which had that day originated among the higher French</span>
<span class="s0">officers, were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through</span>
<span class="s0">a number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects:</span>
<span class="s0">a small shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house</span>
<span class="s0">serf, besides several looters. But of all these various suspected</span>
<span class="s0">characters, Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all.</span>
<span class="s0">When they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the</span>
<span class="s0">Zubov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed</span>
<span class="s0">apart under strict guard.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK TWELVE: 1812</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being</span>
<span class="s0">carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between</span>
<span class="s0">the parties of Rumyantsev, the French, Marya Fedorovna, the Tsarevich,</span>
<span class="s0">and others, drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But</span>
<span class="s0">the calm, luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about</span>
<span class="s0">phantoms and reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made</span>
<span class="s0">it hard, except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the</span>
<span class="s0">difficult position of the Russian people. There were the same</span>
<span class="s0">receptions and balls, the same French theater, the same court</span>
<span class="s0">interests and service interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the</span>
<span class="s0">very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the</span>
<span class="s0">difficulties of the actual position. Stories were whispered of how</span>
<span class="s0">differently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult</span>
<span class="s0">circumstances. The Empress Marya, concerned for the welfare of the</span>
<span class="s0">charitable and educational institutions under her patronage, had given</span>
<span class="s0">directions that they should all be removed to Kazan, and the things</span>
<span class="s0">belonging to these institutions had already been packed up. The</span>
<span class="s0">Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions she would</span>
<span class="s0">be pleased to give--with her characteristic Russian patriotism had</span>
<span class="s0">replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for</span>
<span class="s0">that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally was</span>
<span class="s0">concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.</span>

<span class="s0">At Anna Pavlovna's on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of</span>
<span class="s0">the battle of Borodino, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which</span>
<span class="s0">was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when</span>
<span class="s0">sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was</span>
<span class="s0">regarded as a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Vasili himself, famed for his elocution, was to read it. (He used to</span>
<span class="s0">read at the Empress'.) The art of his reading was supposed to lie in</span>
<span class="s0">rolling out the words, quite independently of their meaning, in a loud</span>
<span class="s0">and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a</span>
<span class="s0">tender murmur, so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and</span>
<span class="s0">the murmur on another. This reading, as was always the case at Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Pavlovna's soirees, had a political significance. That evening she</span>
<span class="s0">expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of</span>
<span class="s0">their visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic</span>
<span class="s0">temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna Pavlovna, not</span>
<span class="s0">yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room, did not</span>
<span class="s0">let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general</span>
<span class="s0">conversation.</span>

<span class="s0">The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess</span>
<span class="s0">Bezukhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously,</span>
<span class="s0">had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament, and</span>
<span class="s0">was said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to</span>
<span class="s0">some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way.</span>

<span class="s0">They all knew very well that the enchanting countess' illness</span>
<span class="s0">arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at</span>
<span class="s0">the same time, and that the Italian's cure consisted in removing</span>
<span class="s0">such inconvenience; but in Anna Pavlovna's presence no one dared to</span>
<span class="s0">think of this or even appear to know it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is</span>
<span class="s0">angina pectoris.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Angina? Oh, that's a terrible illness!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor told him the case was dangerous.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are speaking of the poor countess?&quot; said Anna Pavlovna,</span>
<span class="s0">coming up just then. &quot;I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a</span>
<span class="s0">little better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the</span>
<span class="s0">world,&quot; she went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. &quot;We belong to</span>
<span class="s0">different camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she</span>
<span class="s0">deserves. She is very unfortunate!&quot; added Anna Pavlovna.</span>

<span class="s0">Supposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting the</span>
<span class="s0">veil from the secret of the countess' malady, an unwary young man</span>
<span class="s0">ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been</span>
<span class="s0">called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan</span>
<span class="s0">who might employ dangerous remedies.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your information maybe better than mine,&quot; Anna Pavlovna suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, &quot;but I know on</span>
<span class="s0">good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He</span>
<span class="s0">is private physician to the Queen of Spain.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pavlovna turned to</span>
<span class="s0">another group where Bilibin was talking about the Austrians: having</span>
<span class="s0">wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again</span>
<span class="s0">and utter one of his mots.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I think it is delightful,&quot; he said, referring to a diplomatic</span>
<span class="s0">note that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners</span>
<span class="s0">captured from the French by Wittgenstein, &quot;the hero of Petropol&quot; as he</span>
<span class="s0">was then called in Petersburg.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What's that?&quot; asked Anna Pavlovna, securing silence for the</span>
<span class="s0">mot, which she had heard before.</span>

<span class="s0">And Bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch,</span>
<span class="s0">which he had himself composed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor returns these Austrian banners,&quot; said Bilibin,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,&quot; and his brow</span>
<span class="s0">became smooth again.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Charming, charming!&quot; observed Prince Vasili.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The path to Warsaw, perhaps,&quot; Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly</span>
<span class="s0">and unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he</span>
<span class="s0">meant. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise.</span>
<span class="s0">He knew no more than the others what his words meant. During his</span>
<span class="s0">diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances</span>
<span class="s0">were received as very witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in</span>
<span class="s0">that way the first words that entered his head. &quot;It may turn out</span>
<span class="s0">very well,&quot; he thought, &quot;but if not, they'll know how to arrange</span>
<span class="s0">matters.&quot; And really, during the awkward silence that ensued, that</span>
<span class="s0">insufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been</span>
<span class="s0">waiting for and wished to convert, and she, smiling and shaking a</span>
<span class="s0">finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince Vasili to the table and bringing</span>
<span class="s0">him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone</span>
<span class="s0">became silent.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!&quot; Prince Vasili sternly</span>
<span class="s0">declaimed, looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether</span>
<span class="s0">anyone had anything to say to the contrary. But no one said</span>
<span class="s0">anything. &quot;Moscow, our ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives</span>
<span class="s0">her Christ&quot;--he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her--&quot;as a mother</span>
<span class="s0">receives her zealous sons into her arms, and through the gathering</span>
<span class="s0">mists, foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule, sings in</span>
<span class="s0">exultation, 'Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh!'&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Bilibin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present</span>
<span class="s0">appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Pavlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman</span>
<span class="s0">muttering the prayer at Communion: &quot;Let the bold and insolent</span>
<span class="s0">Goliath...&quot; she whispered.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Vasili continued.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France</span>
<span class="s0">encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble</span>
<span class="s0">Faith, the sling of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head</span>
<span class="s0">in his blood-thirsty pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the</span>
<span class="s0">servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country's weal, is</span>
<span class="s0">offered to Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength</span>
<span class="s0">prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence. I</span>
<span class="s0">raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race</span>
<span class="s0">of the just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;What force! What a style!&quot; was uttered in approval both of reader</span>
<span class="s0">and of author.</span>

<span class="s0">Animated by that address Anna Pavlovna's guests talked for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as</span>
<span class="s0">to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You will see,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna, &quot;that tomorrow, on the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day</span>
<span class="s0">during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">birthday, Prince Volkonski was called out of the church and received a</span>
<span class="s0">dispatch from Prince Kutuzov. It was Kutuzov's report, written from</span>
<span class="s0">Tatarinova on the day of the battle. Kutuzov wrote that the Russians</span>
<span class="s0">had not retreated a step, that the French losses were much heavier</span>
<span class="s0">than ours, and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle</span>
<span class="s0">before collecting full information. It followed that there must have</span>
<span class="s0">been a victory. And at once, without leaving the church, thanks were</span>
<span class="s0">rendered to the Creator for His help and for the victory.</span>

<span class="s0">Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was justified, and all that morning a</span>
<span class="s0">joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the</span>
<span class="s0">victory to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">having been captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new</span>
<span class="s0">ruler for France.</span>

<span class="s0">It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real</span>
<span class="s0">strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far</span>
<span class="s0">from the scene of action. General events involuntarily group</span>
<span class="s0">themselves around some particular incident. So now the courtiers'</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor's birthday as on the fact of the victory itself. It was</span>
<span class="s0">like a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was made in Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">report of the Russian losses, among which figured the names of</span>
<span class="s0">Tuchkov, Bagration, and Kutaysov. In the Petersburg world this sad</span>
<span class="s0">side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single</span>
<span class="s0">incident: Kutaysov's death. Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked him,</span>
<span class="s0">and he was young and interesting. That day everyone met with the</span>
<span class="s0">words:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a</span>
<span class="s0">loss Kutaysov is! How sorry I am!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What did I tell about Kutuzov?&quot; Prince Vasili now said with a</span>
<span class="s0">prophet's pride. &quot;I always said he was the only man capable of</span>
<span class="s0">defeating Napoleon.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood</span>
<span class="s0">grew anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the</span>
<span class="s0">suspense occasioned the Emperor.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fancy the Emperor's position!&quot; said they, and instead of</span>
<span class="s0">extolling Kutuzov as they had done the day before, they condemned</span>
<span class="s0">him as the cause of the Emperor's anxiety. That day Prince Vasili no</span>
<span class="s0">longer boasted of his protege Kutuzov, but remained silent when the</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if</span>
<span class="s0">everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy,</span>
<span class="s0">a terrible piece of news was added. Countess Helene Bezukhova had</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to</span>
<span class="s0">mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone said that</span>
<span class="s0">Countess Bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris,</span>
<span class="s0">but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private</span>
<span class="s0">physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a</span>
<span class="s0">certain drug to produce a certain effect; but Helene, tortured by</span>
<span class="s0">the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom</span>
<span class="s0">she had written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied,</span>
<span class="s0">had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in</span>
<span class="s0">agony before assistance could be rendered her. It was said that Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Vasili and the old count had turned upon the Italian, but the latter</span>
<span class="s0">had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they</span>
<span class="s0">had immediately let the matter drop.</span>

<span class="s0">Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">lack of news, the loss of Kutuzov, and the death of Helene.</span>

<span class="s0">On the third day after Kutuzov's report a country gentleman</span>
<span class="s0">arrived from Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French</span>
<span class="s0">spread through the whole town. This was terrible! What a position</span>
<span class="s0">for the Emperor to be in! Kutuzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasili</span>
<span class="s0">during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his</span>
<span class="s0">daughter's death said of Kutuzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was</span>
<span class="s0">excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said), that it</span>
<span class="s0">was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old</span>
<span class="s0">man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted</span>
<span class="s0">to such a man.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt</span>
<span class="s0">it, but the next day the following communication was received from</span>
<span class="s0">Count Rostopchin:</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Kutuzov's adjutant has brought me a letter in which he</span>
<span class="s0">demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road. He</span>
<span class="s0">writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will</span>
<span class="s0">shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness</span>
<span class="s0">is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall</span>
<span class="s0">follow the army. I have had everything removed, and it only remains</span>
<span class="s0">for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland.</span>


<span class="s0">On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov with the following rescript:</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Michael Ilarionovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have</span>
<span class="s0">received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I</span>
<span class="s0">received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslavl, the sad</span>
<span class="s0">news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You</span>
<span class="s0">can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your</span>
<span class="s0">silence increases my astonishment. I am sending this by</span>
<span class="s0">Adjutant-General Prince Volkonski, to hear from you the situation of</span>
<span class="s0">the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy</span>
<span class="s0">decision.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that</span>
<span class="s0">event. This messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know</span>
<span class="s0">Russian, but who was quoique etranger, russe de coeur et d'ame,* as he</span>
<span class="s0">said of himself.</span>


<span class="s0">*Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.</span>


<span class="s0">The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the</span>
<span class="s0">palace on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before</span>
<span class="s0">the campaign and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as</span>
<span class="s0">he wrote) when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain*</span>
<span class="s0">with the news of the burning of Moscow, dont les flammes eclairaient</span>
<span class="s0">sa route.*[2]</span>


<span class="s0">*Our most gracious sovereign.</span>

<span class="s0">*[2] Whose flames illumined his route.</span>


<span class="s0">Though the source of M. Michaud's chagrin must have been different</span>
<span class="s0">from that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when</span>
<span class="s0">shown into the Emperor's study that the latter at once asked:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very sad, sire,&quot; replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The abandonment of Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.</span>

<span class="s0">Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutuzov had entrusted</span>
<span class="s0">to him, which was that it had been impossible to fight before</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the</span>
<span class="s0">army as well as Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal</span>
<span class="s0">had to choose the latter.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Has the enemy entered the city?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he</span>
<span class="s0">was frightened by what he had done.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip</span>
<span class="s0">trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming</span>
<span class="s0">himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in</span>
<span class="s0">a firm voice:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence</span>
<span class="s0">requires great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in</span>
<span class="s0">all things to His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the</span>
<span class="s0">army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did</span>
<span class="s0">you not notice discouragement?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also</span>
<span class="s0">grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal</span>
<span class="s0">soldier?&quot; he asked to gain time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Colonel, I always require it,&quot; replied the Emperor. &quot;Conceal</span>
<span class="s0">nothing from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire!&quot; said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on</span>
<span class="s0">his lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, &quot;sire, I left</span>
<span class="s0">the whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without</span>
<span class="s0">exception in desperate and agonized terror...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How is that?&quot; the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. &quot;Would</span>
<span class="s0">misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had</span>
<span class="s0">prepared.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire,&quot; he said, with respectful playfulness, &quot;they are only</span>
<span class="s0">afraid lest Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should</span>
<span class="s0">allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the</span>
<span class="s0">combat,&quot; declared this representative of the Russian nation, &quot;and to</span>
<span class="s0">prove to Your Majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they</span>
<span class="s0">are....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, he patted Michaud on the shoulder. &quot;You set me at ease,</span>
<span class="s0">Colonel.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He bent his head and was silent for some time.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, go back to the army,&quot; he said, drawing himself up to</span>
<span class="s0">his full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic</span>
<span class="s0">gesture, &quot;and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you</span>
<span class="s0">go that when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the</span>
<span class="s0">head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last</span>
<span class="s0">resources of my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies</span>
<span class="s0">suppose,&quot; said the Emperor growing more and more animated; &quot;but should</span>
<span class="s0">it ever be ordained by Divine Providence,&quot; he continued, raising to</span>
<span class="s0">heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion, &quot;that my dynasty should</span>
<span class="s0">cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting</span>
<span class="s0">all the means at my command, I shall let my beard grow to here&quot; (he</span>
<span class="s0">pointed halfway down his chest) &quot;and go and eat potatoes with the</span>
<span class="s0">meanest of my peasants, rather than sign the disgrace of my country</span>
<span class="s0">and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to appreciate.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his</span>
<span class="s0">eyes, and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a</span>
<span class="s0">few moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the</span>
<span class="s0">elbow with a vigorous movement. The Emperor's mild and handsome face</span>
<span class="s0">was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we</span>
<span class="s0">may recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, touching his breast. &quot;We can no longer both reign together. I</span>
<span class="s0">have learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the Emperor paused, with a frown.</span>

<span class="s0">When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm</span>
<span class="s0">resolution in the Emperor's eyes, Michaud--quoique etranger, russe</span>
<span class="s0">de coeur et d'ame--at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by</span>
<span class="s0">all that he had heard (as he used afterwards to say), and gave</span>
<span class="s0">expression to his own feelings and those of the Russian people whose</span>
<span class="s0">representative he considered himself to be, in the following words:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sire!&quot; said he, &quot;Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory</span>
<span class="s0">of the nation and the salvation of Europe!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine</span>
<span class="s0">that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were</span>
<span class="s0">fleeing to distant provinces, and one levy after another was being</span>
<span class="s0">raised for the defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the</span>
<span class="s0">greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves,</span>
<span class="s0">saving their fatherland, or weeping over its downfall. The tales and</span>
<span class="s0">descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the</span>
<span class="s0">self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, and the heroism of</span>
<span class="s0">the Russians. But it was not really so. It appears so to us because we</span>
<span class="s0">see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all</span>
<span class="s0">the personal human interests that people had. Yet in reality those</span>
<span class="s0">personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general</span>
<span class="s0">interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt</span>
<span class="s0">or even noticed. Most of the people at that time paid no attention</span>
<span class="s0">to the general progress of events but were guided only by their</span>
<span class="s0">private interests, and they were the very people whose activities at</span>
<span class="s0">that period were most useful.</span>

<span class="s0">Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to</span>
<span class="s0">take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless</span>
<span class="s0">members of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they</span>
<span class="s0">did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish--like</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's and Mamonov's regiments which looted Russian villages, and</span>
<span class="s0">the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded,</span>
<span class="s0">and so on. Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing</span>
<span class="s0">their feelings, who discussed Russia's position at the time</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of</span>
<span class="s0">pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed</span>
<span class="s0">against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty</span>
<span class="s0">of. In historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of</span>
<span class="s0">the Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable. Only unconscious action</span>
<span class="s0">bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never</span>
<span class="s0">understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts</span>
<span class="s0">are fruitless.</span>

<span class="s0">The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place</span>
<span class="s0">in Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg</span>
<span class="s0">and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and</span>
<span class="s0">gentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital</span>
<span class="s0">and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which</span>
<span class="s0">retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be</span>
<span class="s0">avenged on the French, but they thought about their next pay, their</span>
<span class="s0">next quarters, of Matreshka the vivandiere, and like matters.</span>

<span class="s0">As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostov took a</span>
<span class="s0">close and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so</span>
<span class="s0">casually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked</span>
<span class="s0">at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally</span>
<span class="s0">racking his brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the</span>
<span class="s0">state of Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to</span>
<span class="s0">think about it, that Kutuzov and others were there for that purpose,</span>
<span class="s0">but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their</span>
<span class="s0">full strength, that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet,</span>
<span class="s0">and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of</span>
<span class="s0">a regiment in a couple of years' time.</span>

<span class="s0">As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being</span>
<span class="s0">sent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without</span>
<span class="s0">regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but</span>
<span class="s0">with the greatest pleasure--which he did not conceal and which his</span>
<span class="s0">comrades fully understood.</span>

<span class="s0">A few days before the battle of Borodino, Nicholas received the</span>
<span class="s0">necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in</span>
<span class="s0">advance, he set out with post horses for Voronezh.</span>

<span class="s0">Only a man who has experienced it--that is, has passed some months</span>
<span class="s0">continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war--can understand</span>
<span class="s0">the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by</span>
<span class="s0">the army's foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When-</span>
<span class="s0">free from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp--he saw</span>
<span class="s0">villages with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen's country</span>
<span class="s0">houses, fields where cattle were grazing, posthouses with</span>
<span class="s0">stationmasters asleep in them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this</span>
<span class="s0">for the first time. What for a long while specially surprised and</span>
<span class="s0">delighted him were the women, young and healthy, without a dozen</span>
<span class="s0">officers making up to each of them; women, too, who were pleased and</span>
<span class="s0">flattered that a passing officer should joke with them.</span>

<span class="s0">In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in</span>
<span class="s0">Voronezh, ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and</span>
<span class="s0">next day, very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not</span>
<span class="s0">worn for a long time, went to present himself to the authorities.</span>

<span class="s0">The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man</span>
<span class="s0">who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He</span>
<span class="s0">received Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically</span>
<span class="s0">military) and questioned him with an important air, as if</span>
<span class="s0">considering the general progress of affairs and approving and</span>
<span class="s0">disapproving with full right to do so. Nicholas was in such good</span>
<span class="s0">spirits that this merely amused him.</span>

<span class="s0">From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The</span>
<span class="s0">governor was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated</span>
<span class="s0">the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended</span>
<span class="s0">to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out</span>
<span class="s0">of town who had the best horses, and promised to assist him in every</span>
<span class="s0">way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are Count Ilya Rostov's son? My wife was a great friend of your</span>
<span class="s0">mother's. We are at home on Thursdays--today is Thursday, so please</span>
<span class="s0">come and see us quite informally,&quot; said the governor, taking leave</span>
<span class="s0">of him.</span>

<span class="s0">Immediately on leaving the governor's, Nicholas hired post horses</span>
<span class="s0">and, taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop</span>
<span class="s0">to the landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay</span>
<span class="s0">in Voronezh and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant</span>
<span class="s0">state of mind, everything went well and easily.</span>

<span class="s0">The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old</span>
<span class="s0">cavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some</span>
<span class="s0">century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery</span>
<span class="s0">where he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses.</span>

<span class="s0">In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six</span>
<span class="s0">thousand rubles--to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.</span>
<span class="s0">After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine,</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas--having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was</span>
<span class="s0">already on the friendliest terms--galloped back over abominable roads,</span>
<span class="s0">in the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as</span>
<span class="s0">to be in time for the governor's party.</span>

<span class="s0">When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented</span>
<span class="s0">himself, Nicholas arrived at the governor's rather late, but with</span>
<span class="s0">the phrase &quot;better late than never&quot; on his lips.</span>

<span class="s0">It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew</span>
<span class="s0">that Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the</span>
<span class="s0">clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come</span>
<span class="s0">as to a ball.</span>

<span class="s0">Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this</span>
<span class="s0">difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the</span>
<span class="s0">arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything</span>
<span class="s0">that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was</span>
<span class="s0">noticeable, an &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound--who cares?&quot; spirit,</span>
<span class="s0">and the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and</span>
<span class="s0">mutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.</span>

<span class="s0">The society gathered together at the governor's was the best in</span>
<span class="s0">Voronezh.</span>

<span class="s0">There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas' Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the</span>
<span class="s0">cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured</span>
<span class="s0">and well-bred Count Rostov. Among the men was an Italian prisoner,</span>
<span class="s0">an officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence</span>
<span class="s0">of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The</span>
<span class="s0">Italian was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he</span>
<span class="s0">treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing</span>
<span class="s0">around him a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the</span>
<span class="s0">words &quot;better late than never&quot; and heard them repeated several times</span>
<span class="s0">by others, people clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he</span>
<span class="s0">felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the</span>
<span class="s0">province--that of a universal favorite: a very pleasant position,</span>
<span class="s0">and intoxicatingly so after his long privations. At posting</span>
<span class="s0">stations, at inns, and in the landowner's snuggery, maidservants had</span>
<span class="s0">been flattered by his notice, and here too at the governor's party</span>
<span class="s0">there were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible number of</span>
<span class="s0">pretty young women, married and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his</span>
<span class="s0">notice. The women and girls flirted with him and, from the first</span>
<span class="s0">day, the people concerned themselves to get this fine young</span>
<span class="s0">daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these was the</span>
<span class="s0">governor's wife herself, who welcomed Rostov as a near relative and</span>
<span class="s0">called him &quot;Nicholas.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Catherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise, and</span>
<span class="s0">dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the</span>
<span class="s0">provincial society by his agility. His particularly free manner of</span>
<span class="s0">dancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised</span>
<span class="s0">at the way he danced that evening. He had never danced like that in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner</span>
<span class="s0">improper and in bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to</span>
<span class="s0">astonish them all by something unusual, something they would have to</span>
<span class="s0">accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the</span>
<span class="s0">provinces.</span>

<span class="s0">All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and</span>
<span class="s0">pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.</span>
<span class="s0">With the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other</span>
<span class="s0">men's wives were created for them, Rostov did not leave the lady's</span>
<span class="s0">side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style,</span>
<span class="s0">as if, without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and</span>
<span class="s0">the lady would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem</span>
<span class="s0">to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov. But</span>
<span class="s0">the latter's good-natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even</span>
<span class="s0">he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas' good humor. Toward the end of</span>
<span class="s0">the evening, however, as the wife's face grew more flushed and</span>
<span class="s0">animated, the husband's became more and more melancholy and solemn, as</span>
<span class="s0">though there were but a given amount of animation between them and</span>
<span class="s0">as the wife's share increased the husband's diminished.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending</span>
<span class="s0">closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments</span>
<span class="s0">with a smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the</span>
<span class="s0">position of his legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor</span>
<span class="s0">of perfume, and admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines</span>
<span class="s0">of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the</span>
<span class="s0">blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in</span>
<span class="s0">Voronezh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Which lady?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes&quot; (Nicholas looked at his</span>
<span class="s0">partner) &quot;are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure&quot; (he glanced</span>
<span class="s0">at her shoulders) &quot;like Diana's....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking</span>
<span class="s0">about.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Nikita Ivanych!&quot; cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if</span>
<span class="s0">wishing Nikita Ivanych to share his joke, he began to tell him of</span>
<span class="s0">his intention to elope with a blonde lady.</span>

<span class="s0">The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor's</span>
<span class="s0">good-natured wife came up with a look of disapproval.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Anna Ignatyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,&quot; said she,</span>
<span class="s0">pronouncing the name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna</span>
<span class="s0">Ignatyevna was a very important person. &quot;Come, Nicholas! You know</span>
<span class="s0">you let me call you so?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Anna Ignatyevna Malvintseva. She has heard from her niece how you</span>
<span class="s0">rescued her... Can you guess?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I rescued such a lot of them!&quot; said Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Her niece, Princess Bolkonskaya. She is here in Voronezh with her</span>
<span class="s0">aunt. Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not a bit! Please don't, Aunt!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The governor's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady</span>
<span class="s0">with a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with</span>
<span class="s0">the most important personages of the town. This was Malvintseva,</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary's aunt on her mother's side, a rich, childless widow who</span>
<span class="s0">always lived in Voronezh. When Rostov approached her she was</span>
<span class="s0">standing settling up for the game. She looked at him and, screwing</span>
<span class="s0">up her eyes sternly, continued to upbraid the general who had won from</span>
<span class="s0">her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Very pleased, mon cher,&quot; she then said, holding out her hand to</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas. &quot;Pray come and see me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom</span>
<span class="s0">Malvintseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the</span>
<span class="s0">important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation</span>
<span class="s0">to come to see her.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the</span>
<span class="s0">mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and</span>
<span class="s0">even of fear, which he himself did not understand.</span>

<span class="s0">When he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the</span>
<span class="s0">dancing, but the governor's little wife placed her plump hand on his</span>
<span class="s0">sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to</span>
<span class="s0">her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew</span>
<span class="s0">so as not to be in her way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know, dear boy,&quot; began the governor's wife with a serious</span>
<span class="s0">expression on her kind little face, &quot;that really would be the match</span>
<span class="s0">for you: would you like me to arrange it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whom do you mean, Aunt?&quot; asked Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petrovna</span>
<span class="s0">speaks of Lily, but I say, no--the princess! Do you want me to do</span>
<span class="s0">it? I am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl</span>
<span class="s0">she is, really! And she is not at all so plain, either.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. &quot;As</span>
<span class="s0">befits a soldier, Aunt, I don't force myself on anyone or refuse</span>
<span class="s0">anything,&quot; he said before he had time to consider what he was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well then, remember, this is not a joke!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course not!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; the governor's wife said as if talking to herself. &quot;But,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other,</span>
<span class="s0">the blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh no, we are good friends with him,&quot; said Nicholas in the</span>
<span class="s0">simplicity of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor's wife!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">thought Nicholas suddenly at supper. &quot;She will really begin to arrange</span>
<span class="s0">a match... and Soyna...?&quot; And on taking leave of the governor's</span>
<span class="s0">wife, when she again smilingly said to him, &quot;Well then, remember!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he drew her aside.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it, my dear? Come, let's sit down here,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or</span>
<span class="s0">his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he</span>
<span class="s0">afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable</span>
<span class="s0">frankness which had very important results for him, it seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">him--as it seems to everyone in such cases--that it was merely some</span>
<span class="s0">silly whim that seized him: yet that burst of frankness, together with</span>
<span class="s0">other trifling events, had immense consequences for him and for all</span>
<span class="s0">his family.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but</span>
<span class="s0">the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, I understand,&quot; said the governor's wife.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But Princess Bolkonskaya--that's another matter. I will tell you</span>
<span class="s0">the truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to</span>
<span class="s0">her; and then, after I met her under such circumstances--so strangely,</span>
<span class="s0">the idea often occurred to me: 'This is fate.' Especially if you</span>
<span class="s0">remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never</span>
<span class="s0">happened to meet her before, somehow it had always happened that we</span>
<span class="s0">did not meet. And as long as my sister Natasha was engaged to her</span>
<span class="s0">brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of</span>
<span class="s0">marrying her. And it must needs happen that I should meet her just</span>
<span class="s0">when Natasha's engagement had been broken off... and then</span>
<span class="s0">everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone and never</span>
<span class="s0">will, only to you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The governor's wife pressed his elbow gratefully.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know Sonya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her,</span>
<span class="s0">and will do so.... So you see there can be no question about-&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas incoherently and blushing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sonya has nothing</span>
<span class="s0">and you yourself say your Papa's affairs are in a very bad way. And</span>
<span class="s0">what about your mother? It would kill her, that's one thing. And</span>
<span class="s0">what sort of life would it be for Sonya--if she's a girl with a heart?</span>
<span class="s0">Your mother in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya ought to understand that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All the same, Aunt, it is impossible,&quot; he rejoined with a sigh,</span>
<span class="s0">after a short pause. &quot;Besides, would the princess have me? And</span>
<span class="s0">besides, she is now in mourning. How can one think of it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you don't suppose I'm going to get you married at once? There</span>
<span class="s0">is always a right way of doing things,&quot; replied the governor's wife.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a matchmaker you are, Aunt...&quot; said Nicholas, kissing her</span>
<span class="s0">plump little hand.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostov, Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">had found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvintseva at</span>
<span class="s0">Voronezh. That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her</span>
<span class="s0">during her father's illness, since his death, and especially since her</span>
<span class="s0">meeting with Rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey,</span>
<span class="s0">anxiety about her brother, settling in a new house, meeting new</span>
<span class="s0">people, and attending to her nephew's education. She was sad. Now,</span>
<span class="s0">after a month passed in quiet surroundings, she felt more and more</span>
<span class="s0">deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with</span>
<span class="s0">the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly tortured by the</span>
<span class="s0">thought of the dangers to which her brother, the only intimate</span>
<span class="s0">person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was worried too about</span>
<span class="s0">her nephew's education for which she had always felt herself</span>
<span class="s0">incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace--a</span>
<span class="s0">peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal</span>
<span class="s0">dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her</span>
<span class="s0">and were related to her meeting with Rostov.</span>

<span class="s0">The day after her party the governor's wife came to see</span>
<span class="s0">Malvintseva and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked</span>
<span class="s0">that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of</span>
<span class="s0">course, not to be thought of, all the same the young people might be</span>
<span class="s0">brought together and could get to know one another. Malvintseva</span>
<span class="s0">expressed approval, and the governor's wife began to speak of Rostov</span>
<span class="s0">in Mary's presence, praising him and telling how he had blushed when</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary's name was mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a</span>
<span class="s0">painful rather than a joyful feeling--her mental tranquillity was</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.</span>

<span class="s0">During the two days that elapsed before Rostov called, Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she</span>
<span class="s0">decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her</span>
<span class="s0">aunt--that it would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to</span>
<span class="s0">receive visitors; then she thought this would be rude after what he</span>
<span class="s0">had done for her; then it occurred to her that her aunt and the</span>
<span class="s0">governor's wife had intentions concerning herself and Rostov--their</span>
<span class="s0">looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition--then</span>
<span class="s0">she told herself that only she, with her sinful nature, could think</span>
<span class="s0">this of them: they could not forget that situated as she was, while</span>
<span class="s0">still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking would be an insult to</span>
<span class="s0">her and to her father's memory. Assuming that she did go down to see</span>
<span class="s0">him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she</span>
<span class="s0">would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold</span>
<span class="s0">and then to mean too much. More than anything she feared lest the</span>
<span class="s0">confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she</span>
<span class="s0">saw him.</span>

<span class="s0">But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing</span>
<span class="s0">room that Count Rostov had called, the princess showed no confusion,</span>
<span class="s0">only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new</span>
<span class="s0">and radiant light.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You have met him, Aunt?&quot; said she in a calm voice, unable herself</span>
<span class="s0">to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.</span>

<span class="s0">When Rostov entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an</span>
<span class="s0">instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then</span>
<span class="s0">just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look</span>
<span class="s0">with shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she</span>
<span class="s0">half rose with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate</span>
<span class="s0">hand to him, and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time</span>
<span class="s0">new deep womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise.</span>
<span class="s0">Herself a consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on</span>
<span class="s0">meeting a man she wished to attract.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has</span>
<span class="s0">greatly improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what</span>
<span class="s0">tact and grace!&quot; thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.</span>

<span class="s0">Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she</span>
<span class="s0">would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the</span>
<span class="s0">change that had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized</span>
<span class="s0">that dear, loved face, a new life force took possession of her and</span>
<span class="s0">compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will. From the</span>
<span class="s0">time Rostov entered, her face became suddenly transformed. It was as</span>
<span class="s0">if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the</span>
<span class="s0">intricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, that previously</span>
<span class="s0">seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly shown up in</span>
<span class="s0">unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time all that pure,</span>
<span class="s0">spiritual, inward travail through which she had lived appeared on</span>
<span class="s0">the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction with herself,</span>
<span class="s0">her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her meekness, love,</span>
<span class="s0">and self-sacrifice--all this now shone in those radiant eyes, in her</span>
<span class="s0">delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.</span>

<span class="s0">Rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He</span>
<span class="s0">felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better</span>
<span class="s0">than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.</span>

<span class="s0">Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of</span>
<span class="s0">the war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow</span>
<span class="s0">about it; they spoke of their last meeting--Nicholas trying to</span>
<span class="s0">change the subject--they talked of the governor's kind wife, of</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas' relations, and of Princess Mary's.</span>

<span class="s0">She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as</span>
<span class="s0">soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of</span>
<span class="s0">Russia's misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was</span>
<span class="s0">too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of</span>
<span class="s0">him. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary's character with an observation unusual to him, and everything</span>
<span class="s0">confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and</span>
<span class="s0">extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people</span>
<span class="s0">spoke to him about the princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and</span>
<span class="s0">even when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt quite at</span>
<span class="s0">ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite</span>
<span class="s0">appropriately, occurred to him at the moment.</span>

<span class="s0">When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is</span>
<span class="s0">usual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew's little son,</span>
<span class="s0">caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He</span>
<span class="s0">took the boy on his knee, played with him, and looked round at</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary. With a softened, happy, timid look she watched the</span>
<span class="s0">boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved. Nicholas also</span>
<span class="s0">noticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed with pleasure</span>
<span class="s0">and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness.</span>

<span class="s0">As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society,</span>
<span class="s0">and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but</span>
<span class="s0">all the same the governor's wife went on with her matchmaking, passing</span>
<span class="s0">on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and</span>
<span class="s0">vice versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary.</span>
<span class="s0">For this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at</span>
<span class="s0">the bishop's house before Mass.</span>

<span class="s0">Though Rostov told the governeor's wife that he would not make any</span>
<span class="s0">declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.</span>

<span class="s0">As at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what</span>
<span class="s0">everybody considered right was right, so now, after a short but</span>
<span class="s0">sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own</span>
<span class="s0">sense of justice, and in obedient submission to circumstances, he</span>
<span class="s0">chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly</span>
<span class="s0">carrying him he knew not where. He knew that after his promise to</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely. But he also</span>
<span class="s0">knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that by resigning</span>
<span class="s0">himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were</span>
<span class="s0">guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing</span>
<span class="s0">something very important--more important than anything he had ever</span>
<span class="s0">done in his life.</span>

<span class="s0">After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on</span>
<span class="s0">externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for</span>
<span class="s0">him and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her</span>
<span class="s0">as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he</span>
<span class="s0">had met in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time</span>
<span class="s0">rapturously, thought about Sonya. He had pictured each of those</span>
<span class="s0">young ladies as almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as</span>
<span class="s0">a possible wife, adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions</span>
<span class="s0">of married life: a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his</span>
<span class="s0">wife's carriage, little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to</span>
<span class="s0">her, and so on--and these pictures of the future had given him</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure. But with Princess Mary, to whom they were trying to get</span>
<span class="s0">him engaged, he could never picture anything of future married life.</span>
<span class="s0">If he tried, his pictures seemed incongruous and false. It made him</span>
<span class="s0">afraid.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">The dreadful news of the battle of Borodino, of our losses in killed</span>
<span class="s0">and wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">reached Voronezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having</span>
<span class="s0">learned of her brother's wound only from the Gazette and having no</span>
<span class="s0">definite news of him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her</span>
<span class="s0">again himself) to set off in search of Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the</span>
<span class="s0">abandonment of Moscow, Rostov was not seized with despair, anger,</span>
<span class="s0">the desire for vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but</span>
<span class="s0">everything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and</span>
<span class="s0">he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The</span>
<span class="s0">conversations he heard seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to</span>
<span class="s0">judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would</span>
<span class="s0">everything again become clear to him. He made haste to finish buying</span>
<span class="s0">the horses, and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and</span>
<span class="s0">squadron quartermaster.</span>

<span class="s0">A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">victory. He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with</span>
<span class="s0">military decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of</span>
<span class="s0">subjects. When the service was over the governor's wife beckoned him</span>
<span class="s0">to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Have you seen the princess?&quot; she asked, indicating with a</span>
<span class="s0">movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond</span>
<span class="s0">the choir.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the</span>
<span class="s0">profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude,</span>
<span class="s0">timidity, and pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently engrossed by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last</span>
<span class="s0">time before leaving the church.</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he</span>
<span class="s0">had seen before, there was the same general expression of refined,</span>
<span class="s0">inner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There</span>
<span class="s0">was a pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had</span>
<span class="s0">occurred before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her</span>
<span class="s0">without waiting to be prompted by the governor's wife and not asking</span>
<span class="s0">himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here</span>
<span class="s0">in church, and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized</span>
<span class="s0">with his whole soul. As soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow</span>
<span class="s0">kindled in her face, lighting up both her sorrow and her joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,&quot; said Rostov.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;It is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikolievich, were not</span>
<span class="s0">living, it would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he</span>
<span class="s0">is a colonel.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but</span>
<span class="s0">cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound&quot; (the Gazette</span>
<span class="s0">said it was a shell) &quot;either proving fatal at once or being very</span>
<span class="s0">slight,&quot; continued Nicholas. &quot;We must hope for the best, and I am</span>
<span class="s0">sure...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, that would be so dread...&quot; she began and, prevented by</span>
<span class="s0">agitation from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as</span>
<span class="s0">graceful as everything she did in his presence and, looking up at</span>
<span class="s0">him gratefully, went out, following her aunt.</span>

<span class="s0">That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle</span>
<span class="s0">some accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that</span>
<span class="s0">business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to</span>
<span class="s0">go to bed, and for a long time he paced up and down the room,</span>
<span class="s0">reflecting on his life, a thing he rarely did.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had</span>
<span class="s0">met her in Smolensk province. His having encountered her in such</span>
<span class="s0">exceptional circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned</span>
<span class="s0">her to him as a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her.</span>
<span class="s0">When he met her again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was</span>
<span class="s0">not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the</span>
<span class="s0">peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was,</span>
<span class="s0">however, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to</span>
<span class="s0">regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her.</span>
<span class="s0">But that day's encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than</span>
<span class="s0">was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face,</span>
<span class="s0">that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially</span>
<span class="s0">the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated</span>
<span class="s0">him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostov could not bear to see the</span>
<span class="s0">expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy</span>
<span class="s0">and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed</span>
<span class="s0">the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an</span>
<span class="s0">irresistible attraction.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!&quot; he said to himself.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya?&quot; And he</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one</span>
<span class="s0">and the abundance of it in the other--a spirituality he himself lacked</span>
<span class="s0">and therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would</span>
<span class="s0">happen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would</span>
<span class="s0">become his wife. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed,</span>
<span class="s0">and no clear picture presented itself to his mind. He had long ago</span>
<span class="s0">pictured to himself a future with Sonya, and that was all clear and</span>
<span class="s0">simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all</span>
<span class="s0">there was in Sonya, but it was impossible to picture a future with</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.</span>

<span class="s0">Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them,</span>
<span class="s0">but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little</span>
<span class="s0">frightening.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How she prayed!&quot; he thought. &quot;It was plain that her whole soul</span>
<span class="s0">was in her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains,</span>
<span class="s0">and I am sure her prayer will be answered. Why don't I pray for what I</span>
<span class="s0">want?&quot; he suddenly thought. &quot;What do I want? To be free, released from</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya... She was right,&quot; he thought, remembering what the governor's</span>
<span class="s0">wife had said: &quot;Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya.</span>
<span class="s0">Muddles, grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible</span>
<span class="s0">muddles! Besides, I don't love her--not as I should. O, God! release</span>
<span class="s0">me from this dreadful, inextricable position!&quot; he suddenly began to</span>
<span class="s0">pray. &quot;Yes, prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not</span>
<span class="s0">pray as Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn</span>
<span class="s0">into sugar--and then run out into the yard to see whether it had</span>
<span class="s0">done so. No, but I am not praying for trifles now,&quot; he thought as he</span>
<span class="s0">put his pipe down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself</span>
<span class="s0">before the icon. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to</span>
<span class="s0">pray as he had not done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in</span>
<span class="s0">his throat when the door opened and Lavrushka came in with some</span>
<span class="s0">papers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?&quot; cried</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas, quickly changing his attitude.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;From the governor,&quot; said Lavrushka in a sleepy voice. &quot;A courier</span>
<span class="s0">has arrived and there's a letter for you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, all right, thanks. You can go!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother</span>
<span class="s0">and the other from Sonya. He recognized them by the handwriting and</span>
<span class="s0">opened Sonya's first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale</span>
<span class="s0">and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, it's not possible!&quot; he cried aloud.</span>

<span class="s0">Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter</span>
<span class="s0">and reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then</span>
<span class="s0">again, and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders, stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes fixed. What he had just been praying for with confidence that</span>
<span class="s0">God would hear him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much</span>
<span class="s0">astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected, and</span>
<span class="s0">as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had</span>
<span class="s0">not come from God to whom he had prayed, but by some ordinary</span>
<span class="s0">coincidence.</span>

<span class="s0">This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary</span>
<span class="s0">letter from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from</span>
<span class="s0">which there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last</span>
<span class="s0">unfortunate events--the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs'</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow property--and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his</span>
<span class="s0">silence and coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide to</span>
<span class="s0">release him from his promise and set him completely free.</span>


<span class="s0">It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of</span>
<span class="s0">sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she</span>
<span class="s0">wrote), and my love has no aim but the happiness of those I love;</span>
<span class="s0">so, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured</span>
<span class="s0">that, in spite of everything, no one can love you more than does</span>

<span class="s0">Your Sonya</span>


<span class="s0">Both letters were written from Troitsa. The other, from the</span>
<span class="s0">countess, described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the</span>
<span class="s0">fire, and the destruction of all their property. In this letter the</span>
<span class="s0">countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded</span>
<span class="s0">traveling with them; his state was very critical, but the doctor</span>
<span class="s0">said there was now more hope. Sonya and Natasha were nursing him.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day Nicholas took his mother's letter and went to see</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what &quot;Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">nursing him&quot; might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations.</span>

<span class="s0">The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to</span>
<span class="s0">Yaroslavl, and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">Sonya's letter written from Troitsa, which had come as an answer</span>
<span class="s0">to Nicholas' prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess' mind more</span>
<span class="s0">and more. She knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle to this</span>
<span class="s0">happening, and Sonya's life in the countess' house had grown harder</span>
<span class="s0">and harder, especially after they had received a letter from</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharovo. The</span>
<span class="s0">countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions</span>
<span class="s0">to Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all</span>
<span class="s0">that was going on, she called Sonya to her and, instead of reproaching</span>
<span class="s0">and making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself</span>
<span class="s0">and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her</span>
<span class="s0">engagement with Nicholas.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs</span>
<span class="s0">that she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave</span>
<span class="s0">no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was</span>
<span class="s0">demanded of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had</span>
<span class="s0">reared and brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya's</span>
<span class="s0">habit. Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could</span>
<span class="s0">she show her worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it.</span>
<span class="s0">But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily</span>
<span class="s0">conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of</span>
<span class="s0">others, and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more</span>
<span class="s0">than anything in the world. But now they wanted her to sacrifice the</span>
<span class="s0">very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">and the whole meaning of her life. And for the first time she felt</span>
<span class="s0">bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to</span>
<span class="s0">torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous of Natasha who had</span>
<span class="s0">never experienced anything of this sort, had never needed to sacrifice</span>
<span class="s0">herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was</span>
<span class="s0">beloved by everybody. And for the first time Sonya felt that out of</span>
<span class="s0">her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning</span>
<span class="s0">to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue, or religion.</span>
<span class="s0">Under the influence of this feeling Sonya, whose life of dependence</span>
<span class="s0">had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered the</span>
<span class="s0">countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and resolved</span>
<span class="s0">to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but</span>
<span class="s0">on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.</span>

<span class="s0">The bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last days in Moscow stifled</span>
<span class="s0">the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find</span>
<span class="s0">escape from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and</span>
<span class="s0">for Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that</span>
<span class="s0">God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love</span>
<span class="s0">him. She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible</span>
<span class="s0">circumstances they would again fall in love with one another, and that</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would</span>
<span class="s0">be within the prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror</span>
<span class="s0">of what had happened during those last days and during the first</span>
<span class="s0">days of their journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in</span>
<span class="s0">her personal affairs cheered Sonya.</span>

<span class="s0">At the Troitsa monastery the Rostovs first broke their journey for a</span>
<span class="s0">whole day.</span>

<span class="s0">Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry,</span>
<span class="s0">one of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much</span>
<span class="s0">better that day and Natasha was sitting with him. In the next room sat</span>
<span class="s0">the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was</span>
<span class="s0">calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">and Natasha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices</span>
<span class="s0">through the door. That door opened and Natasha came out, looking</span>
<span class="s0">excited. Not noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was</span>
<span class="s0">drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sonya</span>
<span class="s0">and took her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, what are you about? Come here!&quot; said the countess.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha went up to the monk for his blessing, and advised her to</span>
<span class="s0">pray for aid to God and His saint.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as the prior withdrew, Natasha took her friend by the hand</span>
<span class="s0">and went with her into the unoccupied room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya, will he live?&quot; she asked. &quot;Sonya, how happy I am, and how</span>
<span class="s0">unhappy!... Sonya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he</span>
<span class="s0">lives! He cannot... because... because... of&quot; and Natasha burst into</span>
<span class="s0">tears.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes! I knew it! Thank God!&quot; murmured Sonya. &quot;He will live.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's fear and</span>
<span class="s0">grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.</span>
<span class="s0">Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natasha. &quot;If only he lives!&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two</span>
<span class="s0">friends went together to Prince Andrew's door. Natasha opened it</span>
<span class="s0">cautiously and glanced into the room, Sonya standing beside her at the</span>
<span class="s0">half-open door.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale</span>
<span class="s0">face was calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular</span>
<span class="s0">breathing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O, Natasha!&quot; Sonya suddenly almost screamed, catching her</span>
<span class="s0">companion's arm and stepping back from the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What is it?&quot; asked Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's that, that...&quot; said Sonya, with a white face and trembling</span>
<span class="s0">lips.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha softly closed the door and went with Sonya to the window,</span>
<span class="s0">not yet understanding what the latter was telling her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You remember,&quot; said Sonya with a solemn and frightened</span>
<span class="s0">expression. &quot;You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at</span>
<span class="s0">Otradnoe at Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; cried Natasha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely</span>
<span class="s0">recalling that Sonya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom</span>
<span class="s0">she had seen lying down.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You remember?&quot; Sonya went on. &quot;I saw it then and told everybody,</span>
<span class="s0">you and Dunyasha. I saw him lying on a bed,&quot; said she, making a</span>
<span class="s0">gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, &quot;and that he</span>
<span class="s0">had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that</span>
<span class="s0">his hands were folded,&quot; she concluded, convincing herself that the</span>
<span class="s0">details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the</span>
<span class="s0">mirror.</span>

<span class="s0">She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first</span>
<span class="s0">thing that came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to her now as real as any other recollection. She not only</span>
<span class="s0">remembered what she had then said--that he turned to look at her and</span>
<span class="s0">smiled and was covered with something red--but was firmly convinced</span>
<span class="s0">that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink</span>
<span class="s0">quilt and that his eyes were closed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, it really was pink!&quot; cried Natasha, who now thought she</span>
<span class="s0">too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most</span>
<span class="s0">extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what does it mean?&quot; she added meditatively.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange,&quot; replied Sonya, clutching</span>
<span class="s0">at her head.</span>

<span class="s0">A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natasha went to him,</span>
<span class="s0">but Sonya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the</span>
<span class="s0">window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.</span>


<span class="s0">They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and</span>
<span class="s0">the countess was writing to her son.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sonya!&quot; said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as</span>
<span class="s0">her niece passed, &quot;Sonya, won't you write to Nicholas?&quot; She spoke in a</span>
<span class="s0">soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her</span>
<span class="s0">spectacles Sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these</span>
<span class="s0">words. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear</span>
<span class="s0">of a refusal, and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such</span>
<span class="s0">refusal.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Mamma, I will write,&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">Sonya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred</span>
<span class="s0">that day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen</span>
<span class="s0">of her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha's</span>
<span class="s0">relations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a return of that</span>
<span class="s0">self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and</span>
<span class="s0">loved to live. So with a joyful consciousness of performing a</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimous deed--interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed</span>
<span class="s0">her velvety black eyes--she wrote that touching letter the arrival</span>
<span class="s0">of which had so amazed Nicholas.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with</span>
<span class="s0">hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was</span>
<span class="s0">taken. In their attitude toward him could still be felt both</span>
<span class="s0">uncertainty as to who he might be--perhaps a very important person-</span>
<span class="s0">and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him.</span>

<span class="s0">But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for</span>
<span class="s0">the new guard--both officers and men--he was not as interesting as</span>
<span class="s0">he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day</span>
<span class="s0">did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the</span>
<span class="s0">vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and</span>
<span class="s0">the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child;</span>
<span class="s0">they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and</span>
<span class="s0">detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they</span>
<span class="s0">noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed,</span>
<span class="s0">meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke</span>
<span class="s0">French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he</span>
<span class="s0">was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the</span>
<span class="s0">separate room he had occupied was required by an officer.</span>

<span class="s0">All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class</span>
<span class="s0">and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more</span>
<span class="s0">especially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them</span>
<span class="s0">making fun of him.</span>

<span class="s0">That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably,</span>
<span class="s0">among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was</span>
<span class="s0">taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white</span>
<span class="s0">mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on</span>
<span class="s0">their arms. With the precision and definiteness customary in</span>
<span class="s0">addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude human frailty,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was, where he had</span>
<span class="s0">been, with what object, and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the</span>
<span class="s0">essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that</span>
<span class="s0">essence's being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel</span>
<span class="s0">through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow</span>
<span class="s0">so as to lead to the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim, the</span>
<span class="s0">channel was removed and the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt,</span>
<span class="s0">moreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, perplexity as</span>
<span class="s0">to why these questions were put to him. He had a feeling that it was</span>
<span class="s0">only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of</span>
<span class="s0">placing a channel was employed. He knew he was in these men's power,</span>
<span class="s0">that only by force had they brought him there, that force alone gave</span>
<span class="s0">them the right to demand answers to their questions, and that the sole</span>
<span class="s0">object of that assembly was to inculpate him. And so, as they had</span>
<span class="s0">the power and wish to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry</span>
<span class="s0">and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would</span>
<span class="s0">lead to conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was arrested,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to</span>
<span class="s0">its parents a child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought</span>
<span class="s0">the marauder? Pierre answered that he &quot;was protecting a woman,&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">that &quot;to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of</span>
<span class="s0">every man; that...&quot; They interrupted him, for this was not to the</span>
<span class="s0">point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had</span>
<span class="s0">seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked where he was</span>
<span class="s0">going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they asked,</span>
<span class="s0">repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer. Again</span>
<span class="s0">he replied that he could not answer it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Put that down, that's bad... very bad,&quot; sternly remarked the</span>
<span class="s0">general with the white mustache and red flushed face.</span>


<span class="s0">On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski rampart.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a</span>
<span class="s0">merchant's house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the</span>
<span class="s0">streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the</span>
<span class="s0">whole city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize</span>
<span class="s0">the significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires</span>
<span class="s0">with horror.</span>

<span class="s0">He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and</span>
<span class="s0">during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that</span>
<span class="s0">all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any</span>
<span class="s0">day from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn</span>
<span class="s0">from the soldiers. Evidently for them &quot;the marshal&quot; represented a very</span>
<span class="s0">high and rather mysterious power.</span>

<span class="s0">These first days, before the eighth of September when the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners were had up for a second examination, were the hardest of</span>
<span class="s0">all for Pierre.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">On the eighth of September an officer--a very important one</span>
<span class="s0">judging by the respect the guards showed him--entered the coach</span>
<span class="s0">house where the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on</span>
<span class="s0">the staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the</span>
<span class="s0">Russians there, naming Pierre as &quot;the man who does not give his name.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered</span>
<span class="s0">the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up</span>
<span class="s0">before taking them to the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin's Field.</span>
<span class="s0">It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure.</span>
<span class="s0">The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken</span>
<span class="s0">from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the pure</span>
<span class="s0">air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose on</span>
<span class="s0">all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast</span>
<span class="s0">charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves</span>
<span class="s0">and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the blackened</span>
<span class="s0">walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not</span>
<span class="s0">recognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see</span>
<span class="s0">churches that had not been burned. The Kremlin, which was not</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the</span>
<span class="s0">belfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin</span>
<span class="s0">glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.</span>
<span class="s0">These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the</span>
<span class="s0">Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate</span>
<span class="s0">this holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to</span>
<span class="s0">be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when</span>
<span class="s0">they saw the French.</span>

<span class="s0">It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but</span>
<span class="s0">in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order</span>
<span class="s0">had been established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the</span>
<span class="s0">looks of the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and</span>
<span class="s0">gaily, were escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the</span>
<span class="s0">looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by</span>
<span class="s0">a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of</span>
<span class="s0">regimental music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt</span>
<span class="s0">and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French</span>
<span class="s0">officer had read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been</span>
<span class="s0">taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to</span>
<span class="s0">another place with dozens of other men, and it seemed that they</span>
<span class="s0">might have forgotten him, or confused him with the others. But no: the</span>
<span class="s0">answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his</span>
<span class="s0">designation as &quot;the man who does not give his name,&quot; and under that</span>
<span class="s0">appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were now leading</span>
<span class="s0">him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and</span>
<span class="s0">all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that</span>
<span class="s0">they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be</span>
<span class="s0">an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose</span>
<span class="s0">action he did not understand but which was working well.</span>

<span class="s0">He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the</span>
<span class="s0">Virgin's Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not</span>
<span class="s0">far from the convent. This was Prince Shcherbitov's house, where</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned from the</span>
<span class="s0">talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of</span>
<span class="s0">Eckmuhl (Davout).</span>

<span class="s0">They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass</span>
<span class="s0">gallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a</span>
<span class="s0">long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant.</span>

<span class="s0">Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end</span>
<span class="s0">of the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">consulting a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without</span>
<span class="s0">raising his eyes, he said in a low voice:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To</span>
<span class="s0">him Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for</span>
<span class="s0">his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern</span>
<span class="s0">schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did</span>
<span class="s0">not know what to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at</span>
<span class="s0">his first examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was</span>
<span class="s0">dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had</span>
<span class="s0">decided what to do, Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back</span>
<span class="s0">on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know that man,&quot; he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">calculated to frighten Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">The chill that had been running down Pierre's back now seized his</span>
<span class="s0">head as in a vise.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is a Russian spy,&quot; Davout interrupted, addressing another</span>
<span class="s0">general who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.</span>

<span class="s0">Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre rapidly began:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, monseigneur,&quot; he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a</span>
<span class="s0">duke. &quot;No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia</span>
<span class="s0">officer and have not quitted Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your name?&quot; asked Davout.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bezukhov.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What proof have I that you are not lying?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Monseigneur!&quot; exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a</span>
<span class="s0">pleading voice.</span>

<span class="s0">Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they</span>
<span class="s0">looked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from</span>
<span class="s0">conditions of war and law, that look established human relations</span>
<span class="s0">between the two men. At that moment an immense number of things passed</span>
<span class="s0">dimly through both their minds, and they realized that they were</span>
<span class="s0">both children of humanity and were brothers.</span>

<span class="s0">At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the</span>
<span class="s0">papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without</span>
<span class="s0">burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a</span>
<span class="s0">human being. He reflected for a moment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can you show me that you are telling the truth?&quot; said Davout</span>
<span class="s0">coldly.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the</span>
<span class="s0">street where the house was.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are not what you say,&quot; returned Davout.</span>

<span class="s0">In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of</span>
<span class="s0">the truth of his statements.</span>

<span class="s0">But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to</span>
<span class="s0">Davout.</span>

<span class="s0">Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began</span>
<span class="s0">buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head</span>
<span class="s0">in Pierre's direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But</span>
<span class="s0">where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach</span>
<span class="s0">house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to</span>
<span class="s0">him as they crossed the Virgin's Field.</span>

<span class="s0">He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another</span>
<span class="s0">question to Davout.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, of course!&quot; replied Davout, but what this &quot;yes&quot; meant,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre did not know.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was</span>
<span class="s0">far, or in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was</span>
<span class="s0">stupefied, and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs</span>
<span class="s0">as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only</span>
<span class="s0">thought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had really</span>
<span class="s0">sentenced him to death? Not the men on the commission that had first</span>
<span class="s0">examined him--not one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done</span>
<span class="s0">it. It was not Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In</span>
<span class="s0">another moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong, but</span>
<span class="s0">just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. The</span>
<span class="s0">adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might</span>
<span class="s0">have refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing</span>
<span class="s0">him, depriving him of life--him, Pierre, with all his memories,</span>
<span class="s0">aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">felt that it was no one.</span>

<span class="s0">It was a system--a concurrence of circumstances.</span>

<span class="s0">A system of some sort was killing him--Pierre--depriving him of</span>
<span class="s0">life, of everything, annihilating him.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">From Prince Shcherbatov's house the prisoners were led straight down</span>
<span class="s0">the Virgin's Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen</span>
<span class="s0">garden in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit</span>
<span class="s0">had been dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large</span>
<span class="s0">crowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and</span>
<span class="s0">many of Napoleon's soldiers who were not on duty--Germans, Italians,</span>
<span class="s0">and Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of</span>
<span class="s0">the post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red</span>
<span class="s0">epaulets and high boots and shakos.</span>

<span class="s0">The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the</span>
<span class="s0">list (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">felt as if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of</span>
<span class="s0">thinking or understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only</span>
<span class="s0">one wish--that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen</span>
<span class="s0">quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized</span>
<span class="s0">them.</span>

<span class="s0">The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and</span>
<span class="s0">thin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The</span>
<span class="s0">third was a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled</span>
<span class="s0">hair and a plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a</span>
<span class="s0">very handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes.</span>
<span class="s0">The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen</span>
<span class="s0">in a loose coat.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them</span>
<span class="s0">separately or two at a time. &quot;In couples,&quot; replied the officer in</span>
<span class="s0">command in a calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">and it was evident that they were all hurrying--not as men hurry to do</span>
<span class="s0">something they understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary</span>
<span class="s0">but unpleasant and incomprehensible task.</span>

<span class="s0">A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.</span>

<span class="s0">Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the</span>
<span class="s0">officer's command took the two convicts who stood first in the row.</span>
<span class="s0">The convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks</span>
<span class="s0">were being brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at</span>
<span class="s0">an approaching huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other</span>
<span class="s0">scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile.</span>
<span class="s0">With hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks</span>
<span class="s0">over their heads, and bound them to the post.</span>

<span class="s0">Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a</span>
<span class="s0">firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned</span>
<span class="s0">away to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling,</span>
<span class="s0">rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most</span>
<span class="s0">terrific thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchmen were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and</span>
<span class="s0">trembling hands. Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and</span>
<span class="s0">with similar looks, these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with</span>
<span class="s0">only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes, evidently unable to</span>
<span class="s0">understand or believe what was going to happen to them. They could not</span>
<span class="s0">believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them,</span>
<span class="s0">and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken</span>
<span class="s0">from them.</span>

<span class="s0">Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again</span>
<span class="s0">the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the</span>
<span class="s0">same moment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchmen who were again doing something by the post, their</span>
<span class="s0">trembling hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily,</span>
<span class="s0">looked around as if asking what it meant. The same question was</span>
<span class="s0">expressed in all the looks that met his.</span>

<span class="s0">On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and</span>
<span class="s0">officers without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and</span>
<span class="s0">conflict that were in his own heart. &quot;But who, after all, is doing</span>
<span class="s0">this? They are all suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?&quot; flashed</span>
<span class="s0">for an instant through his mind.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!&quot; shouted someone. The fifth</span>
<span class="s0">prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away--alone. Pierre did</span>
<span class="s0">not understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been</span>
<span class="s0">brought there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror,</span>
<span class="s0">and no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place.</span>
<span class="s0">The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment</span>
<span class="s0">they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook himself free.) The lad was</span>
<span class="s0">unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding him up under the arms,</span>
<span class="s0">and he screamed. When they got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly understood something. Whether he understood that screaming</span>
<span class="s0">was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill</span>
<span class="s0">him, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be</span>
<span class="s0">blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around</span>
<span class="s0">him with glittering eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His</span>
<span class="s0">curiosity and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the</span>
<span class="s0">highest pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man</span>
<span class="s0">seemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare</span>
<span class="s0">foot with the other.</span>

<span class="s0">When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot</span>
<span class="s0">which hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against</span>
<span class="s0">the bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in</span>
<span class="s0">that position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned</span>
<span class="s0">back again more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and</span>
<span class="s0">did not miss his slightest movement.</span>

<span class="s0">Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports</span>
<span class="s0">of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards</span>
<span class="s0">remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw</span>
<span class="s0">how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how</span>
<span class="s0">blood showed itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the</span>
<span class="s0">weight of the hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head</span>
<span class="s0">hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the</span>
<span class="s0">post. No one hindered him. Pale, frightened people were doing</span>
<span class="s0">something around the workman. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a</span>
<span class="s0">thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The body collapsed.</span>
<span class="s0">The soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it</span>
<span class="s0">into the pit.</span>

<span class="s0">They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who</span>
<span class="s0">must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying</span>
<span class="s0">with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the</span>
<span class="s0">other. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively,</span>
<span class="s0">but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole</span>
<span class="s0">body. One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and</span>
<span class="s0">angrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand him and</span>
<span class="s0">remained near the post, and no one drove him away.</span>

<span class="s0">When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was</span>
<span class="s0">taken back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the</span>
<span class="s0">post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the</span>
<span class="s0">center of the circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed</span>
<span class="s0">by.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in</span>
<span class="s0">couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies.</span>
<span class="s0">This one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed</span>
<span class="s0">back, and his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit</span>
<span class="s0">at the spot from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man,</span>
<span class="s0">taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling. An</span>
<span class="s0">old, noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by</span>
<span class="s0">the elbow dragged him to his company. The crowd of Russians and</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away silently and with</span>
<span class="s0">drooping heads.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That will teach them to start fires,&quot; said one of the Frenchmen.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier</span>
<span class="s0">who was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was</span>
<span class="s0">not able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he</span>
<span class="s0">made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.</span>

<span class="s0">Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the</span>
<span class="s0">barracks for the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said</span>
<span class="s0">to him, Pierre got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the</span>
<span class="s0">upper end of the field, where there were some sheds built of charred</span>
<span class="s0">planks, beams, and battens, and led him into one of them. In the</span>
<span class="s0">darkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at</span>
<span class="s0">them without understanding who they were, why they were there, or what</span>
<span class="s0">they wanted of him. He heard what they said, but did not understand</span>
<span class="s0">the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or</span>
<span class="s0">application of them. He replied to questions they put to him, but</span>
<span class="s0">did not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they</span>
<span class="s0">would understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but</span>
<span class="s0">they all seemed to him equally meaningless.</span>

<span class="s0">From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders</span>
<span class="s0">committed by men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the</span>
<span class="s0">mainspring of his life, on which everything depended and which made</span>
<span class="s0">everything appear alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything</span>
<span class="s0">had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not</span>
<span class="s0">acknowledge it to himself, his faith in the right ordering of the</span>
<span class="s0">universe, in humanity, in his own soul, and in God, had been</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never so strongly as</span>
<span class="s0">now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had been the</span>
<span class="s0">result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he had</span>
<span class="s0">felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be</span>
<span class="s0">found within himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled</span>
<span class="s0">before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by</span>
<span class="s0">any fault of his own. He felt that it was not in his power to regain</span>
<span class="s0">faith in the meaning of life.</span>

<span class="s0">Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something</span>
<span class="s0">about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and</span>
<span class="s0">asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he</span>
<span class="s0">found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing</span>
<span class="s0">and talking on all sides.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, then, mates... that very prince who...&quot; some voice at the</span>
<span class="s0">other end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word</span>
<span class="s0">who.</span>

<span class="s0">Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon</span>
<span class="s0">as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory</span>
<span class="s0">lad--especially dreadful because of its simplicity--and the faces of</span>
<span class="s0">the murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he</span>
<span class="s0">opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose</span>
<span class="s0">presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration</span>
<span class="s0">which came from him every time he moved. This man was doing</span>
<span class="s0">something to his legs in the darkness, and though Pierre could not see</span>
<span class="s0">his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him. On growing</span>
<span class="s0">used to the darkness Pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg</span>
<span class="s0">bands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre's interest.</span>

<span class="s0">Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he</span>
<span class="s0">carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg,</span>
<span class="s0">glancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the</span>
<span class="s0">other was already unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way,</span>
<span class="s0">having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his</span>
<span class="s0">arm following one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg</span>
<span class="s0">bands up on some pegs fixed above his head. Then he took out a</span>
<span class="s0">knife, cut something, closed the knife, placed it under the head of</span>
<span class="s0">his bed, and, seating himself comfortably, clasped his arms round</span>
<span class="s0">his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was</span>
<span class="s0">conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well rounded in these</span>
<span class="s0">deft movements, in the man's well-ordered arrangements in his</span>
<span class="s0">corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without</span>
<span class="s0">taking his eyes from him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?&quot; the little man suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">said.</span>

<span class="s0">And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong</span>
<span class="s0">voice that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt</span>
<span class="s0">tears rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time</span>
<span class="s0">to betray his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant</span>
<span class="s0">tones:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, lad, don't fret!&quot; said he, in the tender singsong caressing</span>
<span class="s0">voice old Russian peasant women employ. &quot;Don't fret, friend--'suffer</span>
<span class="s0">an hour, live for an age!' that's how it is, my dear fellow. And</span>
<span class="s0">here we live, thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too,</span>
<span class="s0">there are good men as well as bad,&quot; said he, and still speaking, he</span>
<span class="s0">turned on his knees with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and</span>
<span class="s0">went off to another part of the shed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, you rascal!&quot; Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the</span>
<span class="s0">other end of the shed. &quot;So you've come, you rascal? She remembers...</span>
<span class="s0">Now, now, that'll do!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at</span>
<span class="s0">him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something</span>
<span class="s0">wrapped in a rag.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here, eat a bit, sir,&quot; said he, resuming his former respectful tone</span>
<span class="s0">as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. &quot;We had soup</span>
<span class="s0">for dinner and the potatoes are grand!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed</span>
<span class="s0">extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, are they all right?&quot; said the soldier with a smile. &quot;You</span>
<span class="s0">should do like this.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into</span>
<span class="s0">two equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it</span>
<span class="s0">from the rag, and handed it to Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The potatoes are grand!&quot; he said once more. &quot;Eat some like that!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I'm all right,&quot; said he, &quot;but why did they shoot those poor</span>
<span class="s0">fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tss, tt...!&quot; said the little man. &quot;Ah, what a sin... what a sin!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his</span>
<span class="s0">mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: &quot;How was it, sir, that</span>
<span class="s0">you stayed in Moscow?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I didn't think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">replied Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and</span>
<span class="s0">tried me as an incendiary.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where there's law there's injustice,&quot; put in the little man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And have you been here long?&quot; Pierre asked as he munched the last</span>
<span class="s0">of the potato.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, are you a soldier then?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment. I was dying of</span>
<span class="s0">fever. We weren't told anything. There were some twenty of us lying</span>
<span class="s0">there. We had no idea, never guessed at all.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And do you feel sad here?&quot; Pierre inquired.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the surname is</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev,&quot; he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to</span>
<span class="s0">address him. &quot;They call me 'little falcon' in the regiment. How is one</span>
<span class="s0">to help feeling sad? Moscow--she's the mother of cities. How can one</span>
<span class="s0">see all this and not feel sad? But 'the maggot gnaws the cabbage,</span>
<span class="s0">yet dies first'; that's what the old folks used to tell us,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">added rapidly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What did you say?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who? I?&quot; said Karataev. &quot;I say things happen not as we plan but</span>
<span class="s0">as God judges,&quot; he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had</span>
<span class="s0">said before, and immediately continued:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you</span>
<span class="s0">have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are</span>
<span class="s0">they still living?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a</span>
<span class="s0">suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as he put</span>
<span class="s0">these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents,</span>
<span class="s0">especially that he had no mother.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there's none</span>
<span class="s0">as dear as one's own mother!&quot; said he. &quot;Well, and have you little</span>
<span class="s0">ones?&quot; he went on asking.</span>

<span class="s0">Again Pierre's negative answer seemed to distress him, and he</span>
<span class="s0">hastened to add:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Never mind! You're young folks yet, and please God may still have</span>
<span class="s0">some. The great thing is to live in harmony....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it's all the same now,&quot; Pierre could not help saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, my dear fellow!&quot; rejoined Karataev, &quot;never decline a prison</span>
<span class="s0">or a beggar's sack!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently</span>
<span class="s0">preparing to tell a long story.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,&quot; he began. &quot;We</span>
<span class="s0">had a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and</span>
<span class="s0">our house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing</span>
<span class="s0">there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so</span>
<span class="s0">happened...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into</span>
<span class="s0">someone's copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper,</span>
<span class="s0">had been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, lad,&quot; and a smile changed the tone of his voice &quot;we thought</span>
<span class="s0">it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been</span>
<span class="s0">for my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my</span>
<span class="s0">younger brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a</span>
<span class="s0">wife behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a</span>
<span class="s0">soldier. I come home on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and</span>
<span class="s0">see that they are living better than before. The yard full of</span>
<span class="s0">cattle, the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only</span>
<span class="s0">Michael the youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my children are</span>
<span class="s0">the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if</span>
<span class="s0">Platon hadn't been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to</span>
<span class="s0">go.' called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front</span>
<span class="s0">of the icons. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and bow down to his feet;</span>
<span class="s0">and you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also</span>
<span class="s0">bow down before him! Do you understand?' he says. That's how it is,</span>
<span class="s0">dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always judging, 'that's</span>
<span class="s0">not well--that's not right!' Our luck is like water in a dragnet:</span>
<span class="s0">you pull at it and it bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's empty!</span>
<span class="s0">That's how it is.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Platon shifted his seat on the straw.</span>

<span class="s0">After a short silence he rose.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I think you must be sleepy,&quot; said he, and began rapidly</span>
<span class="s0">crossing himself and repeating:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus</span>
<span class="s0">Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="s0">have mercy on us and save us!&quot; he concluded, then bowed to the ground,</span>
<span class="s0">got up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. &quot;That's the</span>
<span class="s0">way. Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What prayer was that you were saying?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh?&quot; murmured Platon, who had almost fallen asleep. &quot;What was I</span>
<span class="s0">saying? I was praying. Don't you pray?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;But what was that you said: Frola and</span>
<span class="s0">Lavra?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, of course,&quot; replied Platon quickly, &quot;the horses' saints.</span>
<span class="s0">One must pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you've curled up</span>
<span class="s0">and got warm, you daughter of a bitch!&quot; said Karataev, touching the</span>
<span class="s0">dog that lay at his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep</span>
<span class="s0">immediately.</span>

<span class="s0">Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance</span>
<span class="s0">outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but</span>
<span class="s0">inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep,</span>
<span class="s0">but lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular</span>
<span class="s0">snoring of Platon who lay beside him, and he felt that the world</span>
<span class="s0">that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a</span>
<span class="s0">new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were</span>
<span class="s0">confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he</span>
<span class="s0">remained for four weeks.</span>

<span class="s0">When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures</span>
<span class="s0">to him except Platon Karataev, who always remained in his mind a</span>
<span class="s0">most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything</span>
<span class="s0">Russian, kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next</span>
<span class="s0">morning at dawn the first impression of him, as of something round,</span>
<span class="s0">was fully confirmed: Platon's whole figure--in a French overcoat</span>
<span class="s0">girdled with a cord, a soldier's cap, and bast shoes--was round. His</span>
<span class="s0">head was quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms,</span>
<span class="s0">which he held as if ever ready to embrace something, were rounded, his</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were also round.</span>

<span class="s0">Platon Karataev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of</span>
<span class="s0">campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not</span>
<span class="s0">himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his</span>
<span class="s0">brilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken</span>
<span class="s0">semicircles when he laughed--as he often did--were all sound and good,</span>
<span class="s0">there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole</span>
<span class="s0">body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and</span>
<span class="s0">endurance.</span>

<span class="s0">His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of</span>
<span class="s0">innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief</span>
<span class="s0">peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It</span>
<span class="s0">was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going</span>
<span class="s0">to say, and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation</span>
<span class="s0">had an irresistible persuasiveness.</span>

<span class="s0">His physical strength and agility during the first days of his</span>
<span class="s0">imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and</span>
<span class="s0">sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: &quot;Lord, lay</span>
<span class="s0">me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!&quot; and every morning on</span>
<span class="s0">getting up, he said: &quot;I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake</span>
<span class="s0">myself.&quot; And indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a</span>
<span class="s0">stone, and he only had to shake himself, to be ready without a</span>
<span class="s0">moment's delay for some work, just as children are ready to play</span>
<span class="s0">directly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not</span>
<span class="s0">badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was</span>
<span class="s0">always busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation--of</span>
<span class="s0">which he was fond--and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer</span>
<span class="s0">who knows he is listened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent</span>
<span class="s0">to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks</span>
<span class="s0">about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were always</span>
<span class="s0">high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his face at</span>
<span class="s0">such times was very serious.</span>

<span class="s0">Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him-</span>
<span class="s0">everything military and alien to himself--and had returned to his</span>
<span class="s0">former peasant habits.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A soldier on leave--a shirt outside breeches,&quot; he would say.</span>

<span class="s0">He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did</span>
<span class="s0">not complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once</span>
<span class="s0">during the whole of his army service. When he related anything it</span>
<span class="s0">was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Christian&quot; life, as he called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of</span>
<span class="s0">which his talk was full, were for the most part not the coarse and</span>
<span class="s0">indecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings which taken</span>
<span class="s0">without a context seem so insignificant, but when used appositely</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom.</span>

<span class="s0">He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a</span>
<span class="s0">previous occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he</span>
<span class="s0">talked well, adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with</span>
<span class="s0">folk sayings which Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief</span>
<span class="s0">charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events--sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">just such as Pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them-</span>
<span class="s0">assumed in Karataev's a character of solemn fitness. He liked to</span>
<span class="s0">hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening</span>
<span class="s0">(they were always the same), but most of all he liked to hear</span>
<span class="s0">stories of real life. He would smile joyfully when listening to such</span>
<span class="s0">stories, now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make</span>
<span class="s0">the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself. Karataev had no</span>
<span class="s0">attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre understood them, but</span>
<span class="s0">loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in</span>
<span class="s0">contact with, particularly with man--not any particular man, but those</span>
<span class="s0">with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the</span>
<span class="s0">French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite</span>
<span class="s0">of Karataev's affectionate tenderness for him (by which he</span>
<span class="s0">unconsciously gave Pierre's spiritual life its due) he would not</span>
<span class="s0">have grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to</span>
<span class="s0">feel in the same way toward Karataev.</span>

<span class="s0">To all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a most ordinary</span>
<span class="s0">soldier. They called him &quot;little falcon&quot; or &quot;Platosha,&quot; chaffed him</span>
<span class="s0">good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always</span>
<span class="s0">remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable,</span>
<span class="s0">rounded, eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and</span>
<span class="s0">truth.</span>

<span class="s0">Platon Karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he</span>
<span class="s0">began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask</span>
<span class="s0">him to repeat them, but Platon could never recall what he had said a</span>
<span class="s0">moment before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of</span>
<span class="s0">his favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred</span>
<span class="s0">in it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of</span>
<span class="s0">it. He did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart</span>
<span class="s0">from their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation</span>
<span class="s0">of an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he</span>
<span class="s0">regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only</span>
<span class="s0">as part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and</span>
<span class="s0">actions flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as</span>
<span class="s0">fragrance exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value</span>
<span class="s0">or significance of any word or deed taken separately.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs at Yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her</span>
<span class="s0">aunt's efforts to dissuade her--and not merely to go herself but to</span>
<span class="s0">take her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy,</span>
<span class="s0">possible or impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it</span>
<span class="s0">was her duty not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps</span>
<span class="s0">dying, but to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so</span>
<span class="s0">she prepared to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">himself, Princess Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to</span>
<span class="s0">his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her</span>
<span class="s0">and his son.</span>

<span class="s0">In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were</span>
<span class="s0">the huge family coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, a</span>
<span class="s0">semiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle</span>
<span class="s0">Bourienne, little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three</span>
<span class="s0">maids, Tikhon, and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to</span>
<span class="s0">accompany her.</span>

<span class="s0">The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the</span>
<span class="s0">roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk,</span>
<span class="s0">Ryazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long and, as post horses were not</span>
<span class="s0">everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan where the</span>
<span class="s0">French were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.</span>

<span class="s0">During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary's servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of</span>
<span class="s0">spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and</span>
<span class="s0">no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy,</span>
<span class="s0">which infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslavl by</span>
<span class="s0">the end of the second week.</span>

<span class="s0">The last days of her stay in Voronezh had been the happiest of her</span>
<span class="s0">life. Her love for Rostov no longer tormented or agitated her. It</span>
<span class="s0">filled her whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she</span>
<span class="s0">no longer struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that</span>
<span class="s0">she loved and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to</span>
<span class="s0">herself in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview</span>
<span class="s0">with Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was</span>
<span class="s0">with the Rostovs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the</span>
<span class="s0">fact that Prince Andrew's relations with Natasha might, if he</span>
<span class="s0">recovered, be renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he</span>
<span class="s0">knew and thought of this.</span>

<span class="s0">Yet in spite of that, his relation to her--considerate, delicate,</span>
<span class="s0">and loving--not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between</span>
<span class="s0">them allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew</span>
<span class="s0">that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that</span>
<span class="s0">she was beloved, and was happy in regard to it.</span>

<span class="s0">But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not</span>
<span class="s0">prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the</span>
<span class="s0">contrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the</span>
<span class="s0">more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her</span>
<span class="s0">brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving</span>
<span class="s0">Voronezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn,</span>
<span class="s0">despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But</span>
<span class="s0">the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she</span>
<span class="s0">took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and</span>
<span class="s0">gave her strength.</span>

<span class="s0">As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of</span>
<span class="s0">the journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached</span>
<span class="s0">Yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there--not after many</span>
<span class="s0">days, but that very evening--again presented itself to her and her</span>
<span class="s0">agitation increased to its utmost limit.</span>

<span class="s0">The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the</span>
<span class="s0">Rostovs were staying in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was</span>
<span class="s0">appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess' face that looked</span>
<span class="s0">out at him from the window.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostovs are</span>
<span class="s0">staying at the merchant Bronnikov's house, in the Square not far</span>
<span class="s0">from here, right above the Volga,&quot; said the courier.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not</span>
<span class="s0">understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know:</span>
<span class="s0">how was her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How is the prince?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;His excellency is staying in the same house with them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then he is alive,&quot; thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;How is he?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The servants say he is still the same.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">What &quot;still the same&quot; might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with</span>
<span class="s0">an unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting</span>
<span class="s0">in front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her</span>
<span class="s0">head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling,</span>
<span class="s0">shaking and swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as</span>
<span class="s0">they were let down.</span>

<span class="s0">The carriage door was opened. On the left there was water--a great</span>
<span class="s0">river--and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:</span>
<span class="s0">servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as</span>
<span class="s0">it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This</span>
<span class="s0">was Sonya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. &quot;This way, this way!&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">the girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found</span>
<span class="s0">herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came</span>
<span class="s0">rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She</span>
<span class="s0">embraced Princess Mary and kissed her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mon enfant!&quot; she muttered, &quot;je vous aime et vous connais depuis</span>
<span class="s0">longtemps.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;My child! I love you and have known you a long time.&quot;</span>

 <span class="s0">Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the</span>
<span class="s0">countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly</span>
<span class="s0">knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in</span>
<span class="s0">French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and</span>
<span class="s0">asked: &quot;How is he?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The doctor says that he is not in danger,&quot; said the countess, but</span>
<span class="s0">as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed</span>
<span class="s0">a contradiction of her words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is he? Can I see him--can I?&quot; asked the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">the countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with</span>
<span class="s0">Dessalles. &quot;There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh,</span>
<span class="s0">what a lovely boy!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sonya</span>
<span class="s0">was talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the</span>
<span class="s0">boy, and the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had</span>
<span class="s0">changed very much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had</span>
<span class="s0">been a brisk, cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful,</span>
<span class="s0">bewildered person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually</span>
<span class="s0">looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right</span>
<span class="s0">thing. After the destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out</span>
<span class="s0">of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own</span>
<span class="s0">significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in</span>
<span class="s0">life.</span>

<span class="s0">In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible,</span>
<span class="s0">and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him</span>
<span class="s0">they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her</span>
<span class="s0">nephew, the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt</span>
<span class="s0">the necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things</span>
<span class="s0">which she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it</span>
<span class="s0">was hard for her she was not vexed with these people.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;This is my niece,&quot; said the count, introducing Sonya--&quot;You don't</span>
<span class="s0">know her, Princess?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary turned to Sonya and, trying to stifle the hostile</span>
<span class="s0">feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she</span>
<span class="s0">felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so</span>
<span class="s0">far from what was in her own heart.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is he?&quot; she asked again, addressing them all.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is downstairs. Natasha is with him,&quot; answered Sonya, flushing.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;We have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary's eyes. She</span>
<span class="s0">turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to</span>
<span class="s0">him, when light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard</span>
<span class="s0">at the door. The princess looked round and saw Natasha coming in,</span>
<span class="s0">almost running--that Natasha whom she had liked so little at their</span>
<span class="s0">meeting in Moscow long since.</span>

<span class="s0">But hardly had the princess looked at Natasha's face before she</span>
<span class="s0">realized that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a</span>
<span class="s0">friend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her</span>
<span class="s0">shoulder.</span>

<span class="s0">As soon as Natasha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew's bed,</span>
<span class="s0">heard of Princess Mary's arrival, she softly left his room and</span>
<span class="s0">hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into</span>
<span class="s0">the drawing room--that of love--boundless love for him, for her, and</span>
<span class="s0">for all that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for</span>
<span class="s0">others, and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping</span>
<span class="s0">them. It was plain that at that moment there was in Natasha's heart no</span>
<span class="s0">thought of herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at</span>
<span class="s0">the first glance at Natasha's face, and wept on her shoulder with</span>
<span class="s0">sorrowful pleasure.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come, come to him, Mary,&quot; said Natasha, leading her into the</span>
<span class="s0">other room.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. She felt that from her she would be able to understand and</span>
<span class="s0">learn everything.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How...&quot; she began her question but stopped short.</span>

<span class="s0">She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's face eyes would have to tell her all more clearly</span>
<span class="s0">and profoundly.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to</span>
<span class="s0">say all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous</span>
<span class="s0">eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly,</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha's lips twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and</span>
<span class="s0">covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary understood.</span>

<span class="s0">But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But how is his wound? What is his general condition?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You, you... will see,&quot; was all Natasha could say.</span>

<span class="s0">They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had</span>
<span class="s0">left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse?</span>
<span class="s0">When did this happen?&quot; Princess Mary inquired.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his</span>
<span class="s0">feverish condition and the pain he suffered, but at Troitsa that had</span>
<span class="s0">passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger</span>
<span class="s0">had also passed. When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to</span>
<span class="s0">fester (Natasha knew all about such things as festering) and the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course. Then</span>
<span class="s0">fever set in, but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But two days ago this suddenly happened,&quot; said Natasha,</span>
<span class="s0">struggling with her sobs. &quot;I don't know why, but you will see what</span>
<span class="s0">he is like.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is he weaker? Thinner?&quot; asked the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, it's not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too</span>
<span class="s0">good, he cannot, cannot live, because...&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">When Natasha opened Prince Andrew's door with a familiar movement</span>
<span class="s0">and let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt</span>
<span class="s0">the sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself,</span>
<span class="s0">and now tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to</span>
<span class="s0">look at him without tears.</span>

<span class="s0">The princess understood what Natasha had meant by the words: &quot;two</span>
<span class="s0">days ago this suddenly happened.&quot; She understood those words to mean</span>
<span class="s0">that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness</span>
<span class="s0">were signs of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she</span>
<span class="s0">already saw in imagination Andrew's face as she remembered it in</span>
<span class="s0">childhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown,</span>
<span class="s0">and which therefore affected her very strongly. She was sure he</span>
<span class="s0">would speak soft, tender words to her such as her father had uttered</span>
<span class="s0">before his death, and that she would not be able to bear it and</span>
<span class="s0">would burst into sobs in his presence. Yet sooner or later it had to</span>
<span class="s0">be, and she went in. The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat</span>
<span class="s0">as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her</span>
<span class="s0">shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and then she saw his</span>
<span class="s0">face and met his gaze.</span>

<span class="s0">He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan,</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin,</span>
<span class="s0">translucently white hand he held a handkerchief, while with the</span>
<span class="s0">other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown, moving his</span>
<span class="s0">fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they entered.</span>

<span class="s0">On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary's pace</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of</span>
<span class="s0">his face and eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But in what am I to blame?&quot; she asked herself. And his cold,</span>
<span class="s0">stern look replied: &quot;Because you are alive and thinking of the living,</span>
<span class="s0">while I...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but</span>
<span class="s0">inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded</span>
<span class="s0">his sister and Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?&quot; said he in a</span>
<span class="s0">voice as calm and aloof as his look.</span>

<span class="s0">Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such</span>
<span class="s0">horror into Princess Mary's heart as the tone of his voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And have you brought little Nicholas?&quot; he asked in the same slow,</span>
<span class="s0">quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How are you now?&quot; said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she</span>
<span class="s0">was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,&quot; he replied, and again</span>
<span class="s0">making an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips</span>
<span class="s0">only (his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Merci, chere amie, d'etre venue.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Thank you for coming, my dear.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just</span>
<span class="s0">perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She</span>
<span class="s0">now understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words,</span>
<span class="s0">his tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look</span>
<span class="s0">could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world,</span>
<span class="s0">terrible in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he</span>
<span class="s0">understand anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to</span>
<span class="s0">understand, not because he lacked the power to do so but because he</span>
<span class="s0">understood something else--something the living did not and could</span>
<span class="s0">not understand--and which wholly occupied his mind.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">he, breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha. &quot;She looks after</span>
<span class="s0">me all the time.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such</span>
<span class="s0">a thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say</span>
<span class="s0">that, before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to</span>
<span class="s0">live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone.</span>
<span class="s0">If he had not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to</span>
<span class="s0">pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence? The only</span>
<span class="s0">explanation was that he was indifferent, because something else,</span>
<span class="s0">much more important, had been revealed to him.</span>

<span class="s0">The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke</span>
<span class="s0">off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mary came by way of Ryazan,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and</span>
<span class="s0">only after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it</span>
<span class="s0">herself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Really?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was</span>
<span class="s0">making an effort to listen, but could not do so.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, they say it's burned,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a great pity,&quot; and he</span>
<span class="s0">gazed straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his</span>
<span class="s0">fingers.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?&quot; Prince Andrew suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">said, evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. &quot;He wrote here</span>
<span class="s0">that he took a great liking to you,&quot; he went on simply and calmly,</span>
<span class="s0">evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his</span>
<span class="s0">words had for living people. &quot;If you liked him too, it would be a good</span>
<span class="s0">thing for you to get married,&quot; he added rather more quickly, as if</span>
<span class="s0">pleased at having found words he had long been seeking.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her,</span>
<span class="s0">except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why talk of me?&quot; she said quietly and glanced at Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were</span>
<span class="s0">again silent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Andrew, would you like...&quot; Princess Mary suddenly said in a</span>
<span class="s0">trembling voice, &quot;would you like to see little Nicholas? He is</span>
<span class="s0">always talking about you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he</span>
<span class="s0">did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with</span>
<span class="s0">quiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she</span>
<span class="s0">believed to be the last means of arousing him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew's room he looked</span>
<span class="s0">at his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one</span>
<span class="s0">else was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know</span>
<span class="s0">what to say to him.</span>

<span class="s0">When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to</span>
<span class="s0">her brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer</span>
<span class="s0">began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">He looked at her attentively.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it about Nicholas?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mary, you know the Gosp...&quot; but he broke off.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What did you say?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing. You mustn't cry here,&quot; he said, looking at her with the</span>
<span class="s0">same cold expression.</span>


<span class="s0">When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying</span>
<span class="s0">at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father.</span>
<span class="s0">With a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things</span>
<span class="s0">from their point of view.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, to them it must seem sad!&quot; he thought. &quot;But how simple it is.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father</span>
<span class="s0">feedeth them,&quot; he said to himself and wished to say to Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary; &quot;but no, they will take it their own way, they won't understand!</span>
<span class="s0">They can't understand that all those feelings they prize so--all our</span>
<span class="s0">feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are</span>
<span class="s0">unnecessary. We cannot understand one another,&quot; and he remained</span>
<span class="s0">silent.</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and</span>
<span class="s0">knew nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining</span>
<span class="s0">knowledge, observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the</span>
<span class="s0">faculties he afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or</span>
<span class="s0">more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had</span>
<span class="s0">witnessed between his father, Mary, and Natasha, than he had then.</span>
<span class="s0">He understood it completely, and, leaving the room without crying,</span>
<span class="s0">went silently up to Natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly</span>
<span class="s0">at her with his beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy</span>
<span class="s0">upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him</span>
<span class="s0">and either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them</span>
<span class="s0">quietly and shyly.</span>

<span class="s0">When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood</span>
<span class="s0">what Natasha's face had told her. She did not speak any more to</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha of hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside</span>
<span class="s0">his sofa, and did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in</span>
<span class="s0">soul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the</span>
<span class="s0">dying man was now so evident.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he</span>
<span class="s0">was dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an</span>
<span class="s0">aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness</span>
<span class="s0">of existence. Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming.</span>
<span class="s0">That inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which</span>
<span class="s0">he had felt continually all his life--was now near to him and, by</span>
<span class="s0">the strange lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and</span>
<span class="s0">palpable...</span>


<span class="s0">Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that</span>
<span class="s0">terribly tormenting fear of death--the end--but now he no longer</span>
<span class="s0">understood that fear.</span>

 <span class="s0">He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top</span>
<span class="s0">before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the</span>
<span class="s0">sky, and knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to</span>
<span class="s0">himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love</span>
<span class="s0">had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage</span>
<span class="s0">of life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased</span>
<span class="s0">to think about it.</span>

<span class="s0">During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he</span>
<span class="s0">spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new</span>
<span class="s0">principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously</span>
<span class="s0">detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody</span>
<span class="s0">and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not</span>
<span class="s0">to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that</span>
<span class="s0">principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more</span>
<span class="s0">completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which--in the absence of</span>
<span class="s0">such love--stands between life and death. When during those first days</span>
<span class="s0">he remembered that he would have to die, he said to himself: &quot;Well,</span>
<span class="s0">what of it? So much the better!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But after the night in Mytishchi when, half delirious, he had seen</span>
<span class="s0">her for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her</span>
<span class="s0">hand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a</span>
<span class="s0">particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more</span>
<span class="s0">bound him to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy</span>
<span class="s0">his mind. Recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had</span>
<span class="s0">seen Kuragin, he could not now regain the feeling he then had, but was</span>
<span class="s0">tormented by the question whether Kuragin was alive. And he dared</span>
<span class="s0">not inquire.</span>

<span class="s0">His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">referred to when she said: &quot;This suddenly happened,&quot; had occurred</span>
<span class="s0">two days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual</span>
<span class="s0">struggle between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It</span>
<span class="s0">was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life</span>
<span class="s0">as presented to him in the form of his love for Natasha, and a last,</span>
<span class="s0">though ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.</span>

<span class="s0">It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish,</span>
<span class="s0">and his thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sonya was sitting by</span>
<span class="s0">the table. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, she has come!&quot; thought he.</span>

<span class="s0">And so it was: in Sonya's place sat Natasha who had just come in</span>
<span class="s0">noiselessly.</span>

<span class="s0">Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced</span>
<span class="s0">this physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an</span>
<span class="s0">armchair placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from</span>
<span class="s0">him, and was knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings</span>
<span class="s0">since Prince Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick</span>
<span class="s0">so well as old nurses who knit stockings, and that there is</span>
<span class="s0">something soothing in the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked</span>
<span class="s0">lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see</span>
<span class="s0">the thoughtful profile of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball</span>
<span class="s0">rolled off her knees. She started, glanced round at him, and screening</span>
<span class="s0">the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact</span>
<span class="s0">movement, picked up the ball, and regained her former position.</span>

<span class="s0">He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a</span>
<span class="s0">deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed</span>
<span class="s0">cautiously.</span>

<span class="s0">At the Troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had</span>
<span class="s0">told her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound</span>
<span class="s0">which had brought them together again, but after that they never spoke</span>
<span class="s0">of the future.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Can it or can it not be?&quot; he now thought as he looked at her and</span>
<span class="s0">listened to the light click of the steel needles. &quot;Can fate have</span>
<span class="s0">brought me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible</span>
<span class="s0">that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that</span>
<span class="s0">I have spent my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in</span>
<span class="s0">the world! But what am I to do if I love her?&quot; he thought, and he</span>
<span class="s0">involuntarily groaned, from a habit acquired during his sufferings.</span>

<span class="s0">On hearing that sound Natasha put down the stocking, leaned nearer</span>
<span class="s0">to him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to</span>
<span class="s0">him and bent over him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are not asleep?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in.</span>
<span class="s0">No one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do...</span>
<span class="s0">that light. I want to weep for joy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And I!&quot;--She turned away for an instant. &quot;Why too much?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your</span>
<span class="s0">soul, your whole soul--shall I live? What do you think?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am sure of it, sure!&quot; Natasha almost shouted, taking hold of both</span>
<span class="s0">his hands with a passionate movement.</span>

<span class="s0">He remained silent awhile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How good it would be!&quot; and taking her hand he kissed it.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this</span>
<span class="s0">would not do and that he had to be quiet.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But you have not slept,&quot; she said, repressing her joy. &quot;Try to</span>
<span class="s0">sleep... please!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle</span>
<span class="s0">and sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked</span>
<span class="s0">at him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on</span>
<span class="s0">her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep</span>
<span class="s0">long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.</span>

<span class="s0">As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now</span>
<span class="s0">always occupied his mind--about life and death, and chiefly about</span>
<span class="s0">death. He felt himself nearer to it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Love? What is love?&quot; he thought.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I</span>
<span class="s0">understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is,</span>
<span class="s0">everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it</span>
<span class="s0">alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall</span>
<span class="s0">return to the general and eternal source.&quot; These thoughts seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">him comforting. But they were only thoughts. Something was lacking</span>
<span class="s0">in them, they were not clear, they were too one-sidedly personal and</span>
<span class="s0">brain-spun. And there was the former agitation and obscurity. He</span>
<span class="s0">fell asleep.</span>

<span class="s0">He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but</span>
<span class="s0">that he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and</span>
<span class="s0">insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and</span>
<span class="s0">discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had</span>
<span class="s0">more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by</span>
<span class="s0">empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to</span>
<span class="s0">disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded</span>
<span class="s0">all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything</span>
<span class="s0">depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went,</span>
<span class="s0">and tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he</span>
<span class="s0">would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all</span>
<span class="s0">his powers. He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was</span>
<span class="s0">the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was</span>
<span class="s0">clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the</span>
<span class="s0">other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in.</span>
<span class="s0">Something not human--death--was breaking in through that door, and had</span>
<span class="s0">to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it</span>
<span class="s0">back--to lock it was no longer possible--but his efforts were weak and</span>
<span class="s0">clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and</span>
<span class="s0">closed again.</span>

<span class="s0">Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts</span>
<span class="s0">were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It</span>
<span class="s0">entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died.</span>

<span class="s0">But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was</span>
<span class="s0">asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he</span>
<span class="s0">awoke.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it was death! I died--and woke up. Yes, death is an</span>
<span class="s0">awakening!&quot; And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil</span>
<span class="s0">that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual</span>
<span class="s0">vision. He felt as if powers till then confined within him had been</span>
<span class="s0">liberated, and that strange lightness did not again leave him.</span>

<span class="s0">When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan,</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer</span>
<span class="s0">and looked at her strangely, not understanding.</span>

<span class="s0">That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary's</span>
<span class="s0">arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting</span>
<span class="s0">fever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did</span>
<span class="s0">not interest Natasha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her</span>
<span class="s0">were more convincing.</span>

<span class="s0">From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew</span>
<span class="s0">together with his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration</span>
<span class="s0">of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep</span>
<span class="s0">compared to the duration of a dream.</span>

<span class="s0">There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow</span>
<span class="s0">awakening.</span>

<span class="s0">His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary and Natasha, who did not leave him, felt this. They</span>
<span class="s0">did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves</span>
<span class="s0">felt that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he</span>
<span class="s0">had left them) but on what reminded them most closely of him--his</span>
<span class="s0">body. Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of</span>
<span class="s0">death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment</span>
<span class="s0">their grief. Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep,</span>
<span class="s0">nor did they ever talk to one another about him. They felt that they</span>
<span class="s0">could not express in words what they understood.</span>

<span class="s0">They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and</span>
<span class="s0">deeper, away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so</span>
<span class="s0">and that it was right.</span>

<span class="s0">He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of</span>
<span class="s0">him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the</span>
<span class="s0">boy's and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary and Natasha understood that) but simply because he thought it was</span>
<span class="s0">all that was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy,</span>
<span class="s0">he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there</span>
<span class="s0">was anything else he should do.</span>

<span class="s0">When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,</span>
<span class="s0">occurred, Princess Mary and Natasha were present.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it over?&quot; said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes</span>
<span class="s0">lain motionless, growing cold before them. Natasha went up, looked</span>
<span class="s0">at the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but</span>
<span class="s0">did not kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of</span>
<span class="s0">him--his body.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where has he gone? Where is he now?...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,</span>
<span class="s0">everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.</span>

<span class="s0">Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful</span>
<span class="s0">perplexity. The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">because he was no more. The old count cried because he felt that</span>
<span class="s0">before long, he, too, must take the same terrible step.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their</span>
<span class="s0">own personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion</span>
<span class="s0">which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of</span>
<span class="s0">the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in</span>
<span class="s0">their presence.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK THIRTEEN: 1812</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">Man's mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their</span>
<span class="s0">completeness, but the desire to find those causes is implanted in</span>
<span class="s0">man's soul. And without considering the multiplicity and complexity of</span>
<span class="s0">the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the</span>
<span class="s0">cause, he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to</span>
<span class="s0">him intelligible and says: &quot;This is the cause!&quot; In historical events</span>
<span class="s0">(where the actions of men are the subject of observation) the first</span>
<span class="s0">and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the</span>
<span class="s0">gods and, after that, the will of those who stood in the most</span>
<span class="s0">prominent position--the heroes of history. But we need only</span>
<span class="s0">penetrate to the essence of any historic event--which lies in the</span>
<span class="s0">activity of the general mass of men who take part in it--to be</span>
<span class="s0">convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the</span>
<span class="s0">actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may</span>
<span class="s0">seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the</span>
<span class="s0">meaning of historical events this way or that; yet there is the same</span>
<span class="s0">difference between a man who says that the people of the West moved on</span>
<span class="s0">the East because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this</span>
<span class="s0">happened because it had to happen, as there is between those who</span>
<span class="s0">declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved</span>
<span class="s0">round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the</span>
<span class="s0">earth, but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the</span>
<span class="s0">other planets. There is, and can be, no cause of an historical event</span>
<span class="s0">except the one cause of all causes. But there are laws directing</span>
<span class="s0">events, and some of these laws are known to us while we are</span>
<span class="s0">conscious of others we cannot comprehend. The discovery of these</span>
<span class="s0">laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the</span>
<span class="s0">attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man, just as the</span>
<span class="s0">discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only</span>
<span class="s0">when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth.</span>

<span class="s0">The historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodino and the</span>
<span class="s0">occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the</span>
<span class="s0">most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian army from the Ryazana to the Kaluga road and to the Tarutino</span>
<span class="s0">camp--the so-called flank march across the Krasnaya Pakhra River. They</span>
<span class="s0">ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and</span>
<span class="s0">dispute as to whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians,</span>
<span class="s0">including the French, acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders</span>
<span class="s0">when they speak of that flank march. But it is hard to understand</span>
<span class="s0">why military writers, and following them others, consider this flank</span>
<span class="s0">march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved Russia</span>
<span class="s0">and destroyed Napoleon. In the first place it is hard to understand</span>
<span class="s0">where the profundity and genius of this movement lay, for not much</span>
<span class="s0">mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army</span>
<span class="s0">when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions;</span>
<span class="s0">and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best</span>
<span class="s0">position for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on</span>
<span class="s0">the Kaluga road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning</span>
<span class="s0">the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a</span>
<span class="s0">profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why</span>
<span class="s0">they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and</span>
<span class="s0">destroy the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded,</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied, or followed by other circumstances, might have proved</span>
<span class="s0">ruinous to the Russians and salutary for the French. If the position</span>
<span class="s0">of the Russian army really began to improve from the time of that</span>
<span class="s0">march, it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it.</span>

<span class="s0">That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its</span>
<span class="s0">destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If</span>
<span class="s0">Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained</span>
<span class="s0">inactive? If the Russian army at Krasnaya Pakhra had given battle as</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French</span>
<span class="s0">attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhra? What</span>
<span class="s0">would have happened if on approaching Tarutino, Napoleon had</span>
<span class="s0">attacked the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when</span>
<span class="s0">he attacked them at Smolensk? What would have happened had the</span>
<span class="s0">French moved on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank</span>
<span class="s0">march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous.</span>

<span class="s0">The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying</span>
<span class="s0">history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be</span>
<span class="s0">attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in</span>
<span class="s0">reality, like the retreat from Fili, it did not suggest itself to</span>
<span class="s0">anyone in its entirety, but resulted--moment by moment, step by</span>
<span class="s0">step, event by event--from an endless number of most diverse</span>
<span class="s0">circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished and belonged to the past.</span>

<span class="s0">At the council at Fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely,</span>
<span class="s0">a direct retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of this there is the</span>
<span class="s0">fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and</span>
<span class="s0">above all there is the well-known conversation after the council,</span>
<span class="s0">between the commander in chief and Lanskoy, who was in charge of the</span>
<span class="s0">commissariat department. Lanskoy informed the commander in chief</span>
<span class="s0">that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the Oka</span>
<span class="s0">in the Tula and Ryazan provinces, and that if they retreated on Nizhni</span>
<span class="s0">the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river</span>
<span class="s0">Oka, which cannot be crossed early in winter. This was the first</span>
<span class="s0">indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously</span>
<span class="s0">seemed the most natural course--a direct retreat on Nizhni-Novgorod.</span>
<span class="s0">The army turned more to the south, along the Ryazan road and nearer to</span>
<span class="s0">its supplies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French (who even</span>
<span class="s0">lost sight of the Russian army), concern for the safety of the arsenal</span>
<span class="s0">at Tula, and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its</span>
<span class="s0">supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the Tula road.</span>
<span class="s0">Having crossed over, by a forced march, to the Tula road beyond the</span>
<span class="s0">Pakhra, the Russian commanders intended to remain at Podolsk and had</span>
<span class="s0">no thought of the Tarutino position; but innumerable circumstances and</span>
<span class="s0">the reappearance of French troops who had for a time lost touch with</span>
<span class="s0">the Russians, and projects of giving battle, and above all the</span>
<span class="s0">abundance of provisions in Kaluga province, obliged our army to turn</span>
<span class="s0">still more to the south and to cross from the Tula to the Kaluga</span>
<span class="s0">road and go to Tarutino, which was between the roads along which those</span>
<span class="s0">supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to</span>
<span class="s0">abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say precisely when, or by whom,</span>
<span class="s0">it was decided to move to Tarutino. Only when the army had got</span>
<span class="s0">there, as the result of innumerable and varying forces, did people</span>
<span class="s0">begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and</span>
<span class="s0">long ago foreseen its result.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the</span>
<span class="s0">advance of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been</span>
<span class="s0">continually retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated</span>
<span class="s0">from that direct course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally</span>
<span class="s0">drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant.</span>

<span class="s0">If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could</span>
<span class="s0">not have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be</span>
<span class="s0">found and where the country was richest.</span>

<span class="s0">That movement from the Nizhni to the Ryazan, Tula, and Kaluga</span>
<span class="s0">roads was so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that</span>
<span class="s0">direction, and demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutuzov to take</span>
<span class="s0">his army that way. At Tarutino Kutuzov received what was almost a</span>
<span class="s0">reprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army along the</span>
<span class="s0">Ryazan road, and the Emperor's letter indicated to him the very</span>
<span class="s0">position he had already occupied near Kaluga.</span>

<span class="s0">Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by</span>
<span class="s0">the whole campaign and by the battle of Borodino, the Russian army-</span>
<span class="s0">when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push</span>
<span class="s0">was received--assumed the position natural to it.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as</span>
<span class="s0">it is called, but in the fact that he alone understood the</span>
<span class="s0">significance of what had happened. He alone then understood the</span>
<span class="s0">meaning of the French army's inactivity, he alone continued to</span>
<span class="s0">assert that the battle of Borodino had been a victory, he alone--who</span>
<span class="s0">as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to</span>
<span class="s0">attack--employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian army</span>
<span class="s0">from useless engagements.</span>

<span class="s0">The beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had</span>
<span class="s0">left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and</span>
<span class="s0">merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was</span>
<span class="s0">heard to moan.</span>

<span class="s0">The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed</span>
<span class="s0">its calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">camp with overtures for peace.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head</span>
<span class="s0">was right, wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him,</span>
<span class="s0">though they were meaningless.</span>


<span class="s0">MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my</span>
<span class="s0">adjutants-general to discuss several interesting questions with you. I</span>
<span class="s0">beg your Highness to credit what he says to you, especially when he</span>
<span class="s0">expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long</span>
<span class="s0">entertained for your person. This letter having no other object, I</span>
<span class="s0">pray God, monsieur le Prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and</span>
<span class="s0">gracious protection!</span>

<span class="s0">NAPOLEON</span>

<span class="s0">MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812</span>


<span class="s0">Kutuzov replied: &quot;I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on</span>
<span class="s0">as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present</span>
<span class="s0">spirit of my nation.&quot; But he continued to exert all his powers to</span>
<span class="s0">restrain his troops from attacking.</span>

<span class="s0">During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarutino, a change had</span>
<span class="s0">taken place in the relative strength of the two armies--both in spirit</span>
<span class="s0">and in number--as a result of which the superiority had passed to</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French</span>
<span class="s0">army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the</span>
<span class="s0">need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These</span>
<span class="s0">signs were: Lauriston's mission; the abundance of provisions at</span>
<span class="s0">Tarutino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and</span>
<span class="s0">disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the</span>
<span class="s0">fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and</span>
<span class="s0">the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually</span>
<span class="s0">shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what</span>
<span class="s0">the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with</span>
<span class="s0">which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at</span>
<span class="s0">Tarutino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and</span>
<span class="s0">guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire</span>
<span class="s0">for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the</span>
<span class="s0">French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every</span>
<span class="s0">soldier's mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed</span>
<span class="s0">and that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial</span>
<span class="s0">change in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable.</span>
<span class="s0">And at once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the</span>
<span class="s0">minute hand has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an</span>
<span class="s0">increased activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">The Russian army was commanded by Kutuzov and his staff, and also by</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole</span>
<span class="s0">campaign had been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for his guidance.</span>
<span class="s0">Though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">was still in our hands, it was approved by the staff and accepted as a</span>
<span class="s0">basis for action. Kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from</span>
<span class="s0">a distance were always difficult to execute. So fresh instructions</span>
<span class="s0">were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be</span>
<span class="s0">encountered, as well as fresh people who were to watch Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">actions and report upon them.</span>

<span class="s0">Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now</span>
<span class="s0">reorganized. The posts left vacant by Bagration, who had been</span>
<span class="s0">killed, and by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be</span>
<span class="s0">filled. Very serious consideration was given to the question whether</span>
<span class="s0">it would be better to put A in B's place and B in D's, or on the</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to put D in A's place, and so on--as if anything more than</span>
<span class="s0">A's or B's satisfaction depended on this.</span>

<span class="s0">As a result of the hostility between Kutuzov and Bennigsen, his</span>
<span class="s0">Chief of Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, and these transfers, a more than usually complicated play</span>
<span class="s0">of parties was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining</span>
<span class="s0">B, D was undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and</span>
<span class="s0">permutations. In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was</span>
<span class="s0">generally the conduct of the war, which all these men believed they</span>
<span class="s0">were directing; but this affair of the war went on independently of</span>
<span class="s0">them, as it had to go: that is, never in the way people devised, but</span>
<span class="s0">flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses. Only in</span>
<span class="s0">the highest spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and</span>
<span class="s0">interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen.</span>


<span class="s0">Prince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of</span>
<span class="s0">October in a letter that reached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino)</span>
<span class="s0">Since September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last</span>
<span class="s0">reports were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not</span>
<span class="s0">only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of</span>
<span class="s0">the ancient capital, but according to your last report you have even</span>
<span class="s0">retreated farther. Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy</span>
<span class="s0">detachment and Tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the</span>
<span class="s0">army, is in danger. From General Wintzingerode's reports, I see that</span>
<span class="s0">an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road.</span>
<span class="s0">Another corps of several thousand men is moving on Dmitrov. A third</span>
<span class="s0">has advanced along the Vladimir road, and a fourth, rather</span>
<span class="s0">considerable detachment is stationed between Ruza and Mozhaysk.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth. In view of</span>
<span class="s0">all this information, when the enemy has scattered his forces in large</span>
<span class="s0">detachments, and with Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it</span>
<span class="s0">possible that the enemy's forces confronting you are so considerable</span>
<span class="s0">as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is</span>
<span class="s0">probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with an army</span>
<span class="s0">corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem</span>
<span class="s0">that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might</span>
<span class="s0">advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least</span>
<span class="s0">oblige him to retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the</span>
<span class="s0">provinces now occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger</span>
<span class="s0">from Tula and other towns in the interior. You will be responsible</span>
<span class="s0">if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been</span>
<span class="s0">possible to retain many troops; for with the army entrusted to you,</span>
<span class="s0">and acting with resolution and energy, you have ample means to avert</span>
<span class="s0">this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still to answer to our</span>
<span class="s0">offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have experienced my</span>
<span class="s0">readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken in me, but I</span>
<span class="s0">and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and</span>
<span class="s0">success which your intellect, military talent, and the courage of</span>
<span class="s0">the troops you command justify us in expecting.</span>


<span class="s0">But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation</span>
<span class="s0">of the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was</span>
<span class="s0">dispatched, Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain</span>
<span class="s0">the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.</span>

<span class="s0">On the second of October a Cossack, Shapovalov, who was out</span>
<span class="s0">scouting, killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded</span>
<span class="s0">hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left</span>
<span class="s0">flank of Murat's army, encamped there without any precautions. The</span>
<span class="s0">Cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the</span>
<span class="s0">hands of the French. A cornet, hearing the story, informed his</span>
<span class="s0">commander.</span>

<span class="s0">The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished</span>
<span class="s0">to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of</span>
<span class="s0">the superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,</span>
<span class="s0">reported the incident to a general on the staff.  The state of</span>
<span class="s0">things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Ermolov had</span>
<span class="s0">been to see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to</span>
<span class="s0">use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take</span>
<span class="s0">the offensive.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you</span>
<span class="s0">are asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure</span>
<span class="s0">to do the opposite,&quot; replied Bennigsen.</span>

<span class="s0">The Cossack's report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent</span>
<span class="s0">out, was the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled</span>
<span class="s0">spring was released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to</span>
<span class="s0">play. Despite all his supposed power, his intellect, his experience,</span>
<span class="s0">and his knowledge of men, Kutuzov--having taken into consideration the</span>
<span class="s0">Cossack's report, a note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the</span>
<span class="s0">fact that all the generals expressed the same wish--could no longer</span>
<span class="s0">check the inevitable movement, and gave the order to do what he</span>
<span class="s0">regarded as useless and harmful--gave his approval, that is, to the</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished fact.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">Bennigsen's note and the Cossack's information that the left flank</span>
<span class="s0">of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it</span>
<span class="s0">was necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of</span>
<span class="s0">October.</span>

<span class="s0">On the morning of the fourth of October Kutuzov signed the</span>
<span class="s0">dispositions. Toll read them to Ermolov, asking him to attend to the</span>
<span class="s0">further arrangements.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right--all right. I haven't time just now,&quot; replied Ermolov,</span>
<span class="s0">and left the hut.</span>

<span class="s0">The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the</span>
<span class="s0">Austerlitz dispositions, it was written--though not in German this</span>
<span class="s0">time:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The First Column will march here and here,&quot; &quot;the Second Column will</span>
<span class="s0">march there and there,&quot; and so on; and on paper, all these columns</span>
<span class="s0">arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.</span>
<span class="s0">Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,</span>
<span class="s0">and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at</span>
<span class="s0">the appointed time.</span>

<span class="s0">When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been</span>
<span class="s0">prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to</span>
<span class="s0">Ermolov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutuzov's</span>
<span class="s0">orderly, pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him,</span>
<span class="s0">went to Ermolov's quarters.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Gone away,&quot; said Ermolov's orderly.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom</span>
<span class="s0">Ermolov was often to be found.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, and the general's out too.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, he's gone out.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If only they don't make me responsible for this delay! What a</span>
<span class="s0">nuisance it is!&quot; thought the officer, and he rode round the whole</span>
<span class="s0">camp. One man said he had seen Ermolov ride past with some other</span>
<span class="s0">generals, others said he must have returned home. The officer searched</span>
<span class="s0">till six o'clock in the evening without even stopping to eat.</span>
<span class="s0">Ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was. The</span>
<span class="s0">officer snatched a little food at a comrade's, and rode again to the</span>
<span class="s0">vanguard to find Miloradovich. Miloradovich too was away, but here</span>
<span class="s0">he was told that he had gone to a ball at General Kikin's and that</span>
<span class="s0">Ermolov was probably there too.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But where is it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, there, over at Echkino,&quot; said a Cossack officer, pointing to a</span>
<span class="s0">country house in the far distance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What, outside our line?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They've put two regiments as outposts, and they're having such a</span>
<span class="s0">spree there, it's awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino. While still at a</span>
<span class="s0">distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance</span>
<span class="s0">song proceeding from the house.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;In the meadows... in the meadows!&quot; he heard, accompanied by</span>
<span class="s0">whistling and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by</span>
<span class="s0">shouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he</span>
<span class="s0">was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner</span>
<span class="s0">the important order entrusted to him. It was already past eight</span>
<span class="s0">o'clock. He dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country</span>
<span class="s0">house which had remained intact between the Russian and French forces.</span>
<span class="s0">In the refreshment room and the hall, footmen were bustling about with</span>
<span class="s0">wine and viands. Groups of singers stood outside the windows. The</span>
<span class="s0">officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the</span>
<span class="s0">army together, and among them Ermolov's big imposing figure. They</span>
<span class="s0">all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle</span>
<span class="s0">with flushed and animated faces, laughing loudly. In the middle of the</span>
<span class="s0">room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak</span>
<span class="s0">with much spirit and agility.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivanych! Ha, ha, ha!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a</span>
<span class="s0">moment he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait;</span>
<span class="s0">but one of the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come</span>
<span class="s0">about, informed Ermolov.</span>

<span class="s0">Ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what</span>
<span class="s0">the officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;You think he went off just by chance?&quot; said a comrade, who was on</span>
<span class="s0">the staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards,</span>
<span class="s0">referring to Ermolov. &quot;It was a trick. It was done on purpose to get</span>
<span class="s0">Konovnitsyn into trouble. You'll see what a mess there'll be</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">Next day the decrepit Kutuzov, having given orders to be called</span>
<span class="s0">early, said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of,</span>
<span class="s0">got into his caleche and drove from Letashovka (a village three and</span>
<span class="s0">a half miles from Tarutino) to the place where the attacking columns</span>
<span class="s0">were to meet. He sat in the caleche, dozing and waking up by turns,</span>
<span class="s0">and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication</span>
<span class="s0">that the action had begun. But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn</span>
<span class="s0">morning was just dawning. On approaching Tarutino Kutuzov noticed</span>
<span class="s0">cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which</span>
<span class="s0">he was driving. Kutuzov looked at them searchingly, stopped his</span>
<span class="s0">carriage, and inquired what regiment they belonged to. They belonged</span>
<span class="s0">to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long</span>
<span class="s0">before then. &quot;It may be a mistake,&quot; thought the old commander in</span>
<span class="s0">chief. But a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their</span>
<span class="s0">arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed, eating their rye</span>
<span class="s0">porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The officer</span>
<span class="s0">reported that no order to advance had been received.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How! Not rec...&quot; Kutuzov began, but checked himself immediately and</span>
<span class="s0">sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his caleche, he waited</span>
<span class="s0">with drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down.</span>
<span class="s0">When Eykhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned,</span>
<span class="s0">appeared, Kutuzov went purple in the face, not because that officer</span>
<span class="s0">was to blame for the mistake, but because he was an object of</span>
<span class="s0">sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and</span>
<span class="s0">panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">used to roll on the ground, and he fell upon Eykhen, threatening him</span>
<span class="s0">with his hands, shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another</span>
<span class="s0">man, Captain Brozin, who happened to turn up and who was not at all to</span>
<span class="s0">blame, suffered the same fate.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What sort of another blackguard are you? I'll have you shot!</span>
<span class="s0">Scoundrels!&quot; yelled Kutuzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and</span>
<span class="s0">reeling.</span>

<span class="s0">He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene</span>
<span class="s0">Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever</span>
<span class="s0">had in Russia, to be placed in this position--made the laughingstock</span>
<span class="s0">of the whole army! &quot;I needn't have been in such a hurry to pray</span>
<span class="s0">about today, or have kept awake thinking everything over all night,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">thought he to himself. &quot;When I was a chit of an officer no one would</span>
<span class="s0">have dared to mock me so... and now!&quot; He was in a state of physical</span>
<span class="s0">suffering as if from corporal punishment, and could not avoid</span>
<span class="s0">expressing it by cries of anger and distress. But his strength soon</span>
<span class="s0">began to fail him, and looking about him, conscious of having said</span>
<span class="s0">much that was amiss, he again got into his caleche and drove back in</span>
<span class="s0">silence.</span>

<span class="s0">His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he</span>
<span class="s0">listened to excuses and self-justifications (Ermolov did not come to</span>
<span class="s0">see him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen,</span>
<span class="s0">Konovnitsyn, and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should</span>
<span class="s0">be executed next day. And once more Kutuzov had to consent.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the</span>
<span class="s0">evening and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with</span>
<span class="s0">dark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy,</span>
<span class="s0">and the troops advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of</span>
<span class="s0">the artillery could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk</span>
<span class="s0">out loud, to smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried</span>
<span class="s0">to prevent their horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking</span>
<span class="s0">heightened its charm and they marched gaily. Some columns,</span>
<span class="s0">supposing they had reached their destination, halted, piled arms, and</span>
<span class="s0">settled down on the cold ground, but the majority marched all night</span>
<span class="s0">and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been.</span>

<span class="s0">Only Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cossacks (the least important</span>
<span class="s0">detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time.</span>
<span class="s0">This detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path</span>
<span class="s0">leading from the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk.</span>

<span class="s0">Toward dawn, Count Orlov-Denisov, who had dozed off, was awakened by</span>
<span class="s0">a deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a</span>
<span class="s0">Polish sergeant of Poniatowski's corps, who explained in Polish that</span>
<span class="s0">he had come over because he had been slighted in the service: that</span>
<span class="s0">he ought long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver</span>
<span class="s0">than any of them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them</span>
<span class="s0">out. He said that Murat was spending the night less than a mile from</span>
<span class="s0">where they were, and that if they would let him have a convoy of a</span>
<span class="s0">hundred men he would capture him alive. Count Orlov-Denisov</span>
<span class="s0">consulted his fellow officers.</span>

<span class="s0">The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go</span>
<span class="s0">and everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and</span>
<span class="s0">arguing, Major-General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided to go</span>
<span class="s0">with the Polish sergeant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, remember,&quot; said Count Orlov-Denisov to the sergeant at</span>
<span class="s0">parting, &quot;if you have been lying I'll have you hanged like a dog;</span>
<span class="s0">but if it's true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and</span>
<span class="s0">rode away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled. They</span>
<span class="s0">disappeared into the forest, and Count Orlov-Denisov, having seen</span>
<span class="s0">Grekov off, returned, shivering from the freshness of the early dawn</span>
<span class="s0">and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility, and</span>
<span class="s0">began looking at the enemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive</span>
<span class="s0">light of dawn and the dying campfires. Our columns ought to have begun</span>
<span class="s0">to appear on an open declivity to his right. He looked in that</span>
<span class="s0">direction, but though the columns would have been visible quite far</span>
<span class="s0">off, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count that things were</span>
<span class="s0">beginning to stir in the French camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant</span>
<span class="s0">confirmed this.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, it is really too late,&quot; said Count Orlov, looking at the camp.</span>

<span class="s0">As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before</span>
<span class="s0">our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the</span>
<span class="s0">sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian</span>
<span class="s0">attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which he</span>
<span class="s0">would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a</span>
<span class="s0">commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am sure that rascal was lying,&quot; said the count.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They can still be called back,&quot; said one of his suite, who like</span>
<span class="s0">Count Orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the</span>
<span class="s0">enemy's camp.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Will you have them fetched back?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fetch them back, fetch them back!&quot; said Count Orlov with sudden</span>
<span class="s0">determination, looking at his watch. &quot;It will be too late. It is quite</span>
<span class="s0">light.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grekov. When</span>
<span class="s0">Grekov returned, Count Orlov-Denisov, excited both by the abandoned</span>
<span class="s0">attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not</span>
<span class="s0">appear, as well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance.</span>
<span class="s0">All his men felt the same excitement.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mount!&quot; he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and</span>
<span class="s0">crossed themselves.... &quot;Forward, with God's aid!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hurrah-ah-ah!&quot; reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack</span>
<span class="s0">companies, trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if</span>
<span class="s0">poured out of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.</span>

<span class="s0">One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw</span>
<span class="s0">the Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just</span>
<span class="s0">waking up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and</span>
<span class="s0">horses.</span>

<span class="s0">Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind</span>
<span class="s0">and around them, they would have captured Murat and everything</span>
<span class="s0">there. That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to</span>
<span class="s0">make the Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners.</span>
<span class="s0">None of them listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and</span>
<span class="s0">thirty-eight guns were taken on the spot, besides standards and</span>
<span class="s0">(what seemed most important to the Cossacks) horses, saddles,</span>
<span class="s0">horsecloths, and the like. All this had to be dealt with, the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided--not without some</span>
<span class="s0">shouting and even a little themselves--and it was on this that the</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks all busied themselves.</span>

<span class="s0">The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover</span>
<span class="s0">themselves: they formed into detachments and began firing.</span>
<span class="s0">Orlov-Denisov, still waiting for the other columns to arrive, advanced</span>
<span class="s0">no further.</span>

<span class="s0">Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that &quot;the First</span>
<span class="s0">Column will march&quot; and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,</span>
<span class="s0">commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due</span>
<span class="s0">order and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their</span>
<span class="s0">appointed places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully,</span>
<span class="s0">began to halt; murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and</span>
<span class="s0">finally a backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about,</span>
<span class="s0">shouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and</span>
<span class="s0">were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and</span>
<span class="s0">went forward, simply to get somewhere. &quot;We shall get somewhere or</span>
<span class="s0">other!&quot; And they did indeed get somewhere, though not to their right</span>
<span class="s0">places; a few eventually even got to their right place, but too late</span>
<span class="s0">to be of any use and only in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this</span>
<span class="s0">battle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped</span>
<span class="s0">assiduously from place to place, finding everything upside down</span>
<span class="s0">everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagovut's corps in a wood when it</span>
<span class="s0">was already broad daylight, though the corps should long before have</span>
<span class="s0">joined Orlov-Denisov. Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing</span>
<span class="s0">that someone must be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the</span>
<span class="s0">commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely, saying</span>
<span class="s0">that he ought to be shot. General Bagovut, a fighting old soldier of</span>
<span class="s0">placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion,</span>
<span class="s0">and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's surprise and quite</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men</span>
<span class="s0">as well as anybody,&quot; he said, and advanced with a single division.</span>

<span class="s0">Coming out onto a field under the enemy's fire, this brave general</span>
<span class="s0">went straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering</span>
<span class="s0">in his agitation whether going into action now, with a single</span>
<span class="s0">division, would be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets</span>
<span class="s0">were just what he needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets</span>
<span class="s0">killed him, and other bullets killed many of his men. And his division</span>
<span class="s0">remained under fire for some time quite uselessly.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the</span>
<span class="s0">front, but Kutuzov accompanied that column. He well knew that</span>
<span class="s0">nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his</span>
<span class="s0">will, and as far as was in his power held the troops back. He did</span>
<span class="s0">not advance.</span>

<span class="s0">He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering</span>
<span class="s0">suggestions that they should attack.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The word attack is always on your tongue, but you don't see that we</span>
<span class="s0">are unable to execute complicated maneuvers,&quot; said he to</span>
<span class="s0">Miloradovich who asked permission to advance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We couldn't take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in</span>
<span class="s0">time, and nothing can be done now!&quot; he replied to someone else.</span>

<span class="s0">When Kutuzov was informed that at the French rear--where according</span>
<span class="s0">to the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody--there</span>
<span class="s0">were now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Ermolov</span>
<span class="s0">who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous</span>
<span class="s0">day.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,</span>
<span class="s0">but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,</span>
<span class="s0">forewarned, takes measures accordingly.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these</span>
<span class="s0">words. He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov would content himself with that hint.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's having a little fun at my expense,&quot; said Ermolov softly,</span>
<span class="s0">nudging with his knee Raevski who was at his side.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after this, Ermolov moved up to Kutuzov and respectfully</span>
<span class="s0">remarked:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is not too late yet, your Highness--the enemy has not gone away-</span>
<span class="s0">if you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as</span>
<span class="s0">see a little smoke.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat's</span>
<span class="s0">troops were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every</span>
<span class="s0">hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour.</span>

<span class="s0">The whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov's Cossacks had</span>
<span class="s0">done: the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.</span>

<span class="s0">In consequence of this battle Kutuzov received a diamond decoration,</span>
<span class="s0">and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also</span>
<span class="s0">received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various</span>
<span class="s0">grades, and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be</span>
<span class="s0">understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that</span>
<span class="s0">we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today.</span>
<span class="s0">But people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking</span>
<span class="s0">about or deliberately deceive themselves. No battle--Tarutino,</span>
<span class="s0">Borodino, or Austerlitz--takes place as those who planned it</span>
<span class="s0">anticipated. That is an essential condition.</span>

<span class="s0">A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than</span>
<span class="s0">during a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence</span>
<span class="s0">the course taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in</span>
<span class="s0">advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force.</span>

<span class="s0">If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a</span>
<span class="s0">given body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one</span>
<span class="s0">of those forces, but will always be a mean--what in mechanics is</span>
<span class="s0">represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.</span>

<span class="s0">If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French</span>
<span class="s0">ones, we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with</span>
<span class="s0">previously formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those</span>
<span class="s0">descriptions are false.</span>

<span class="s0">The battle of Tarutino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had</span>
<span class="s0">in view--to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the</span>
<span class="s0">dispositions; nor that which Count Orlov-Denisov may have had in view-</span>
<span class="s0">to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the</span>
<span class="s0">whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor</span>
<span class="s0">the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish</span>
<span class="s0">himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got,</span>
<span class="s0">and so on. But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and</span>
<span class="s0">what all the Russians of that day desired--to drive the French out</span>
<span class="s0">of Russia and destroy their army--it is quite clear that the battle of</span>
<span class="s0">Tarutino, just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was</span>
<span class="s0">wanted at that stage of the campaign. It would be difficult and even</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual</span>
<span class="s0">outcome of this battle. With a minimum of effort and insignificant</span>
<span class="s0">losses, despite the greatest confusion, the most important results</span>
<span class="s0">of the whole campaign were attained: the transition from retreat to</span>
<span class="s0">advance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the</span>
<span class="s0">administration of that shock which Napoleon's army had only awaited to</span>
<span class="s0">begin its flight.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa;</span>
<span class="s0">there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in</span>
<span class="s0">the hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their</span>
<span class="s0">ancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and</span>
<span class="s0">incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon's hands. The Russian army, only</span>
<span class="s0">half the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to</span>
<span class="s0">attack for a whole month. Napoleon's position is most brilliant. He</span>
<span class="s0">can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and</span>
<span class="s0">destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal</span>
<span class="s0">make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse,</span>
<span class="s0">return to Smolensk or Vilna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special</span>
<span class="s0">genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position</span>
<span class="s0">the French held at that time. For that, only very simple and easy</span>
<span class="s0">steps were necessary: not to allow the troops to loot, to prepare</span>
<span class="s0">winter clothing--of which there was sufficient in Moscow for the whole</span>
<span class="s0">army--and methodically to collect the provisions, of which</span>
<span class="s0">(according to the French historians) there were enough in Moscow to</span>
<span class="s0">supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of</span>
<span class="s0">all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of the army, took</span>
<span class="s0">none of these steps.</span>

<span class="s0">He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used</span>
<span class="s0">his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses</span>
<span class="s0">open to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, advancing on Petersburg or on Nizhni-Novgorod, or retiring</span>
<span class="s0">by a more northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">afterwards took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined</span>
<span class="s0">than what he actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting</span>
<span class="s0">the troops plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a</span>
<span class="s0">garrison behind him, he quitted Moscow, approached Kutuzov without</span>
<span class="s0">joining battle, turned to the right and reached Malo-Yaroslavets,</span>
<span class="s0">again without attempting to break through and take the road Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">took, but retiring instead to Mozhaysk along the devastated Smolensk</span>
<span class="s0">road. Nothing more stupid than that could have been devised, or more</span>
<span class="s0">disastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon's aim been</span>
<span class="s0">to destroy his army, the most skillful strategist could hardly have</span>
<span class="s0">devised any series of actions that would so completely have</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished that purpose, independently of anything the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">army might do.</span>


<span class="s0">Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed his army because he wished to, or because he was very</span>
<span class="s0">stupid, would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a</span>
<span class="s0">genius.</span>

<span class="s0">In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the</span>
<span class="s0">personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws</span>
<span class="s0">that guided the event.</span>

<span class="s0">The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon's faculties as</span>
<span class="s0">having weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did</span>
<span class="s0">not justify his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to</span>
<span class="s0">do the best he could for himself and his army, as he had done</span>
<span class="s0">previously and as he did subsequently in 1813. His activity at that</span>
<span class="s0">time was no less astounding than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in</span>
<span class="s0">Austria, and in Prussia. We do not know for certain in how far his</span>
<span class="s0">genius was genuine in Egypt--where forty centuries looked down upon</span>
<span class="s0">his grandeur--for his great exploits there are all told us by</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria or</span>
<span class="s0">Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French or German</span>
<span class="s0">sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without</span>
<span class="s0">fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans to</span>
<span class="s0">recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on</span>
<span class="s0">in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius in</span>
<span class="s0">order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the</span>
<span class="s0">matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.</span>

<span class="s0">His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as</span>
<span class="s0">elsewhere. Order after order order and plan after plan were issued</span>
<span class="s0">by him from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The</span>
<span class="s0">absence of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, did not disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the</span>
<span class="s0">welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare</span>
<span class="s0">of the people of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or</span>
<span class="s0">of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated</span>
<span class="s0">peace.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry</span>
<span class="s0">into Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the</span>
<span class="s0">movements of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different</span>
<span class="s0">roads, and charged Murat to find Kutuzov. Then he gave careful</span>
<span class="s0">directions about the fortification of the Kremlin, and drew up a</span>
<span class="s0">brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of Russia.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain</span>
<span class="s0">Yakovlev, who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how</span>
<span class="s0">to get out of Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and</span>
<span class="s0">his magnanimity, and having written a letter to the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his Friend</span>
<span class="s0">and Brother that Rostopchin had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he</span>
<span class="s0">dispatched Yakovlev to Petersburg.</span>

<span class="s0">Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to</span>
<span class="s0">Tutolmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave</span>
<span class="s0">orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin was punished by an order to burn down his houses.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a</span>
<span class="s0">constitution. A municipality was established and the following</span>
<span class="s0">announcement issued:</span>


<span class="s0">INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!</span>

<span class="s0">Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King</span>
<span class="s0">desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you</span>
<span class="s0">how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been</span>
<span class="s0">taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A</span>
<span class="s0">paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form</span>
<span class="s0">your municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of</span>
<span class="s0">your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished</span>
<span class="s0">by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city</span>
<span class="s0">will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only</span>
<span class="s0">wear a red ribbon round the left arm.</span>

<span class="s0">The city police is established on its former footing, and better</span>
<span class="s0">order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The</span>
<span class="s0">government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of</span>
<span class="s0">police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been</span>
<span class="s0">appointed to the different wards of the city. You will recognize</span>
<span class="s0">them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several</span>
<span class="s0">churches of different denominations are open, and divine service is</span>
<span class="s0">performed in them unhindered. Your fellow citizens are returning every</span>
<span class="s0">day to their homes. and orders have been given that they should find</span>
<span class="s0">in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes. These are</span>
<span class="s0">the measures the government has adopted to re-establish order and</span>
<span class="s0">relieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it is necessary that</span>
<span class="s0">you should add your efforts and should, if possible, forget the</span>
<span class="s0">misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain the hope of a less</span>
<span class="s0">cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death</span>
<span class="s0">awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains</span>
<span class="s0">of your property, and finally that you should not doubt that these</span>
<span class="s0">will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest and most</span>
<span class="s0">just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you may</span>
<span class="s0">be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of a</span>
<span class="s0">state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to</span>
<span class="s0">another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the</span>
<span class="s0">military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to</span>
<span class="s0">flow!</span>


<span class="s0">With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all</span>
<span class="s0">the troops in turn should enter Moscow a la maraude* to obtain</span>
<span class="s0">provisions for themselves, so that the army might have its future</span>
<span class="s0">provided for.</span>


<span class="s0">*As looters.</span>


<span class="s0">With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be</span>
<span class="s0">brought back and services to be again performed in the churches.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the</span>
<span class="s0">following was placarded everywhere:</span>


<span class="s0">PROCLAMATION!</span>

<span class="s0">You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom</span>
<span class="s0">misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of</span>
<span class="s0">the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!</span>
<span class="s0">Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being</span>
<span class="s0">restored in it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from</span>
<span class="s0">their hiding places on finding that they are respected. Any violence</span>
<span class="s0">to them or to their property is promptly punished. His Majesty the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor and King protects them, and considers no one among you his</span>
<span class="s0">enemy except those who disobey his orders. He desires to end your</span>
<span class="s0">misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families. Respond,</span>
<span class="s0">therefore, to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear.</span>
<span class="s0">Inhabitants, return with confidence to your abodes! You will soon find</span>
<span class="s0">means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen and industrious artisans,</span>
<span class="s0">return to your work, your houses, your shops, where the protection</span>
<span class="s0">of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay for your work.</span>
<span class="s0">And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where you are</span>
<span class="s0">hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full</span>
<span class="s0">assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in</span>
<span class="s0">the city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the</span>
<span class="s0">products of the soil. The government has taken the following steps</span>
<span class="s0">to ensure freedom of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants,</span>
<span class="s0">husbandmen, and those living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without</span>
<span class="s0">any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets,</span>
<span class="s0">of which one is on the Mokhovaya Street and the other at the Provision</span>
<span class="s0">Market. (2) Such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as</span>
<span class="s0">seller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a</span>
<span class="s0">fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and</span>
<span class="s0">no one may hinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday</span>
<span class="s0">of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end</span>
<span class="s0">a sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on</span>
<span class="s0">Tuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect</span>
<span class="s0">the carts. (4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their</span>
<span class="s0">carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey.</span>
<span class="s0">(5) Steps will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.</span>

<span class="s0">Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and</span>
<span class="s0">artisans, to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry</span>
<span class="s0">out the paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to</span>
<span class="s0">co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and</span>
<span class="s0">confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!</span>


<span class="s0">With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the</span>
<span class="s0">people, reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and,</span>
<span class="s0">despite his preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the</span>
<span class="s0">theaters that were established by his order.</span>

<span class="s0">In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma</span>
<span class="s0">Mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining</span>
<span class="s0">tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He</span>
<span class="s0">visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by</span>
<span class="s0">him to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tutolmin. Then,</span>
<span class="s0">as Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in</span>
<span class="s0">forged Russian money which he had prepared: &quot;Raising the use of</span>
<span class="s0">these means by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let</span>
<span class="s0">relief be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food</span>
<span class="s0">was too precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part</span>
<span class="s0">enemies, Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to</span>
<span class="s0">purchase food from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being</span>
<span class="s0">issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military</span>
<span class="s0">duties and to suppress robbery.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans--which</span>
<span class="s0">were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances--did</span>
<span class="s0">not affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock</span>
<span class="s0">detached from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless</span>
<span class="s0">way without engaging the cogwheels.</span>

<span class="s0">With reference to the military side--the plan of campaign--that work</span>
<span class="s0">of genius of which Thiers remarks that, &quot;His genius never devised</span>
<span class="s0">anything more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">enters into a polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius</span>
<span class="s0">must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October-</span>
<span class="s0">that plan never was or could be executed, for it was quite out of</span>
<span class="s0">touch with the facts of the case. The fortifying of the Kremlin, for</span>
<span class="s0">which la Mosquee (as Napoleon termed the church of Basil the</span>
<span class="s0">Beatified) was to have been razed to the ground, proved quite useless.</span>
<span class="s0">The mining of the Kremlin only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">wish that it should be blown up when he left Moscow--as a child</span>
<span class="s0">wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit</span>
<span class="s0">of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so concerned, produced</span>
<span class="s0">an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch with the</span>
<span class="s0">Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it was</span>
<span class="s0">only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skill--and apparently</span>
<span class="s0">the genius--of Murat.</span>

<span class="s0">With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's arguments as to his</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimity and justice, both to Tutolmin and to Yakovlev (whose chief</span>
<span class="s0">concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;</span>
<span class="s0">Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their</span>
<span class="s0">embassage.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed</span>
<span class="s0">incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a</span>
<span class="s0">municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain</span>
<span class="s0">people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of</span>
<span class="s0">preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from</span>
<span class="s0">being looted.</span>

<span class="s0">With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so</span>
<span class="s0">easily been settled by Napoleon's visit to a mosque, no results were</span>
<span class="s0">achieved. Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to</span>
<span class="s0">carry out Napoleon's wish, but one of them was slapped in the face</span>
<span class="s0">by a French soldier while conducting service, and a French official</span>
<span class="s0">reported of another that: &quot;The priest whom I found and invited to</span>
<span class="s0">say Mass cleaned and locked up the church. That night the doors were</span>
<span class="s0">again broken open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and</span>
<span class="s0">other disorders perpetrated.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious</span>
<span class="s0">workmen and to peasants evoked no response. There were no</span>
<span class="s0">industrious workmen, and the peasants caught the commissaries who</span>
<span class="s0">ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them.</span>

<span class="s0">As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the</span>
<span class="s0">troops, these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in</span>
<span class="s0">the Kremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed again at once because</span>
<span class="s0">the actors and actresses were robbed.</span>

<span class="s0">Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as</span>
<span class="s0">well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The</span>
<span class="s0">French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the</span>
<span class="s0">paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to</span>
<span class="s0">the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.</span>

<span class="s0">But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders</span>
<span class="s0">given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon's attempt to stop</span>
<span class="s0">the looting and re-establish discipline.</span>

<span class="s0">This is what the army authorities were reporting:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order</span>
<span class="s0">is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade</span>
<span class="s0">in a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they</span>
<span class="s0">sell stolen goods.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of</span>
<span class="s0">the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate</span>
<span class="s0">inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have</span>
<span class="s0">the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly</span>
<span class="s0">witnessed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging-</span>
<span class="s0">October 9.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our</span>
<span class="s0">district who ought to be arrested by a strong force--October 11.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict</span>
<span class="s0">orders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually</span>
<span class="s0">seen returning to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and</span>
<span class="s0">pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening,</span>
<span class="s0">last night, and today. The Emperor sees with regret that the picked</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers appointed to guard his person, who should set an example of</span>
<span class="s0">discipline, carry disobedience to such a point that they break into</span>
<span class="s0">the cellars and stores containing army supplies. Others have disgraced</span>
<span class="s0">themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers, and</span>
<span class="s0">have abused and beaten them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Grand Marshal of the palace,&quot; wrote the governor, &quot;complains</span>
<span class="s0">bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to</span>
<span class="s0">commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows</span>
<span class="s0">of the Emperor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot</span>
<span class="s0">the provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated</span>
<span class="s0">and perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it</span>
<span class="s0">did not go away.</span>

<span class="s0">It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused</span>
<span class="s0">by the capture of transport trains on the Smolensk road, and by the</span>
<span class="s0">battle of Tarutino. The news of that battle of Tarutino,</span>
<span class="s0">unexpectedly received by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a</span>
<span class="s0">desire to punish the Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the order</span>
<span class="s0">for departure which the whole army was demanding.</span>

<span class="s0">Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they</span>
<span class="s0">had stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal tresor, but</span>
<span class="s0">on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers</span>
<span class="s0">says) horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not</span>
<span class="s0">order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with</span>
<span class="s0">those of a certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the</span>
<span class="s0">caleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that</span>
<span class="s0">it was a very good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry</span>
<span class="s0">provisions, the sick, and the wounded.</span>

<span class="s0">The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal</span>
<span class="s0">which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To</span>
<span class="s0">study the skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from</span>
<span class="s0">the time it entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying</span>
<span class="s0">the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very</span>
<span class="s0">often a wounded animal, hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the</span>
<span class="s0">hunter's gun, runs forward and back again, and hastens its own end.</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon, under pressure from his whole army, did the same thing.</span>
<span class="s0">The rustle of the battle of Tarutino frightened the beast, and it</span>
<span class="s0">rushed forward onto the hunter's gun, reached him, turned back, and</span>
<span class="s0">finally--like any wild beast--ran back along the most</span>
<span class="s0">disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was familiar.</span>

<span class="s0">During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have</span>
<span class="s0">been the leader of all these movements--as the figurehead of a ship</span>
<span class="s0">may seem to a savage to guide the vessel--acted like a child who,</span>
<span class="s0">holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving</span>
<span class="s0">it.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of</span>
<span class="s0">the shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little</span>
<span class="s0">blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped</span>
<span class="s0">about him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev at night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but</span>
<span class="s0">always returned again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it</span>
<span class="s0">still belonged to nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor;</span>
<span class="s0">the soldier who told stories called it Femgalka; Karataev and others</span>
<span class="s0">called it Gray, or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name,</span>
<span class="s0">or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the</span>
<span class="s0">blue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round</span>
<span class="s0">as a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that it would often</span>
<span class="s0">gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three</span>
<span class="s0">legs, as if disdaining to use all four. Everything pleased it. Now</span>
<span class="s0">it would roll on its back, yelping with delight, now bask in the sun</span>
<span class="s0">with a thoughtful air of importance, and now frolic about playing with</span>
<span class="s0">a chip of wood or a straw.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only</span>
<span class="s0">remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier's trousers which by</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev's advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and</span>
<span class="s0">a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this</span>
<span class="s0">time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of</span>
<span class="s0">solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache</span>
<span class="s0">covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested</span>
<span class="s0">with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes</span>
<span class="s0">was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The</span>
<span class="s0">former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now</span>
<span class="s0">replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet</span>
<span class="s0">were bare.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and</span>
<span class="s0">horsemen were passing that morning, then into the distance across</span>
<span class="s0">the river, then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about</span>
<span class="s0">biting him, and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in</span>
<span class="s0">various positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he</span>
<span class="s0">looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction</span>
<span class="s0">flitted across his face. The sight of them reminded him of all he</span>
<span class="s0">had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection</span>
<span class="s0">was pleasant to him.</span>

<span class="s0">For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts</span>
<span class="s0">in the mornings--what is called an &quot;old wives' summer.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly</span>
<span class="s0">pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in</span>
<span class="s0">the air.</span>

<span class="s0">On everything--far and near--lay the magic crystal glitter seen only</span>
<span class="s0">at that time autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,</span>
<span class="s0">with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare</span>
<span class="s0">trees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green</span>
<span class="s0">church spire, and the corners of the white house in the distance,</span>
<span class="s0">all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with</span>
<span class="s0">unnatural clearness. Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a</span>
<span class="s0">half-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still</span>
<span class="s0">showing dark green beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled</span>
<span class="s0">house--which in dull weather was repulsively ugly--seemed quietly</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful now, in the clear, motionless brilliance.</span>

<span class="s0">A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a</span>
<span class="s0">skullcap on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from</span>
<span class="s0">behind a corner of the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly</span>
<span class="s0">wink.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!&quot; (Their name for Pierre.) &quot;Eh?</span>
<span class="s0">Just like spring!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his</span>
<span class="s0">pipe, though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To be on the march in such weather...&quot; he began.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the</span>
<span class="s0">corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there</span>
<span class="s0">ought to be an order about the prisoners that day. Sokolov, one of the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers in the shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the</span>
<span class="s0">corporal that something should be done about him. The corporal replied</span>
<span class="s0">that Pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a</span>
<span class="s0">permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick, and</span>
<span class="s0">that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by</span>
<span class="s0">the authorities.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the</span>
<span class="s0">captain, you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to</span>
<span class="s0">the captain when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre and showed him all sorts of favors.)</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the other day. 'Monsieur Kiril</span>
<span class="s0">is a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who</span>
<span class="s0">has had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what's what.... If he</span>
<span class="s0">wants anything and asks me, he won't get a refusal. When one has</span>
<span class="s0">studied, you see, one likes education and well-bred people.' It is for</span>
<span class="s0">your sake I mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not</span>
<span class="s0">been for you that affair would have ended ill.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The</span>
<span class="s0">affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before--a fight</span>
<span class="s0">between the prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had</span>
<span class="s0">succeeded in pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had</span>
<span class="s0">heard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman had said. While Pierre was repeating what he had been told</span>
<span class="s0">about the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier</span>
<span class="s0">came up to the door of the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his</span>
<span class="s0">fingers to his forehead by way of greeting, he asked Pierre whether</span>
<span class="s0">the soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that</span>
<span class="s0">shed.</span>

<span class="s0">A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to</span>
<span class="s0">them, which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into</span>
<span class="s0">boots and shirts for them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ready, ready, dear fellow!&quot; said Karataev, coming out with a neatly</span>
<span class="s0">folded shirt.</span>

<span class="s0">Karataev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at</span>
<span class="s0">work, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot.</span>
<span class="s0">His hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree</span>
<span class="s0">bast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here</span>
<span class="s0">it is, ready,&quot; said Platon, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had</span>
<span class="s0">sewn.</span>

<span class="s0">The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his</span>
<span class="s0">hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had</span>
<span class="s0">a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin</span>
<span class="s0">bare body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking</span>
<span class="s0">on would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly.</span>
<span class="s0">None of the prisoners said a word.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;See, it fits well!&quot; Platon kept repeating, pulling the shirt</span>
<span class="s0">straight.</span>

<span class="s0">The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without</span>
<span class="s0">raising his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper</span>
<span class="s0">tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Platon with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his</span>
<span class="s0">work.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's good, quite good, thank you,&quot; said the Frenchman, in French,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;but there must be some linen left over.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It will fit better still when it sets to your body,&quot; said Karataev,</span>
<span class="s0">still admiring his handiwork. &quot;You'll be nice and comfortable....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note</span>
<span class="s0">and gave it to Karataev. &quot;But give me the pieces that are over.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre saw that Platon did not want to understand what the Frenchman</span>
<span class="s0">was saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karataev thanked the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over</span>
<span class="s0">and asked Pierre to translate what he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What does he want the bits for?&quot; said Karataev. &quot;They'd make fine</span>
<span class="s0">leg bands for us. Well, never mind.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Karataev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression,</span>
<span class="s0">took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman without looking at him. &quot;Oh dear!&quot; muttered Karataev and</span>
<span class="s0">went away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment,</span>
<span class="s0">then looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre's look had told</span>
<span class="s0">him something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!&quot; And handing back the</span>
<span class="s0">odd bits he turned and went out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, look at that,&quot; said Karataev, swaying his head. &quot;People said</span>
<span class="s0">they were not Christians, but they too have souls. It's what the old</span>
<span class="s0">folk used to say: 'A sweating hand's an open hand, a dry hand's</span>
<span class="s0">close.' He's naked, but yet he's given it back.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the</span>
<span class="s0">pieces.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But they'll make grand leg bands, dear friend,&quot; he said, and went</span>
<span class="s0">back into the shed.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and</span>
<span class="s0">though the French had offered to move him from the men's to the</span>
<span class="s0">officers' shed, he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.</span>

<span class="s0">In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the</span>
<span class="s0">extreme limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his</span>
<span class="s0">physical strength and health, of which he had till then been</span>
<span class="s0">unconscious, and thanks especially to the fact that the privations</span>
<span class="s0">came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began, he</span>
<span class="s0">endured his position not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this</span>
<span class="s0">time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly</span>
<span class="s0">striven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different ways that</span>
<span class="s0">tranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so impressed him in</span>
<span class="s0">the soldiers at the battle of Borodino. He had sought it in</span>
<span class="s0">philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, in</span>
<span class="s0">wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in romantic love for</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha; he had sought it by reasoning--and all these quests and</span>
<span class="s0">experiments had failed him. And now without thinking about it he had</span>
<span class="s0">found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death,</span>
<span class="s0">through privation, and through what he recognized in Karataev.</span>

<span class="s0">Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as</span>
<span class="s0">it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the</span>
<span class="s0">agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important.</span>
<span class="s0">It did not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or</span>
<span class="s0">politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things</span>
<span class="s0">were no business of his, and that he was not called on to judge</span>
<span class="s0">concerning them and therefore could not do so. &quot;Russia and summer</span>
<span class="s0">weather are not bound together,&quot; he thought, repeating words of</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev's which he found strangely consoling. His intention of</span>
<span class="s0">killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of</span>
<span class="s0">the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even</span>
<span class="s0">ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should</span>
<span class="s0">not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What</span>
<span class="s0">concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading</span>
<span class="s0">the life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and</span>
<span class="s0">especially to him, whether or not they found out that their prisoner's</span>
<span class="s0">name was Count Bezukhov?</span>

<span class="s0">He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and</span>
<span class="s0">quite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew's thoughts</span>
<span class="s0">somewhat differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that</span>
<span class="s0">happiness could only be negative, but had said it with a shade of</span>
<span class="s0">bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire</span>
<span class="s0">for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and</span>
<span class="s0">never be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without any mental</span>
<span class="s0">reservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction of one's needs</span>
<span class="s0">and consequent freedom in the choice of one's occupation, that is,</span>
<span class="s0">of one's way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man's</span>
<span class="s0">highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he fully</span>
<span class="s0">appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking</span>
<span class="s0">when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth</span>
<span class="s0">when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk</span>
<span class="s0">and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one's needs--good food,</span>
<span class="s0">cleanliness, and freedom--now that he was deprived of all this, seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of</span>
<span class="s0">occupation, that is, of his way of life--now that that was so</span>
<span class="s0">restricted--seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a</span>
<span class="s0">superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying</span>
<span class="s0">one's needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation--such</span>
<span class="s0">freedom as his wealth, his education, and his social position had</span>
<span class="s0">given him in his own life--is just what makes the choice of occupation</span>
<span class="s0">insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">having an occupation.</span>

<span class="s0">All Pierre's daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free.</span>
<span class="s0">Yet subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke</span>
<span class="s0">with enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable,</span>
<span class="s0">strong, joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind</span>
<span class="s0">and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.</span>

<span class="s0">When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn,</span>
<span class="s0">and saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still</span>
<span class="s0">dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills,</span>
<span class="s0">and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple</span>
<span class="s0">distance, when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the</span>
<span class="s0">noise of the crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when</span>
<span class="s0">afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun's rim appeared</span>
<span class="s0">solemnly from behind a cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the</span>
<span class="s0">hoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began to sparkle in the</span>
<span class="s0">glad light--Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he</span>
<span class="s0">had never before known. And this not only stayed with him during the</span>
<span class="s0">whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in strength as the</span>
<span class="s0">hardships of his position increased.</span>

<span class="s0">That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still</span>
<span class="s0">further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners</span>
<span class="s0">formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge</span>
<span class="s0">of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his</span>
<span class="s0">readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance</span>
<span class="s0">of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which</span>
<span class="s0">he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut;</span>
<span class="s0">his gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still</span>
<span class="s0">and thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them</span>
<span class="s0">incomprehensible), he appeared to them a rather mysterious and</span>
<span class="s0">superior being. The very qualities that had been a hindrance, if not</span>
<span class="s0">actually harmful, to him in the world he had lived in--his strength,</span>
<span class="s0">his disdain for the comforts of life, his absent-mindedness and</span>
<span class="s0">simplicity--here among these people gave him almost the status of a</span>
<span class="s0">hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities</span>
<span class="s0">upon him.</span>




<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and</span>
<span class="s0">seventh of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts</span>
<span class="s0">loaded, and troops and baggage trains started.</span>

<span class="s0">At seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing</span>
<span class="s0">shakos and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in</span>
<span class="s0">front of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses</span>
<span class="s0">sounded all along the lines.</span>

<span class="s0">In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only</span>
<span class="s0">awaited the order to start. The sick soldier, Sokolov, pale and thin</span>
<span class="s0">with dark shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot</span>
<span class="s0">and not dressed. His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his</span>
<span class="s0">face, gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention</span>
<span class="s0">to him, and he moaned regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so</span>
<span class="s0">much his sufferings that caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as</span>
<span class="s0">his fear and grief at being left alone.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev had made for him from some leather a French soldier had</span>
<span class="s0">torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with, went</span>
<span class="s0">up to the sick man and squatted down beside him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You know, Sokolov, they are not all going away! They have a</span>
<span class="s0">hospital here. You may be better off than we others,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!&quot; moaned the man</span>
<span class="s0">in a louder voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll go and ask them again directly,&quot; said Pierre, rising and going</span>
<span class="s0">to the door of the shed.</span>

<span class="s0">Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him</span>
<span class="s0">a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal</span>
<span class="s0">and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had</span>
<span class="s0">metal straps, and these changed their familiar faces.</span>

<span class="s0">The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners had to be counted before being let out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?...&quot; Pierre began.</span>

<span class="s0">But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal</span>
<span class="s0">he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that</span>
<span class="s0">moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of</span>
<span class="s0">drums was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door.</span>
<span class="s0">The shed became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two</span>
<span class="s0">sides drowned the sick man's groans.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There it is!... It again!...&quot; said Pierre to himself, and an</span>
<span class="s0">involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal's changed</span>
<span class="s0">face, in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise</span>
<span class="s0">of the drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which</span>
<span class="s0">compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men--that</span>
<span class="s0">force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions. To</span>
<span class="s0">fear or to try to escape that force, to address entreaties or</span>
<span class="s0">exhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">knew this now. One had to wait and endure. He did not again go to</span>
<span class="s0">the sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frowning by the</span>
<span class="s0">door of the hut.</span>

<span class="s0">When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one</span>
<span class="s0">another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed</span>
<span class="s0">his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal</span>
<span class="s0">had assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also</span>
<span class="s0">in marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre had recognized in the corporal's words and in the roll of the</span>
<span class="s0">drums.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pass on, pass on!&quot; the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and</span>
<span class="s0">looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What now?&quot; the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre told him about the sick man.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He'll manage to walk, devil take him!&quot; said the captain. &quot;Pass</span>
<span class="s0">on, pass on!&quot; he continued without looking at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But he is dying,&quot; Pierre again began.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Be so good...&quot; shouted the captain, frowning angrily.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...&quot; rattled the drums, and Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these</span>
<span class="s0">men and that it was now useless to say any more.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to</span>
<span class="s0">march in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among</span>
<span class="s0">them, and about three hundred men.</span>

<span class="s0">The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all</span>
<span class="s0">strangers to Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at</span>
<span class="s0">him and at his shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him</span>
<span class="s0">walked a fat major with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing</span>
<span class="s0">a Kazan dressing grown tied round with a towel, and who evidently</span>
<span class="s0">enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in</span>
<span class="s0">which he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing</span>
<span class="s0">gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other. Panting</span>
<span class="s0">and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he</span>
<span class="s0">thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when</span>
<span class="s0">they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something</span>
<span class="s0">when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little</span>
<span class="s0">officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now</span>
<span class="s0">being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt</span>
<span class="s0">boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side</span>
<span class="s0">and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations</span>
<span class="s0">as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city</span>
<span class="s0">was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a</span>
<span class="s0">Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was</span>
<span class="s0">mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you disputing about?&quot; said the major angrily. &quot;What does</span>
<span class="s0">it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it's</span>
<span class="s0">burned down, and there's an end of it.... What are you pushing for?</span>
<span class="s0">Isn't the road wide enough?&quot; said he, turning to a man behind him</span>
<span class="s0">who was not pushing him at all.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?&quot; the prisoners on one side and</span>
<span class="s0">another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. &quot;All</span>
<span class="s0">beyond the river, and Zubova, and in the Kremlin.... Just look!</span>
<span class="s0">There's not half of it left. Yes, I told you--the whole quarter beyond</span>
<span class="s0">the river, and so it is.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you know it's burned, so what's the use of talking?&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">major.</span>

<span class="s0">As they passed near a church in the Khamovniki (one of the few</span>
<span class="s0">unburned quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And</span>
<span class="s0">smeared with something!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked</span>
<span class="s0">these exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the</span>
<span class="s0">palings surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw</span>
<span class="s0">better than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set</span>
<span class="s0">upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...&quot; the</span>
<span class="s0">convoy guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh</span>
<span class="s0">virulence, drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who</span>
<span class="s0">were gazing at the dead man.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">Through the cross streets of the Khamovniki quarter the prisoners</span>
<span class="s0">marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons</span>
<span class="s0">belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they</span>
<span class="s0">came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with</span>
<span class="s0">private vehicles.</span>

<span class="s0">At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get</span>
<span class="s0">across. From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving</span>
<span class="s0">baggage trains before and behind them. To the right, where the</span>
<span class="s0">Kaluga road turns near Neskuchny, endless rows of troops and carts</span>
<span class="s0">stretched away into the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais'</span>
<span class="s0">corps which had started before any of the others. Behind, along the</span>
<span class="s0">riverside and across the Stone Bridge, were Ney's troops and</span>
<span class="s0">transport.</span>

<span class="s0">Davout's troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing</span>
<span class="s0">the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kaluga</span>
<span class="s0">road. But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of</span>
<span class="s0">Beauharnais' train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the</span>
<span class="s0">Kaluga road when the vanguard of Ney's army was already emerging</span>
<span class="s0">from the Great Ordynka Street.</span>

<span class="s0">When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few</span>
<span class="s0">steps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles</span>
<span class="s0">and men crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few</span>
<span class="s0">hundred paces that separated the bridge from the Kaluga road, taking</span>
<span class="s0">more than an hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the</span>
<span class="s0">streets of the Transmoskva ward and the Kaluga road converge, and</span>
<span class="s0">the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at</span>
<span class="s0">that crossway. From all sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard</span>
<span class="s0">the rattle of wheels, the tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger</span>
<span class="s0">and abuse. Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house,</span>
<span class="s0">listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll</span>
<span class="s0">of the drums.</span>

<span class="s0">To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the</span>
<span class="s0">wall of the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They've loaded goods</span>
<span class="s0">even on the cannon! Look there, those are furs!&quot; they exclaimed. &quot;Just</span>
<span class="s0">see what the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one</span>
<span class="s0">has behind in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some</span>
<span class="s0">icons, by heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has</span>
<span class="s0">loaded himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they've even grabbed</span>
<span class="s0">those chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks....</span>
<span class="s0">Heavens! They're fighting.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's right, hit him on the snout--on his snout! Like this, we</span>
<span class="s0">shan't get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown!</span>
<span class="s0">It's like a portable house.... That fellow's dropped his sack and</span>
<span class="s0">doesn't see it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not</span>
<span class="s0">bad-looking either! Yes, I dare say, that's the way they'll let you</span>
<span class="s0">pass... Just look, there's no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven,</span>
<span class="s0">so they are! In carriages--see how comfortably they've settled</span>
<span class="s0">themselves!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again, as at the church in Khamovniki, a wave of general curiosity</span>
<span class="s0">bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to</span>
<span class="s0">his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted</span>
<span class="s0">their curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts,</span>
<span class="s0">closely squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in</span>
<span class="s0">glaring colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.</span>

<span class="s0">From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the</span>
<span class="s0">mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful:</span>
<span class="s0">neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women</span>
<span class="s0">hurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now</span>
<span class="s0">witnessed scarcely made an impression on him--as if his soul, making</span>
<span class="s0">ready for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might</span>
<span class="s0">weaken it.</span>

<span class="s0">The women's vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts,</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers,</span>
<span class="s0">ammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.</span>

<span class="s0">All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some</span>
<span class="s0">invisible power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came</span>
<span class="s0">flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get</span>
<span class="s0">on quickly; they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to</span>
<span class="s0">fight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of</span>
<span class="s0">abuse flew from side to side, and all the faces bore the same</span>
<span class="s0">swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre that morning on the corporal's face when the drums were</span>
<span class="s0">beating.</span>

<span class="s0">It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the</span>
<span class="s0">escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way</span>
<span class="s0">in among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all</span>
<span class="s0">sides, emerged onto the Kaluga road.</span>

<span class="s0">They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the</span>
<span class="s0">sun began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men</span>
<span class="s0">began to prepare for their night's rest. They all appeared angry and</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could</span>
<span class="s0">be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran</span>
<span class="s0">into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole.</span>
<span class="s0">Several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat</span>
<span class="s0">the carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others</span>
<span class="s0">fought among themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly</span>
<span class="s0">wounded on the head by a sword.</span>

<span class="s0">It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid</span>
<span class="s0">fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and</span>
<span class="s0">the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and</span>
<span class="s0">eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start. Once at a</span>
<span class="s0">standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know</span>
<span class="s0">where they were going, and that much that was painful and difficult</span>
<span class="s0">awaited them on this journey.</span>

<span class="s0">During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than</span>
<span class="s0">they had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the</span>
<span class="s0">first time received horseflesh for their meat ration.</span>

<span class="s0">From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what</span>
<span class="s0">seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners, in</span>
<span class="s0">unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations.</span>

<span class="s0">This spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one</span>
<span class="s0">Russian soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had</span>
<span class="s0">escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for</span>
<span class="s0">straying too far from the road, and heard his friend the captain</span>
<span class="s0">reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on</span>
<span class="s0">account of the escape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned officer's</span>
<span class="s0">excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk, the officer</span>
<span class="s0">replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the</span>
<span class="s0">executions, but which he had not felt during his imprisonment, now</span>
<span class="s0">again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt that in</span>
<span class="s0">proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him, there grew</span>
<span class="s0">and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it.</span>

<span class="s0">He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with</span>
<span class="s0">his comrades.</span>

<span class="s0">Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen</span>
<span class="s0">in Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of</span>
<span class="s0">the order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in</span>
<span class="s0">reaction against the worsening of their position they were all</span>
<span class="s0">particularly animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences,</span>
<span class="s0">of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and</span>
<span class="s0">avoided all talk of their present situation.</span>

<span class="s0">The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in</span>
<span class="s0">the sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon</span>
<span class="s0">from the rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely</span>
<span class="s0">in the gray haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night</span>
<span class="s0">had not yet come. Pierre got up and left his new companions,</span>
<span class="s0">crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where</span>
<span class="s0">he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed. He</span>
<span class="s0">wanted to talk to them. On the road he was stopped by a French</span>
<span class="s0">sentinel who ordered him back.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an</span>
<span class="s0">unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him</span>
<span class="s0">and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of</span>
<span class="s0">the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought.</span>
<span class="s0">Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured</span>
<span class="s0">laughter, so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise</span>
<span class="s0">to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ha-ha-ha!&quot; laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: &quot;The</span>
<span class="s0">soldier did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me</span>
<span class="s0">captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">he laughed till tears started to his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing</span>
<span class="s0">at all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther</span>
<span class="s0">away from the inquisitive man, and looked around him.</span>

<span class="s0">The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the</span>
<span class="s0">crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the</span>
<span class="s0">red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the</span>
<span class="s0">light sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp,</span>
<span class="s0">unseen before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still,</span>
<span class="s0">beyond those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless</span>
<span class="s0">distance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the</span>
<span class="s0">twinkling stars in its faraway depths. &quot;And all that is me, all that</span>
<span class="s0">is within me, and it is all I!&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;And they caught all</span>
<span class="s0">that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks!&quot; He smiled, and</span>
<span class="s0">went and lay down to sleep beside his companions.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutuzov with a</span>
<span class="s0">letter from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">though Napoleon was already not far from Kutuzov on the old Kaluga</span>
<span class="s0">road. Kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one</span>
<span class="s0">formerly brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no</span>
<span class="s0">question of peace.</span>

<span class="s0">Soon after that a report was received from Dorokhov's guerrilla</span>
<span class="s0">detachment operating to the left of Tarutino that troops of</span>
<span class="s0">Broussier's division had been seen at Forminsk and that being</span>
<span class="s0">separated from the rest of the French army they might easily be</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed. The soldiers and officers again demanded action. Generals</span>
<span class="s0">on the staff, excited by the memory of the easy victory at Tarutino,</span>
<span class="s0">urged Kutuzov to carry out Dorokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov did not</span>
<span class="s0">consider any offensive necessary. The result was a compromise which</span>
<span class="s0">was inevitable: a small detachment was sent to Forminsk to attack</span>
<span class="s0">Broussier.</span>

<span class="s0">By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most</span>
<span class="s0">difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhturov--that same</span>
<span class="s0">modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing</span>
<span class="s0">up plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering</span>
<span class="s0">crosses on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was</span>
<span class="s0">spoken of as undecided and undiscerning--but whom we find commanding</span>
<span class="s0">wherever the position was most difficult all through the</span>
<span class="s0">Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he</span>
<span class="s0">remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what</span>
<span class="s0">was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single</span>
<span class="s0">general was left in the rear guard. Ill with fever he went to Smolensk</span>
<span class="s0">with twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon's whole</span>
<span class="s0">army. In Smolensk, at the Malakhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in</span>
<span class="s0">a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the</span>
<span class="s0">town--and Smolensk held out all day long. At the battle of Borodino,</span>
<span class="s0">when Bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank</span>
<span class="s0">had fallen and the full force of the French artillery fire was</span>
<span class="s0">directed against it, the man sent there was this same irresolute and</span>
<span class="s0">undiscerning Dokhturov--Kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he</span>
<span class="s0">had made by sending someone else there first. And the quiet little</span>
<span class="s0">Dokhturov rode thither, and Borodino became the greatest glory of</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to us in verse and</span>
<span class="s0">prose, but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said.</span>

<span class="s0">It was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from there</span>
<span class="s0">to Malo-Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle with the French</span>
<span class="s0">was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army</span>
<span class="s0">began; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of</span>
<span class="s0">the campaign, but of Dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that</span>
<span class="s0">dubiously. And this silence about Dokhturov is the clearest</span>
<span class="s0">testimony to his merit.</span>

<span class="s0">It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a</span>
<span class="s0">machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance</span>
<span class="s0">and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most</span>
<span class="s0">important part. The man who does not understand the construction of</span>
<span class="s0">the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which</span>
<span class="s0">revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine,</span>
<span class="s0">and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.</span>

<span class="s0">On the tenth of October when Dokhturov had gone halfway to</span>
<span class="s0">Forminsk and stopped at the village of Aristovo, preparing</span>
<span class="s0">faithfully to execute the orders he had received, the whole French</span>
<span class="s0">army having, in its convulsive movement, reached Murat's position</span>
<span class="s0">apparently in order to give battle--suddenly without any reason turned</span>
<span class="s0">off to the left onto the new Kaluga road and began to enter</span>
<span class="s0">Forminsk, where only Broussier had been till then. At that time</span>
<span class="s0">Dokhturov had under his command, besides Dorokhov's detachment, the</span>
<span class="s0">two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslavin.</span>

<span class="s0">On the evening of October 11 Seslavin came to the Aristovo</span>
<span class="s0">headquarters with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner</span>
<span class="s0">said that the troops that had entered Forminsk that day were the</span>
<span class="s0">vanguard of the whole army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army</span>
<span class="s0">had left Moscow four days previously. That same evening a house serf</span>
<span class="s0">who had come from Borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering</span>
<span class="s0">the town. Some Cossacks of Dokhturov's detachment reported having</span>
<span class="s0">sighted the French Guards marching along the road to Borovsk. From all</span>
<span class="s0">these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a</span>
<span class="s0">single division there was now the whole French army marching from</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow in an unexpected direction--along the Kaluga road. Dokhturov</span>
<span class="s0">was unwilling to undertake any action, as it was not clear to him</span>
<span class="s0">now what he ought to do. He had been ordered to attack Forminsk. But</span>
<span class="s0">only Broussier had been there at that time and now the whole French</span>
<span class="s0">army was there. Ermolov wished to act on his own judgment, but</span>
<span class="s0">Dokhturov insisted that he must have Kutuzov's instructions. So it was</span>
<span class="s0">decided to send a dispatch to the staff.</span>

<span class="s0">For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovitinov, was chosen, who</span>
<span class="s0">was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering a</span>
<span class="s0">written report. Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov, having received the</span>
<span class="s0">dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff</span>
<span class="s0">accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four</span>
<span class="s0">days. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour</span>
<span class="s0">and a half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka</span>
<span class="s0">after one o'clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle</span>
<span class="s0">fence hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he</span>
<span class="s0">entered a dark passage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The general on duty, quick! It's very important!&quot; said he to</span>
<span class="s0">someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third</span>
<span class="s0">night he has not slept,&quot; said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;You should wake the captain first.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But this is very important, from General Dokhturov,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Bolkhovitinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in</span>
<span class="s0">the dark.</span>

<span class="s0">The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your honor, your honor! A courier.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What? What's that? From whom?&quot; came a sleepy voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich. Napoleon is at Forminsk,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Bolkhovitinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but</span>
<span class="s0">guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn.</span>

<span class="s0">The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't like waking him,&quot; he said, fumbling for something. &quot;He is</span>
<span class="s0">very ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here is the dispatch,&quot; said Bolkhovitinov. &quot;My orders are to give</span>
<span class="s0">it at once to the general on duty.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wait a moment, I'll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you</span>
<span class="s0">always hide it?&quot; said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,</span>
<span class="s0">to the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, Konovnitsyn's adjutant.)</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I've found it, I've found it!&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was fumbling for</span>
<span class="s0">something on the candlestick.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, the nasty beasts!&quot; said he with disgust.</span>

<span class="s0">By the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw Shcherbinin's</span>
<span class="s0">youthful face as he held the candle, and the face of another man who</span>
<span class="s0">was still asleep. This was Konovnitsyn.</span>

<span class="s0">When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned</span>
<span class="s0">up, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, from</span>
<span class="s0">the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were</span>
<span class="s0">running away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovitinov was</span>
<span class="s0">bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it</span>
<span class="s0">with his sleeve.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who gave the report?&quot; inquired Shcherbinin, taking the envelope.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The news is reliable,&quot; said Bolkhovitinov. &quot;Prisoners, Cossacks,</span>
<span class="s0">and the scouts all say the same thing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There's nothing to be done, we'll have to wake him,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Shcherbinin, rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay</span>
<span class="s0">covered by a greatcoat. &quot;Peter Petrovich!&quot; said he. (Konovnitsyn did</span>
<span class="s0">not stir.) &quot;To the General Staff!&quot; he said with a smile, knowing</span>
<span class="s0">that those words would be sure to arouse him.</span>

<span class="s0">And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On</span>
<span class="s0">Konovnitsyn's handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,</span>
<span class="s0">there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote</span>
<span class="s0">from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face</span>
<span class="s0">assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what is it? From whom?&quot; he asked immediately but without</span>
<span class="s0">hurry, blinking at the light.</span>

<span class="s0">While listening to the officer's report Konovnitsyn broke the seal</span>
<span class="s0">and read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his</span>
<span class="s0">legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began</span>
<span class="s0">putting on his boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair</span>
<span class="s0">over his temples, and donned his cap.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of</span>
<span class="s0">great importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or</span>
<span class="s0">ask himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest</span>
<span class="s0">him. He regarded the whole business of the war not with his</span>
<span class="s0">intelligence or his reason but by something else. There was within him</span>
<span class="s0">a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well, but that one</span>
<span class="s0">must not trust to this and still less speak about it, but must only</span>
<span class="s0">attend to one's own work. And he did his work, giving his whole</span>
<span class="s0">strength to the task.</span>

<span class="s0">Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn, like Dokhturov, seems to have been</span>
<span class="s0">included merely for propriety's sake in the list of the so-called</span>
<span class="s0">heroes of 1812--the Barclays, Raevskis, Ermolovs, Platovs, and</span>
<span class="s0">Miloradoviches. Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of</span>
<span class="s0">very limited capacity and information, and like Dokhturov he never</span>
<span class="s0">made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most</span>
<span class="s0">difficult. Since his appointment as general on duty he had always</span>
<span class="s0">slept with his door open, giving orders that every messenger should be</span>
<span class="s0">allowed to wake him up. In battle he was always under fire, so that</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front, and</span>
<span class="s0">like Dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that, without</span>
<span class="s0">clatter or noise, constitute the most essential part of the machine.</span>

<span class="s0">Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnitsyn frowned-</span>
<span class="s0">partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant</span>
<span class="s0">thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of influential</span>
<span class="s0">men on the staff would be stirred up by this news, especially</span>
<span class="s0">Bennigsen, who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers drawn with</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue orders,</span>
<span class="s0">and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him</span>
<span class="s0">though he knew it could not be helped.</span>

<span class="s0">And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news,</span>
<span class="s0">immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his</span>
<span class="s0">quarters, until Konovnitsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded</span>
<span class="s0">him that they must go to see his Highness.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often</span>
<span class="s0">fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his</span>
<span class="s0">bed without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.</span>

<span class="s0">So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred</span>
<span class="s0">head on his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and</span>
<span class="s0">peering into the darkness.</span>

<span class="s0">Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more</span>
<span class="s0">influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him,</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his</span>
<span class="s0">troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The</span>
<span class="s0">lesson of the Tarutino battle and of the day before it, which</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov remembered with pain, must, he thought, have some effect on</span>
<span class="s0">others too.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.</span>
<span class="s0">Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,&quot; thought Kutuzov.</span>
<span class="s0">He knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will</span>
<span class="s0">fall of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled,</span>
<span class="s0">the tree is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an</span>
<span class="s0">experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded, and</span>
<span class="s0">wounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it,</span>
<span class="s0">but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided</span>
<span class="s0">question. Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barthelemi having been</span>
<span class="s0">sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kutuzov was almost sure</span>
<span class="s0">that the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs and it was</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to wait.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall</span>
<span class="s0">see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!&quot; thought he. &quot;What</span>
<span class="s0">for? Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are</span>
<span class="s0">like children from whom one can't get any sensible account of what has</span>
<span class="s0">happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But</span>
<span class="s0">that's not what is needed now.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to</span>
<span class="s0">them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies&quot; (he</span>
<span class="s0">remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) &quot;they have</span>
<span class="s0">foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodino</span>
<span class="s0">was mortal or not had hung over Kutuzov's head for a whole month. On</span>
<span class="s0">the one hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutuzov felt</span>
<span class="s0">assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and</span>
<span class="s0">all the Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal.</span>
<span class="s0">But in any case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for</span>
<span class="s0">them and grew more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed</span>
<span class="s0">during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those</span>
<span class="s0">younger generals for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible</span>
<span class="s0">contingencies, just like the younger men, but with this difference,</span>
<span class="s0">that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and</span>
<span class="s0">based nothing on them. The longer he thought the more contingencies</span>
<span class="s0">presented themselves. He imagined all sorts of movements of the</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleonic army as a whole or in sections--against Petersburg, or</span>
<span class="s0">against him, or to outflank him. He thought too of the possibility</span>
<span class="s0">(which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his</span>
<span class="s0">own weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutuzov even imagined</span>
<span class="s0">that Napoleon's army might turn back through Medyn and Yukhnov, but</span>
<span class="s0">the one thing he could not foresee was what happened--the insane,</span>
<span class="s0">convulsive stampede of Napoleon's army during its first eleven days</span>
<span class="s0">after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">had not yet even dared to think of--the complete extermination of</span>
<span class="s0">the French. Dorokhov's report about Broussier's division, the</span>
<span class="s0">guerrillas' reports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors of</span>
<span class="s0">preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that</span>
<span class="s0">the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were</span>
<span class="s0">only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not</span>
<span class="s0">to Kutuzov. With his sixty years' experience he knew what value to</span>
<span class="s0">attach to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group</span>
<span class="s0">all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew</span>
<span class="s0">how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary.</span>
<span class="s0">And the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe</span>
<span class="s0">it. This question absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to</span>
<span class="s0">him only life's customary routine. To such customary routine</span>
<span class="s0">belonged his conversations with the staff, the letters he wrote from</span>
<span class="s0">Tarutino to Madame de Stael, the reading of novels, the distribution</span>
<span class="s0">of awards, his correspondence with Petersburg, and so on. But the</span>
<span class="s0">destruction of the French, which he alone foresaw, was his heart's one</span>
<span class="s0">desire.</span>

<span class="s0">On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm</span>
<span class="s0">and thinking of that.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,</span>
<span class="s0">Konovnitsyn, and Bolkhovitinov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, who's there? Come in, come in! What news?&quot; the field marshal</span>
<span class="s0">called out to them.</span>

<span class="s0">While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the</span>
<span class="s0">substance of the news.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who brought it?&quot; asked Kutuzov with a look which, when the candle</span>
<span class="s0">was lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There can be no doubt about it, your Highness.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Call him in, call him here.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big</span>
<span class="s0">paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him. He</span>
<span class="s0">screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more</span>
<span class="s0">carefully, as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his</span>
<span class="s0">own mind.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tell me, tell me, friend,&quot; said he to Bolkhovitinov in his low,</span>
<span class="s0">aged voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his</span>
<span class="s0">chest, &quot;come nearer--nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he</span>
<span class="s0">had been told to report.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Speak quicker, quicker! Don't torture me!&quot; Kutuzov interrupted him.</span>

<span class="s0">Bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting</span>
<span class="s0">instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">checked him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered</span>
<span class="s0">and wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side</span>
<span class="s0">of the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...&quot; said he in a</span>
<span class="s0">tremulous voice with folded hands. &quot;Russia is saved. I thank Thee, O</span>
<span class="s0">Lord!&quot; and he wept.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov's activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by</span>
<span class="s0">authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks, maneuvers,</span>
<span class="s0">or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokhturov went to</span>
<span class="s0">Malo-Yaroslavets, but Kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave</span>
<span class="s0">orders for the evacuation of Kaluga--a retreat beyond which town</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to him quite possible.</span>

<span class="s0">Everywhere Kutuzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for</span>
<span class="s0">his retreat fled in the opposite direction.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at</span>
<span class="s0">Tarutino and Malo-Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what would</span>
<span class="s0">have happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich</span>
<span class="s0">southern provinces.</span>

<span class="s0">But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from</span>
<span class="s0">advancing into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did</span>
<span class="s0">not bar his way), the historians forget that nothing could have</span>
<span class="s0">saved his army, for then already it bore within itself the germs of</span>
<span class="s0">inevitable ruin. How could that army--which had found abundant</span>
<span class="s0">supplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of</span>
<span class="s0">keeping them, and on arriving at Smolensk had looted provisions</span>
<span class="s0">instead of storing them--how could that army recuperate in Kaluga</span>
<span class="s0">province, which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set</span>
<span class="s0">ablaze?</span>

<span class="s0">That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodino</span>
<span class="s0">and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were,</span>
<span class="s0">the chemical elements of dissolution.</span>

<span class="s0">The members of what had once been an army--Napoleon himself and</span>
<span class="s0">all his soldiers fled--without knowing whither, each concerned only to</span>
<span class="s0">make his escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the</span>
<span class="s0">hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.</span>

<span class="s0">So it came about that at the council at Malo-Yaroslavets, when the</span>
<span class="s0">generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all</span>
<span class="s0">mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier</span>
<span class="s0">Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing</span>
<span class="s0">needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not even</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all</span>
<span class="s0">recognized.</span>

<span class="s0">But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away,</span>
<span class="s0">there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must</span>
<span class="s0">flee. An external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this</span>
<span class="s0">shock came in due time. It was what the French called &quot;le hourra de</span>
<span class="s0">l'Empereur.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode out</span>
<span class="s0">early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of</span>
<span class="s0">marshals and an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and</span>
<span class="s0">the scene of the previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks</span>
<span class="s0">on the prowl for booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly</span>
<span class="s0">captured him. If the Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what</span>
<span class="s0">saved him was the very thing that was destroying the French army,</span>
<span class="s0">the booty on which the Cossacks fell. Here as at Tarutino they went</span>
<span class="s0">after plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed</span>
<span class="s0">after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape.</span>

<span class="s0">When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">himself in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was</span>
<span class="s0">nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest,</span>
<span class="s0">familiar road. Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood</span>
<span class="s0">that hint, not feeling his former agility and boldness, and under</span>
<span class="s0">the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once</span>
<span class="s0">agreed with Mouton and issued orders--as the historians tell us--to</span>
<span class="s0">retreat by the Smolensk road.</span>

<span class="s0">That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated,</span>
<span class="s0">does not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces</span>
<span class="s0">which influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk</span>
<span class="s0">(that is, the Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on him also.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to</span>
<span class="s0">go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him</span>
<span class="s0">at the end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a</span>
<span class="s0">promised land to have the strength to move.</span>

<span class="s0">The promised land for the French during their advance had been</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, during their retreat it was their native land. But that native</span>
<span class="s0">land was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is</span>
<span class="s0">absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to</span>
<span class="s0">himself: &quot;Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I</span>
<span class="s0">shall rest and spend the night,&quot; and during the first day's journey</span>
<span class="s0">that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his</span>
<span class="s0">hopes and desires. And the impulses felt by a single person are always</span>
<span class="s0">magnified in a crowd.</span>

<span class="s0">For the French retreating along the old Smolensk road, the final</span>
<span class="s0">goal--their native land--was too remote, and their immediate goal</span>
<span class="s0">was Smolensk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously</span>
<span class="s0">intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that</span>
<span class="s0">much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolensk, nor that they</span>
<span class="s0">were told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">himself, knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this</span>
<span class="s0">alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present</span>
<span class="s0">privations. So both those who knew and those who did not know deceived</span>
<span class="s0">themselves, and pushed on to Smolensk as to a promised land.</span>

<span class="s0">Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising</span>
<span class="s0">energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on.</span>
<span class="s0">Besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French</span>
<span class="s0">into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy, there was</span>
<span class="s0">another cause binding them together--their great numbers. As with</span>
<span class="s0">the physical law of gravity, their enormous mass drew the individual</span>
<span class="s0">human atoms to itself. In their hundreds of thousands they moved</span>
<span class="s0">like a whole nation.</span>

<span class="s0">Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a</span>
<span class="s0">prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one</span>
<span class="s0">hand the force of this common attraction to Smolensk, their goal, drew</span>
<span class="s0">each of them in the same direction; on the other hand an army corps</span>
<span class="s0">could not surrender to a company, and though the French availed</span>
<span class="s0">themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to</span>
<span class="s0">surrender on the slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not</span>
<span class="s0">always occur. Their very numbers and their crowded and swift</span>
<span class="s0">movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only</span>
<span class="s0">difficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this movement, to</span>
<span class="s0">which the French were directing all their energies. Beyond a certain</span>
<span class="s0">limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of</span>
<span class="s0">decomposition.</span>

<span class="s0">A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a</span>
<span class="s0">certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt</span>
<span class="s0">the snow. On the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the</span>
<span class="s0">remaining snow becomes.</span>

<span class="s0">Of the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone understood this. When the</span>
<span class="s0">flight of the French army along the Smolensk road became well defined,</span>
<span class="s0">what Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of</span>
<span class="s0">October began to occur. The superior officers all wanted to</span>
<span class="s0">distinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to</span>
<span class="s0">overthrow the French, and all clamored for action.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited</span>
<span class="s0">in the case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.</span>

<span class="s0">He could not tell them what we say now: &quot;Why fight, why block the</span>
<span class="s0">road, losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate</span>
<span class="s0">wretches? What is the use of that, when a third of their army has</span>
<span class="s0">melted away on the road from Moscow to Vyazma without any battle?&quot; But</span>
<span class="s0">drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand, he told</span>
<span class="s0">them of the golden bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him,</span>
<span class="s0">flinging themselves on, rending and exulting over the dying beast.</span>

<span class="s0">Ermolov, Miloradovich, Platov, and others in proximity to the French</span>
<span class="s0">near Vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up</span>
<span class="s0">two French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.</span>

<span class="s0">And try as Kutuzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,</span>
<span class="s0">trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to</span>
<span class="s0">the attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost</span>
<span class="s0">thousands of men.</span>

<span class="s0">But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,</span>
<span class="s0">closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily</span>
<span class="s0">melting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smolensk.</span>






<span class="s0">BOOK FOURTEEN: 1812</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">The Battle of Borodino, with the occupation of Moscow that</span>
<span class="s0">followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is</span>
<span class="s0">one of the most instructive phenomena in history.</span>

<span class="s0">All historians agree that the external activity of states and</span>
<span class="s0">nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars,</span>
<span class="s0">and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the</span>
<span class="s0">political strength of states and nations increases or decreases.</span>

<span class="s0">Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or</span>
<span class="s0">emperor, having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his</span>
<span class="s0">enemy's army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten</span>
<span class="s0">thousand men, and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several</span>
<span class="s0">millions, all the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm</span>
<span class="s0">the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one</span>
<span class="s0">army against another is the cause, or at least an essential</span>
<span class="s0">indication, of an increase or decrease in the strength of the</span>
<span class="s0">nation--even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army-</span>
<span class="s0">a hundredth part of a nation--should oblige that whole nation to</span>
<span class="s0">submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the rights of the</span>
<span class="s0">conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated.</span>
<span class="s0">An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its rights</span>
<span class="s0">in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army</span>
<span class="s0">suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.</span>

<span class="s0">So according to history it has been found from the most ancient</span>
<span class="s0">times, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon's wars serve to</span>
<span class="s0">confirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army</span>
<span class="s0">Austria loses its rights, and the rights and the strength of France</span>
<span class="s0">increase. The victories of the French at Jena and Auerstadt destroy</span>
<span class="s0">the independent existence of Prussia.</span>

<span class="s0">But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">is taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia</span>
<span class="s0">that ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and</span>
<span class="s0">then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of</span>
<span class="s0">history: to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the</span>
<span class="s0">hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles</span>
<span class="s0">that destroyed Napoleon's army, is impossible.</span>

<span class="s0">After the French victory at Borodino there was no general engagement</span>
<span class="s0">nor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist.</span>
<span class="s0">What does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of</span>
<span class="s0">China, we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is</span>
<span class="s0">the historians' usual expedient when anything does not fit their</span>
<span class="s0">standards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which</span>
<span class="s0">only a small number of troops took part, we might treat it as an</span>
<span class="s0">exception; but this event occurred before our fathers' eyes, and for</span>
<span class="s0">them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland, and</span>
<span class="s0">it happened in the greatest of all known wars.</span>

<span class="s0">The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodino to</span>
<span class="s0">the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does</span>
<span class="s0">not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of</span>
<span class="s0">conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples</span>
<span class="s0">lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in</span>
<span class="s0">something else.</span>

<span class="s0">The French historians, describing the condition of the French army</span>
<span class="s0">before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,</span>
<span class="s0">except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport--there was no</span>
<span class="s0">forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one</span>
<span class="s0">could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather</span>
<span class="s0">than let the French have it.</span>

<span class="s0">The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the</span>
<span class="s0">peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally</span>
<span class="s0">failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable</span>
<span class="s0">multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for</span>
<span class="s0">the high price offered them, but burned it instead.</span>

<span class="s0">Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with</span>
<span class="s0">rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The</span>
<span class="s0">fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants,</span>
<span class="s0">feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke</span>
<span class="s0">but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first</span>
<span class="s0">cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine</span>
<span class="s0">that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest</span>
<span class="s0">means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by</span>
<span class="s0">traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case,</span>
<span class="s0">insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to</span>
<span class="s0">all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity</span>
<span class="s0">would result from such an account of the duel.</span>

<span class="s0">The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of</span>
<span class="s0">fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier</span>
<span class="s0">and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to</span>
<span class="s0">explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the</span>
<span class="s0">historians who have described the event.</span>

<span class="s0">After the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow any</span>
<span class="s0">previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the</span>
<span class="s0">retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodino and the renewed</span>
<span class="s0">retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the</span>
<span class="s0">seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures</span>
<span class="s0">from the rules.</span>

<span class="s0">Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing</span>
<span class="s0">attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent's rapier saw a cudgel</span>
<span class="s0">raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutuzov and</span>
<span class="s0">to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to</span>
<span class="s0">all the rules--as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite</span>
<span class="s0">of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the</span>
<span class="s0">rules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to</span>
<span class="s0">assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and</span>
<span class="s0">to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on--the cudgel of the</span>
<span class="s0">people's war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength,</span>
<span class="s0">and without consulting anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of</span>
<span class="s0">anything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but</span>
<span class="s0">consistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had</span>
<span class="s0">perished.</span>

<span class="s0">And it is well for a people who do not--as the French did in 1813-</span>
<span class="s0">salute according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt</span>
<span class="s0">of their rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their</span>
<span class="s0">magnanimous conqueror, but at the moment of trial, without asking what</span>
<span class="s0">rules others have adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick</span>
<span class="s0">up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of</span>
<span class="s0">contempt and compassion.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the</span>
<span class="s0">so-called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men</span>
<span class="s0">pressed together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that</span>
<span class="s0">take on a national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds</span>
<span class="s0">opposing each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when</span>
<span class="s0">attacked by stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers.</span>
<span class="s0">This was done by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in</span>
<span class="s0">the Caucasus, and by the Russians in 1812.</span>

<span class="s0">People have called this kind of war &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; and assume</span>
<span class="s0">that by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a</span>
<span class="s0">war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a</span>
<span class="s0">well-known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That</span>
<span class="s0">rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to</span>
<span class="s0">be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict.</span>

<span class="s0">Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly</span>
<span class="s0">infringes that rule.</span>

<span class="s0">This contradiction arises from the fact that military science</span>
<span class="s0">assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers.</span>
<span class="s0">Military science says that the more troops the greater the strength.</span>
<span class="s0">Les gros bataillons ont toujours raison.*</span>


<span class="s0">*Large battalions are always victorious.</span>


<span class="s0">For military science to say this is like defining momentum in</span>
<span class="s0">mechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are</span>
<span class="s0">equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved</span>
<span class="s0">are equal or unequal.</span>

<span class="s0">Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.</span>

<span class="s0">In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its</span>
<span class="s0">mass and some unknown x.</span>

<span class="s0">Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the</span>
<span class="s0">fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and</span>
<span class="s0">that small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the</span>
<span class="s0">existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it--now in a</span>
<span class="s0">geometric formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most</span>
<span class="s0">usually, in the genius of the commanders. But the assignment of</span>
<span class="s0">these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which</span>
<span class="s0">accord with the historic facts.</span>

<span class="s0">Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to</span>
<span class="s0">gratify the &quot;heroes&quot;) of the efficacy of the directions issued in</span>
<span class="s0">wartime by commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.</span>

<span class="s0">That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the</span>
<span class="s0">greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the</span>
<span class="s0">men composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are</span>
<span class="s0">not, fighting under the command of a genius, in two--or three-line</span>
<span class="s0">formation, with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a</span>
<span class="s0">minute. Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most</span>
<span class="s0">advantageous conditions for fighting.</span>

<span class="s0">The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass</span>
<span class="s0">gives the resulting force. To define and express the significance of</span>
<span class="s0">this unknown factor--the spirit of an army--is a problem for science.</span>

<span class="s0">This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to</span>
<span class="s0">substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that</span>
<span class="s0">force becomes apparent--such as the commands of the general, the</span>
<span class="s0">equipment employed, and so on--mistaking these for the real</span>
<span class="s0">significance of the factor, and if we recognize this unknown</span>
<span class="s0">quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to</span>
<span class="s0">fight and to face danger. Only then, expressing known historic facts</span>
<span class="s0">by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor,</span>
<span class="s0">can we hope to define the unknown.</span>

<span class="s0">Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions,</span>
<span class="s0">or divisions, conquer--that is, kill or take captive--all the</span>
<span class="s0">others, while themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and</span>
<span class="s0">on the other fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to</span>
<span class="s0">the fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This</span>
<span class="s0">equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us</span>
<span class="s0">a ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected</span>
<span class="s0">historic units (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such</span>
<span class="s0">equations, a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws</span>
<span class="s0">should exist and might be discovered.</span>

<span class="s0">The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when</span>
<span class="s0">attacking, and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms</span>
<span class="s0">the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To</span>
<span class="s0">lead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by</span>
<span class="s0">movement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But</span>
<span class="s0">this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army</span>
<span class="s0">continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking</span>
<span class="s0">contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of</span>
<span class="s0">the troops occurs, as in all national wars.</span>

<span class="s0">The French, retreating in 1812--though according to tactics they</span>
<span class="s0">should have separated into detachments to defend themselves-</span>
<span class="s0">congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen</span>
<span class="s0">that only the mass held the army together. The Russians, on the</span>
<span class="s0">contrary, ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass, but</span>
<span class="s0">in fact they split up into small units, because their spirit had so</span>
<span class="s0">risen that separate individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the</span>
<span class="s0">French without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose</span>
<span class="s0">themselves to hardships and dangers.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk.</span>

<span class="s0">Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the</span>
<span class="s0">government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had</span>
<span class="s0">been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off</span>
<span class="s0">as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denis</span>
<span class="s0">Davydov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the</span>
<span class="s0">value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of</span>
<span class="s0">military science destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit</span>
<span class="s0">for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare.</span>

<span class="s0">On August 24 Davydov's first partisan detachment was formed and then</span>
<span class="s0">others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more</span>
<span class="s0">numerous these detachments became.</span>

<span class="s0">The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the</span>
<span class="s0">fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree-</span>
<span class="s0">the French army--and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October,</span>
<span class="s0">when the French were fleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds of</span>
<span class="s0">such companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some</span>
<span class="s0">that adopted all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs,</span>
<span class="s0">and the comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack</span>
<span class="s0">cavalry. There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and</span>
<span class="s0">groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan</span>
<span class="s0">commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the</span>
<span class="s0">course of a month; and there was Vasilisa, the wife of a village</span>
<span class="s0">elder, who slew hundreds of the French.</span>

<span class="s0">The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of</span>
<span class="s0">October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,</span>
<span class="s0">amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded and</span>
<span class="s0">captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,</span>
<span class="s0">hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the</span>
<span class="s0">end of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had</span>
<span class="s0">become clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what</span>
<span class="s0">could not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and</span>
<span class="s0">moving according to rules at a distance from the French, still</span>
<span class="s0">regarded many things as impossible. The small bands that had started</span>
<span class="s0">their activities long before and had already observed the French</span>
<span class="s0">closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big</span>
<span class="s0">detachments did not dare to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who</span>
<span class="s0">crept in among the French now considered everything possible.</span>

<span class="s0">On October 22, Denisov (who was one of the irregulars) was with</span>
<span class="s0">his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early</span>
<span class="s0">morning he and his party had been on the move. All day long he had</span>
<span class="s0">been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French</span>
<span class="s0">convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the</span>
<span class="s0">rest of the army, which--as was learned from spies and prisoners-</span>
<span class="s0">was moving under a strong escort to Smolensk. Besides Denisov and</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov (who also led a small party and moved in Denisov's vicinity),</span>
<span class="s0">the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this</span>
<span class="s0">convoy and, as Denisov expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for</span>
<span class="s0">it. Two of the commanders of large parties--one a Pole and the other a</span>
<span class="s0">German--sent invitations to Denisov almost simultaneously,</span>
<span class="s0">requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,&quot; said Denisov on</span>
<span class="s0">reading these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite</span>
<span class="s0">his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general,</span>
<span class="s0">he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command</span>
<span class="s0">of the Polish general. To the Polish general he replied to the same</span>
<span class="s0">effect, informing him that he was already under the command of the</span>
<span class="s0">German.</span>

<span class="s0">Having arranged matters thus, Denisov and Dolokhov intended, without</span>
<span class="s0">reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that</span>
<span class="s0">convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from</span>
<span class="s0">the village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo. To the left of the</span>
<span class="s0">road between Mikulino and Shamshevo there were large forests,</span>
<span class="s0">extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile</span>
<span class="s0">or more back from it. Through these forests Denisov and his party rode</span>
<span class="s0">all day, sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to</span>
<span class="s0">the very edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That</span>
<span class="s0">morning, Cossacks of Denisov's party had seized and carried off into</span>
<span class="s0">the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck</span>
<span class="s0">in the mud not far from Mikulino where the forest ran close to the</span>
<span class="s0">road. Since then, and until evening, the party had the movements of</span>
<span class="s0">the French without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach</span>
<span class="s0">Shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then, after joining</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a</span>
<span class="s0">watchman's hut in the forest less than a mile from Shamshevo, to</span>
<span class="s0">surprise the French at dawn, falling like an avalanche on their</span>
<span class="s0">heads from two sides, and rout and capture them all at one blow.</span>

<span class="s0">In their rear, more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest</span>
<span class="s0">came right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any</span>
<span class="s0">fresh columns of French should show themselves.</span>

<span class="s0">Beyond Shamshevo, Dolokhov was to observe the road in the same</span>
<span class="s0">way, to find out at what distance there were other French troops. They</span>
<span class="s0">reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denisov had two</span>
<span class="s0">hundred, and Dolokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of</span>
<span class="s0">numbers did not deter Denisov. All that he now wanted to know was what</span>
<span class="s0">troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a &quot;tongue&quot;--that</span>
<span class="s0">is, a man from the enemy column. That morning's attack on the wagons</span>
<span class="s0">had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all</span>
<span class="s0">been killed; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he</span>
<span class="s0">was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops</span>
<span class="s0">in that column.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear</span>
<span class="s0">of putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tikhon</span>
<span class="s0">Shcherbaty, a peasant of his party, to Shamshevo to try and seize at</span>
<span class="s0">least one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on in</span>
<span class="s0">advance.</span>




<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both</span>
<span class="s0">the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and</span>
<span class="s0">then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain</span>
<span class="s0">ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides.</span>
<span class="s0">Like his horse, which turned its head and laid its ears back, he</span>
<span class="s0">shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him. His</span>
<span class="s0">thin face with its short, thick black beard looked angry.</span>

<span class="s0">Beside Denisov rode an esaul,* Denisov's fellow worker, also in felt</span>
<span class="s0">cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.</span>


<span class="s0">*A captain of Cossacks.</span>


<span class="s0">Esaul Lovayski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,</span>
<span class="s0">pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm</span>
<span class="s0">self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to</span>
<span class="s0">say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first</span>
<span class="s0">glance at the esaul and Denisov one saw that the latter was wet and</span>
<span class="s0">uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the</span>
<span class="s0">esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always</span>
<span class="s0">and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was</span>
<span class="s0">one with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold</span>
<span class="s0">strength.</span>

<span class="s0">A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and</span>
<span class="s0">wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.</span>

<span class="s0">A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghiz mount with an</span>
<span class="s0">enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a</span>
<span class="s0">blue French overcoat.</span>

<span class="s0">Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform</span>
<span class="s0">and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on</span>
<span class="s0">to the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed</span>
<span class="s0">about him with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that</span>
<span class="s0">morning.</span>

<span class="s0">Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars</span>
<span class="s0">in threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in</span>
<span class="s0">French greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The</span>
<span class="s0">horses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether</span>
<span class="s0">chestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes,</span>
<span class="s0">looked strangely thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles,</span>
<span class="s0">reins, were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the</span>
<span class="s0">fallen leaves that strewed the road. The men sat huddled up trying not</span>
<span class="s0">to stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and</span>
<span class="s0">not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their</span>
<span class="s0">seats, their knees, and at the back of their necks. In the midst of</span>
<span class="s0">the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons, drawn by French horses</span>
<span class="s0">and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front,</span>
<span class="s0">rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the</span>
<span class="s0">water that lay in the ruts.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and</span>
<span class="s0">bumped his rider's knee against a tree.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, the devil!&quot; exclaimed Denisov angrily, and showing his teeth he</span>
<span class="s0">struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and</span>
<span class="s0">his comrades with mud.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from</span>
<span class="s0">hunger (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more</span>
<span class="s0">because he still had no news from Dolokhov and the man sent to capture</span>
<span class="s0">a &quot;tongue&quot; had not returned.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as</span>
<span class="s0">today. It's too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it</span>
<span class="s0">off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will</span>
<span class="s0">snatch the prey from under our noses,&quot; thought Denisov, continually</span>
<span class="s0">peering forward, hoping to see a messenger from Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to</span>
<span class="s0">the right, Denisov stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There's someone coming,&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">The esaul looked in the direction Denisov indicated.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not</span>
<span class="s0">presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="s0">esaul, who was fond of using words the Cossacks did not know.</span>

<span class="s0">The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer</span>
<span class="s0">visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary</span>
<span class="s0">gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and</span>
<span class="s0">drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,</span>
<span class="s0">standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young</span>
<span class="s0">lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denisov</span>
<span class="s0">and handed him a sodden envelope.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;From the general,&quot; said the officer. &quot;Please excuse its not being</span>
<span class="s0">quite dry.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, it's dangerous,'&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading the</span>
<span class="s0">dispatch. &quot;But Komarov and I&quot;--he pointed to the Cossack--&quot;were</span>
<span class="s0">prepared. We have each of us two pistols.... But what's this?&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">asked, noticing the French drummer boy. &quot;A prisoner? You've already</span>
<span class="s0">been in action? May I speak to him?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wostov! Petya!&quot; exclaimed Denisov, having run through the dispatch.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Why didn't you say who you were?&quot; and turning with a smile he held</span>
<span class="s0">out his hand to the lad.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer was Petya Rostov.</span>

<span class="s0">All the way Petya had been preparing himself to behave with</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer--without hinting at</span>
<span class="s0">their previous acquaintance. But as soon as Denisov smiled at him</span>
<span class="s0">Petya brightened up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner</span>
<span class="s0">he had been rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already</span>
<span class="s0">been in a battle near Vyazma and how a certain hussar had</span>
<span class="s0">distinguished himself there.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, I am glad to see you,&quot; Denisov interrupted him, and his</span>
<span class="s0">face again assumed its anxious expression.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Michael Feoklitych,&quot; said he to the esaul, &quot;this is again fwom that</span>
<span class="s0">German, you know. He&quot;--he indicated Petya--&quot;is serving under him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a</span>
<span class="s0">repetition of the German general's demand that he should join forces</span>
<span class="s0">with him for an attack on the transport.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch it fwom under our</span>
<span class="s0">noses,&quot; he added.</span>

<span class="s0">While Denisov was talking to the esaul, Petya--abashed by</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov's cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition</span>
<span class="s0">of his trousers--furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat</span>
<span class="s0">so that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air</span>
<span class="s0">as possible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Will there be any orders, your honor?&quot; he asked Denisov, holding</span>
<span class="s0">his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general</span>
<span class="s0">for which he had prepared himself, &quot;or shall I remain with your</span>
<span class="s0">honor?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Orders?&quot; Denisov repeated thoughtfully. &quot;But can you stay till</span>
<span class="s0">tomowwow?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, please... May I stay with you?&quot; cried Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">asked Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya blushed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He gave me no instructions. I think I could?&quot; he returned,</span>
<span class="s0">inquiringly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, all wight,&quot; said Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting</span>
<span class="s0">place arranged near the watchman's hut in the forest, and told the</span>
<span class="s0">officer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant)</span>
<span class="s0">to go and find out where Dolokhov was and whether he would come that</span>
<span class="s0">evening. Denisov himself intended going with the esaul and Petya to</span>
<span class="s0">the edge of the forest where it reached out to Shamshevo, to have a</span>
<span class="s0">look at the part of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, old fellow,&quot; said he to the peasant guide, &quot;lead us to</span>
<span class="s0">Shamshevo.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov, Petya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and</span>
<span class="s0">the hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to</span>
<span class="s0">the edge of the forest.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from</span>
<span class="s0">the trees. Denisov, the esaul, and Petya rode silently, following</span>
<span class="s0">the peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned</span>
<span class="s0">toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet</span>
<span class="s0">leaves, silently led them to the edge of the forest.</span>

<span class="s0">He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to</span>
<span class="s0">where the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree</span>
<span class="s0">that had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously</span>
<span class="s0">to them with his hand.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov and Petya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant</span>
<span class="s0">was standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest,</span>
<span class="s0">on a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a</span>
<span class="s0">steep ravine, was a small village and a landowner's house with a</span>
<span class="s0">broken roof. In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well,</span>
<span class="s0">by the pond, over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill</span>
<span class="s0">from the bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred</span>
<span class="s0">yards away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist.</span>
<span class="s0">Their un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining</span>
<span class="s0">uphill with the carts, and their calls to one another, could be</span>
<span class="s0">clearly heard.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bwing the prisoner here,&quot; said Denisov in a low voice, not taking</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes off the French.</span>

<span class="s0">A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov. Pointing to the French troops, Denisov asked him what these</span>
<span class="s0">and those of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his</span>
<span class="s0">pockets and lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denisov in affright, but</span>
<span class="s0">in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused</span>
<span class="s0">answers, merely assenting to everything Denisov asked him. Denisov</span>
<span class="s0">turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his</span>
<span class="s0">own conjectures to him.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy,</span>
<span class="s0">now at Denisov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village</span>
<span class="s0">and along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It is a very suitable spot,&quot; said the esaul.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We'll send the infantwy down by the swamps,&quot; Denisov continued.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;They'll cweep up to the garden; you'll wide up fwom there with the</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks&quot;--he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village--&quot;and</span>
<span class="s0">I with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The hollow is impassable--there's a swamp there,&quot; said the esaul.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded</span>
<span class="s0">from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared,</span>
<span class="s0">then another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French</span>
<span class="s0">voices shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov and the esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought</span>
<span class="s0">they were the cause of the firing and shouting. But the firing and</span>
<span class="s0">shouting did not relate to them. Down below, a man wearing something</span>
<span class="s0">red was running through the marsh. The French were evidently firing</span>
<span class="s0">and shouting at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, that's our Tikhon,&quot; said the esaul.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So it is! It is!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The wascal!&quot; said Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He'll get away!&quot; said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">The man whom they called Tikhon, having run to the stream, plunged</span>
<span class="s0">in so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared</span>
<span class="s0">for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet,</span>
<span class="s0">and ran on. The French who had been pursuing him stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Smart, that!&quot; said the esaul.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a beast!&quot; said Denisov with his former look of vexation. &quot;What</span>
<span class="s0">has he been doing all this time?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who is he?&quot; asked Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's our plastun. I sent him to capture a 'tongue.'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Petya, nodding at the first words Denisov uttered as</span>
<span class="s0">if he understood it all, though he really did not understand</span>
<span class="s0">anything of it.</span>

<span class="s0">Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their</span>
<span class="s0">band. He was a peasant from Pokrovsk, near the river Gzhat. When</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov had come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and</span>
<span class="s0">had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew</span>
<span class="s0">about the French, the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied,</span>
<span class="s0">as all village elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything</span>
<span class="s0">of them. But when Denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the</span>
<span class="s0">French, and asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied</span>
<span class="s0">that some &quot;more-orderers&quot; had really been at their village, but that</span>
<span class="s0">Tikhon Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters.</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov had Tikhon called and, having praised him for his activity,</span>
<span class="s0">said a few words in the elder's presence about loyalty to the Tsar and</span>
<span class="s0">the country and the hatred of the French that all sons of the</span>
<span class="s0">fatherland should cherish.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We don't do the French any harm,&quot; said Tikhon, evidently frightened</span>
<span class="s0">by Denisov's words. &quot;We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you</span>
<span class="s0">know! We killed a score or so of 'more-orderers,' but we did no harm</span>
<span class="s0">else...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Next day when Denisov had left Pokrovsk, having quite forgotten</span>
<span class="s0">about this peasant, it was reported to him that Tikhon had attached</span>
<span class="s0">himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it.</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov gave orders to let him do so.</span>

<span class="s0">Tikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching</span>
<span class="s0">water, flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking</span>
<span class="s0">and aptitude for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for</span>
<span class="s0">booty and always brought back French clothing and weapons, and when</span>
<span class="s0">told to would bring in French captives also. Denisov then relieved him</span>
<span class="s0">from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on</span>
<span class="s0">expeditions and had him enrolled among the Cossacks.</span>

<span class="s0">Tikhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging</span>
<span class="s0">behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried</span>
<span class="s0">rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf</span>
<span class="s0">uses its teeth, with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or</span>
<span class="s0">crunching thick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs</span>
<span class="s0">with blows at arm's length, or holding the head of the ax would cut</span>
<span class="s0">thin little pegs or carve spoons. In Denisov's party he held a</span>
<span class="s0">peculiar and exceptional position. When anything particularly</span>
<span class="s0">difficult or nasty had to be done--to push a cart out of the mud</span>
<span class="s0">with one's shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail, skin</span>
<span class="s0">it, slink in among the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a</span>
<span class="s0">day--everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It won't hurt that devil--he's as strong as a horse!&quot; they said</span>
<span class="s0">of him.</span>

<span class="s0">Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at</span>
<span class="s0">him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which</span>
<span class="s0">Tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of</span>
<span class="s0">vodka) was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment-</span>
<span class="s0">jokes in which Tikhon readily joined.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?&quot; the Cossacks would</span>
<span class="s0">banter him. And Tikhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended</span>
<span class="s0">to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only</span>
<span class="s0">effect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he</span>
<span class="s0">seldom brought in prisoners.</span>

<span class="s0">He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found</span>
<span class="s0">more opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchmen, and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been</span>
<span class="s0">sent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a &quot;tongue.&quot; But</span>
<span class="s0">whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman</span>
<span class="s0">or because he had slept through the night, he had crept by day into</span>
<span class="s0">some bushes right among the French and, as Denisov had witnessed</span>
<span class="s0">from above, had been detected by them.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">After talking for some time with the esaul about next day's</span>
<span class="s0">attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to have definitely decided on, Denisov turned his horse and</span>
<span class="s0">rode back.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy,&quot; he said to Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped, peering into</span>
<span class="s0">the forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging</span>
<span class="s0">arms, wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan hat, was</span>
<span class="s0">approaching with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his</span>
<span class="s0">shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle. When he espied Denisov he</span>
<span class="s0">hastily threw something into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its</span>
<span class="s0">floppy brim, and approached his commander. It was Tikhon. His wrinkled</span>
<span class="s0">and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with</span>
<span class="s0">self-satisfied merriment. He lifted his head high and gazed at Denisov</span>
<span class="s0">as if repressing a laugh.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, where did you disappear to?&quot; inquired Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,&quot; answered Tikhon</span>
<span class="s0">boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well,</span>
<span class="s0">why haven't you taken one?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I took one all right,&quot; said Tikhon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where is he?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see, I took him first thing at dawn,&quot; Tikhon continued,</span>
<span class="s0">spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I took him into the forest. Then I see he's no good and think I'll go</span>
<span class="s0">and fetch a likelier one.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see?... What a wogue--it's just as I thought,&quot; said Denisov</span>
<span class="s0">to the esaul. &quot;Why didn't you bwing that one?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What was the good of bringing him?&quot; Tikhon interrupted hastily</span>
<span class="s0">and angrily--&quot;that one wouldn't have done for you. As if I don't</span>
<span class="s0">know what sort you want!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a bwute you are!... Well?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I went for another one,&quot; Tikhon continued, &quot;and I crept like this</span>
<span class="s0">through the wood and lay down.&quot; (He suddenly lay down on his stomach</span>
<span class="s0">with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) &quot;One turned up and</span>
<span class="s0">I grabbed him, like this.&quot; (He jumped up quickly and lightly.)</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;'Come along to the colonel,' I said. He starts yelling, and</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly there were four of them. They rushed at me with their</span>
<span class="s0">little swords. So I went for them with my ax, this way: 'What are</span>
<span class="s0">you up to?' says I. 'Christ be with you!'&quot; shouted Tikhon, waving</span>
<span class="s0">his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the</span>
<span class="s0">puddles!&quot; said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained</span>
<span class="s0">from laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to the</span>
<span class="s0">esaul's and Denisov's, unable to make out what it all meant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't play the fool!&quot; said Denisov, coughing angrily. &quot;Why didn't</span>
<span class="s0">you bwing the first one?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,</span>
<span class="s0">then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,</span>
<span class="s0">disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called</span>
<span class="s0">Shcherbaty--the gap-toothed). Denisov smiled, and Petya burst into a</span>
<span class="s0">peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,&quot; said Tikhon. &quot;The</span>
<span class="s0">clothes on him--poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your</span>
<span class="s0">honor! Why, he says: 'I'm a general's son myself, I won't go!' he</span>
<span class="s0">says.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are a bwute!&quot; said Denisov. &quot;I wanted to question...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I questioned him,&quot; said Tikhon. &quot;He said he didn't know much.</span>
<span class="s0">'There are a lot of us,' he says, 'but all poor stuff--only soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">in name,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' he says, 'and you'll take</span>
<span class="s0">them all,'&quot; Tikhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov's eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes--that'll teach you to play the</span>
<span class="s0">fool!&quot; said Denisov severely.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why are you angry?&quot; remonstrated Tikhon, &quot;just as if I'd</span>
<span class="s0">never seen your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I'll</span>
<span class="s0">fetch you any of them you want--three if you like.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, let's go,&quot; said Denisov, and rode all the way to the</span>
<span class="s0">watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily.</span>

<span class="s0">Tikhon followed behind and Petya heard the Cossacks laughing with</span>
<span class="s0">him and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the</span>
<span class="s0">bushes.</span>

<span class="s0">When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tikhon's words and</span>
<span class="s0">smile had passed and Petya realized for a moment that this Tikhon</span>
<span class="s0">had killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive</span>
<span class="s0">drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted</span>
<span class="s0">only a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his head higher, to</span>
<span class="s0">brace himself, and to question the esaul with an air of importance</span>
<span class="s0">about tomorrow's undertaking, that he might not be unworthy of the</span>
<span class="s0">company in which he found himself.</span>

<span class="s0">The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the way with</span>
<span class="s0">the news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov at once cheered up and, calling Petya to him, said: &quot;Well,</span>
<span class="s0">tell me about yourself.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">Petya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow,</span>
<span class="s0">joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general</span>
<span class="s0">commanding a large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his</span>
<span class="s0">commission, and especially since he had joined the active army and</span>
<span class="s0">taken part in the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in a constant state</span>
<span class="s0">of blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic</span>
<span class="s0">hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was</span>
<span class="s0">highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army, but</span>
<span class="s0">at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic</span>
<span class="s0">exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be.</span>
<span class="s0">And he was always in a hurry to get where he was not.</span>

<span class="s0">When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish</span>
<span class="s0">to send somebody to Denisov's detachment, Petya begged so piteously to</span>
<span class="s0">be sent that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he</span>
<span class="s0">recalled Petya's mad action at the battle of Vyazma, where instead</span>
<span class="s0">of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had</span>
<span class="s0">galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had</span>
<span class="s0">there twice fired his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade</span>
<span class="s0">his taking part in any action whatever of Denisov's. That was why</span>
<span class="s0">Petya had blushed and grown confused when Denisov asked him whether he</span>
<span class="s0">could stay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest</span>
<span class="s0">Petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and</span>
<span class="s0">return at once. But when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and</span>
<span class="s0">learned that there would certainly be an attack that night, he</span>
<span class="s0">decided, with the rapidity with which young people change their views,</span>
<span class="s0">that the general, whom he had greatly respected till then, was a</span>
<span class="s0">rubbishy German, that Denisov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and Tikhon</span>
<span class="s0">a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a</span>
<span class="s0">moment of difficulty.</span>

<span class="s0">It was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and the esaul</span>
<span class="s0">rode up to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be</span>
<span class="s0">seen, and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the</span>
<span class="s0">glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest</span>
<span class="s0">where the French could not see the smoke. In the passage of the</span>
<span class="s0">small watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some</span>
<span class="s0">mutton. In the room three officers of Denisov's band were converting a</span>
<span class="s0">door into a tabletop. Petya took off his wet clothes, gave them to</span>
<span class="s0">be dried, and at once began helping the officers to fix up the</span>
<span class="s0">dinner table.</span>

<span class="s0">In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the</span>
<span class="s0">table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.</span>

<span class="s0">Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton</span>
<span class="s0">with his hands, down which the grease trickled, Petya was in an</span>
<span class="s0">ecstatic childish state of love for all men, and consequently of</span>
<span class="s0">confidence that others loved him in the same way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So then what do you think, Vasili Dmitrich?&quot; said he to Denisov.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;It's all right my staying a day with you?&quot; And not waiting for a</span>
<span class="s0">reply he answered his own question: &quot;You see I was told to find out-</span>
<span class="s0">well, I am finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the</span>
<span class="s0">chief... I don't want a reward... But I want...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Petya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head</span>
<span class="s0">and flourishing his arms.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Into the vewy chief...&quot; Denisov repeated with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Only, please let me command something, so that I may really</span>
<span class="s0">command...&quot; Petya went on. &quot;What would it be to you?... Oh, you want a</span>
<span class="s0">knife?&quot; he said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a</span>
<span class="s0">piece of mutton.</span>

<span class="s0">And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Please keep it. I have several like it,&quot; said Petya, blushing.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Heavens! I was quite forgetting!&quot; he suddenly cried. &quot;I have some</span>
<span class="s0">raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler</span>
<span class="s0">and he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to</span>
<span class="s0">something sweet. Would you like some?...&quot; and Petya ran out into the</span>
<span class="s0">passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained</span>
<span class="s0">about five pounds of raisins. &quot;Have some, gentlemen, have some!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You want a coffeepot, don't you?&quot; he asked the esaul. &quot;I bought a</span>
<span class="s0">capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he's very</span>
<span class="s0">honest, that's the chief thing. I'll be sure to send it to you. Or</span>
<span class="s0">perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out--that happens</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are&quot;-</span>
<span class="s0">and he showed a bag--&quot;a hundred flints. I bought them very cheap.</span>
<span class="s0">Please take as many as you want, or all if you like....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Petya stopped and</span>
<span class="s0">blushed.</span>

<span class="s0">He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that</span>
<span class="s0">was foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered</span>
<span class="s0">the French drummer boy. &quot;It's capital for us here, but what of him?</span>
<span class="s0">Where have they put him? Have they fed him? Haven't they hurt his</span>
<span class="s0">feelings?&quot; he thought. But having caught himself saying too much about</span>
<span class="s0">the flints, he was now afraid to speak out.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I might ask,&quot; he thought, &quot;but they'll say: 'He's a boy himself and</span>
<span class="s0">so he pities the boy.' I'll show them tomorrow whether I'm a boy. Will</span>
<span class="s0">it seem odd if I ask?&quot; Petya thought. &quot;Well, never mind!&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">immediately, blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see</span>
<span class="s0">if they appeared ironical, he said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him</span>
<span class="s0">something to eat?... Perhaps...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he's a poor little fellow,&quot; said Denisov, who evidently saw</span>
<span class="s0">nothing shameful in this reminder. &quot;Call him in. His name is Vincent</span>
<span class="s0">Bosse. Have him fetched.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I'll call him,&quot; said Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,&quot; Denisov repeated.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this. He slipped in</span>
<span class="s0">between the officers, came close to Denisov, and said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bosse! Vincent!&quot; Petya cried, stopping outside the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who do you want, sir?&quot; asked a voice in the darkness.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured</span>
<span class="s0">that day.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, Vesenny?&quot; said a Cossack.</span>

<span class="s0">Vincent, the boy's name, had already been changed by the Cossacks</span>
<span class="s0">into Vesenny (vernal) and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers.</span>
<span class="s0">In both these adaptations the reference to spring (vesna) matched</span>
<span class="s0">the impression made by the young lad.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesenya!</span>
<span class="s0">Vesenya!--Vesenny!&quot; laughing voices were heard calling to one</span>
<span class="s0">another in the darkness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He's a smart lad,&quot; said an hussar standing near Petya. &quot;We gave him</span>
<span class="s0">something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the</span>
<span class="s0">darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, c'est vous!&quot; said Petya. &quot;Voulez-vous manger? N'ayez pas</span>
<span class="s0">peur, on ne vous fera pas de mal,&quot;* he added shyly and affectionately,</span>
<span class="s0">touching the boy's hand. &quot;Entrez, entrez.&quot;*[2]</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Ah, it's you! Do you want something to eat? Don't be afraid,</span>
<span class="s0">they won't hurt you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">*[2] &quot;Come in, come in.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Merci, monsieur,&quot;* said the drummer boy in a trembling almost</span>
<span class="s0">childish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">There were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but</span>
<span class="s0">did not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then</span>
<span class="s0">in the darkness he took the boy's hand and pressed it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come in, come in!&quot; he repeated in a gentle whisper. &quot;Oh, what can I</span>
<span class="s0">do for him?&quot; he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in</span>
<span class="s0">first.</span>

<span class="s0">When the boy had entered the hut, Petya sat down at a distance</span>
<span class="s0">from him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to</span>
<span class="s0">him. But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it</span>
<span class="s0">would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya's attention from the</span>
<span class="s0">drummer boy, to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given,</span>
<span class="s0">and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept</span>
<span class="s0">with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners. Petya</span>
<span class="s0">had heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov's extraordinary bravery</span>
<span class="s0">and of his cruelty to the French, so from the moment he entered the</span>
<span class="s0">hut Petya did not take his eyes from him, but braced himself up more</span>
<span class="s0">and more and held his head high, that he might not be unworthy even of</span>
<span class="s0">such company.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">the Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and</span>
<span class="s0">everything he did indicated his unusual position. But Dolokhov, who in</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow had worn a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most</span>
<span class="s0">correct officer of the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a</span>
<span class="s0">Guardsman's padded coat with an Order of St. George at his</span>
<span class="s0">buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head. He took</span>
<span class="s0">off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and without greeting</span>
<span class="s0">anyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter</span>
<span class="s0">in hand. Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had</span>
<span class="s0">on the transport, of the message Petya had brought, and his own</span>
<span class="s0">replies to both generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French</span>
<span class="s0">detachment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's so. But we must know what troops they are and their</span>
<span class="s0">numbers,&quot; said Dolokhov. &quot;It will be necessary to go there. We can't</span>
<span class="s0">start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I</span>
<span class="s0">like to work accurately. Here now--wouldn't one of these gentlemen</span>
<span class="s0">like to ride over to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare</span>
<span class="s0">uniform.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I, I... I'll go with you!&quot; cried Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There's no need for you to go at all,&quot; said Denisov, addressing</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov, &quot;and as for him, I won't let him go on any account.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I like that!&quot; exclaimed Petya. &quot;Why shouldn't I go?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because it's useless.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and</span>
<span class="s0">that's all. You'll take me, won't you?&quot; he said, turning to Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why not?&quot; Dolokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of</span>
<span class="s0">the French drummer boy. &quot;Have you had that youngster with you long?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he asked Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He was taken today but he knows nothing. I'm keeping him with me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and where do you put the others?&quot; inquired Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,&quot; shouted</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov, suddenly flushing. &quot;And I say boldly that I have not a single</span>
<span class="s0">man's life on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send</span>
<span class="s0">thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining-</span>
<span class="s0">I speak bluntly--staining the honor of a soldier?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count</span>
<span class="s0">of sixteen,&quot; said Dolokhov with cold irony, &quot;but it's time for you</span>
<span class="s0">to drop it.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, I've not said anything! I only say that I'll certainly go with</span>
<span class="s0">you,&quot; said Petya shyly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to drop these amenities,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">continued Dolokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking</span>
<span class="s0">of this subject which irritated Denisov. &quot;Now, why have you kept</span>
<span class="s0">this lad?&quot; he went on, swaying his head. &quot;Because you are sorry for</span>
<span class="s0">him! Don't we know those 'receipts' of yours? You send a hundred men</span>
<span class="s0">away, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So</span>
<span class="s0">isn't it all the same not to send them?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's not the point. I'm not going to discuss the matter. I do not</span>
<span class="s0">wish to take it on my conscience. You say they'll die. All wight. Only</span>
<span class="s0">not by my fault!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov began laughing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if</span>
<span class="s0">they did catch me they'd string me up to an aspen tree, and with all</span>
<span class="s0">your chivalry just the same.&quot; He paused. &quot;However, we must get to</span>
<span class="s0">work. Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms</span>
<span class="s0">in it. Well, are you coming with me?&quot; he asked Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I? Yes, yes, certainly!&quot; cried Petya, blushing almost to tears</span>
<span class="s0">and glancing at Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done</span>
<span class="s0">with prisoners, Petya had once more felt awkward and restless; but</span>
<span class="s0">again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;If grown-up, distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and</span>
<span class="s0">right,&quot; thought he. &quot;But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine</span>
<span class="s0">that I'll obey him and that he can order me about. I will certainly go</span>
<span class="s0">to the French camp with Dolokhov. If he can, so can I!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And to all Denisov's persuasions, Petya replied that he too was</span>
<span class="s0">accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that</span>
<span class="s0">he never considered personal danger.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;For you'll admit that if we don't know for sure how many of them</span>
<span class="s0">there are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are</span>
<span class="s0">only two of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go,</span>
<span class="s0">so don't hinder me,&quot; said he. &quot;It will only make things worse...&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, Petya and Dolokhov</span>
<span class="s0">rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French</span>
<span class="s0">camp, and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended</span>
<span class="s0">into the hollow. On reaching the bottom, Dolokhov told the Cossacks</span>
<span class="s0">accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot</span>
<span class="s0">along the road to the bridge. Petya, his heart in his mouth with</span>
<span class="s0">excitement, rode by his side.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If we're caught, I won't be taken alive! I have a pistol,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">whispered he.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't talk Russian,&quot; said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper, and at</span>
<span class="s0">that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: &quot;Qui</span>
<span class="s0">vive?&quot;* and the click of a musket.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Who goes there?&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The blood rushed to Petya's face and he grasped his pistol.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lanciers du 6-me,&quot;* replied Dolokhov, neither hastening nor</span>
<span class="s0">slackening his horse's pace.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Lancers of the 6th Regiment.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mot d'ordre.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Password.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Dites donc, le colonel Gerard est ici?&quot;* he asked.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Mot d'ordre,&quot; repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not</span>
<span class="s0">replying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas</span>
<span class="s0">le mot d'ordre...&quot; cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding</span>
<span class="s0">straight at the sentinel. &quot;Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;When an officer is making his round, sentinels don't ask him for</span>
<span class="s0">the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is here.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped</span>
<span class="s0">aside, Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk.</span>

<span class="s0">Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dolokhov</span>
<span class="s0">stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The</span>
<span class="s0">man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up</span>
<span class="s0">to Dolokhov's horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply</span>
<span class="s0">and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were</span>
<span class="s0">higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he</span>
<span class="s0">called the landowner's house.</span>

<span class="s0">Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk</span>
<span class="s0">could be heard around the campfires, Dolokhov turned into the</span>
<span class="s0">courtyard of the landowner's house. Having ridden in, he dismounted</span>
<span class="s0">and approached a big blazing campfire, around which sat several men</span>
<span class="s0">talking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge</span>
<span class="s0">of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by</span>
<span class="s0">the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, he's a hard nut to crack,&quot; said one of the officers who was</span>
<span class="s0">sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He'll make them get a move on, those fellows!&quot; said another,</span>
<span class="s0">laughing.</span>

<span class="s0">Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov's and Petya's steps as they advanced to the fire leading</span>
<span class="s0">their horses.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bonjour, messieurs!&quot;* said Dolokhov loudly and clearly.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Good day, gentlemen.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,</span>
<span class="s0">and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up</span>
<span class="s0">to Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is that you, Clement?&quot; he asked. &quot;Where the devil...?&quot; But, noticing</span>
<span class="s0">his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dolokhov as</span>
<span class="s0">a stranger, asking what he could do for him.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake</span>
<span class="s0">their regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether</span>
<span class="s0">they knew anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything,</span>
<span class="s0">and Petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov with hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were</span>
<span class="s0">silent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too</span>
<span class="s0">late,&quot; said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on</span>
<span class="s0">farther that night.</span>

<span class="s0">He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot</span>
<span class="s0">and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the</span>
<span class="s0">long neck. That officer did not take his eyes from Dolokhov and</span>
<span class="s0">again asked to what regiment he belonged. Dolokhov, as if he had not</span>
<span class="s0">heard the question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe</span>
<span class="s0">which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far</span>
<span class="s0">the road before them was safe from Cossacks.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Those brigands are everywhere,&quot; replied an officer from behind</span>
<span class="s0">the fire.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers</span>
<span class="s0">such as his companion and himself, &quot;but probably they would not dare</span>
<span class="s0">to attack large detachments?&quot; he added inquiringly. No one replied.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, now he'll come away,&quot; Petya thought every moment as he</span>
<span class="s0">stood by the campfire listening to the talk.</span>

<span class="s0">But Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and</span>
<span class="s0">began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the</span>
<span class="s0">battalion, how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about</span>
<span class="s0">the Russian prisoners with that detachment, Dolokhov said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would</span>
<span class="s0">be better to shoot such rabble,&quot; and burst into loud laughter, so</span>
<span class="s0">strange that Petya thought the French would immediately detect their</span>
<span class="s0">disguise, and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.</span>

<span class="s0">No one replied a word to Dolokhov's laughter, and a French officer</span>
<span class="s0">whom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and</span>
<span class="s0">whispered something to a companion. Dolokhov got up and called to</span>
<span class="s0">the soldier who was holding their horses.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Will they bring our horses or not?&quot; thought Petya, instinctively</span>
<span class="s0">drawing nearer to Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">The horses were brought.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good evening, gentlemen,&quot; said Dolokhov.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya wished to say &quot;Good night&quot; but could not utter a word. The</span>
<span class="s0">officers were whispering together. Dolokhov was a long time mounting</span>
<span class="s0">his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at</span>
<span class="s0">a footpace. Petya rode beside him, longing to look round to see</span>
<span class="s0">whether or no the French were running after them, but not daring to.</span>

<span class="s0">Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the</span>
<span class="s0">open country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and</span>
<span class="s0">listened. &quot;Do you hear?&quot; he asked. Petya recognized the sound of</span>
<span class="s0">Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round</span>
<span class="s0">their campfires. When they had descended to the bridge Petya and</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov rode past the sentinel, who without saying a word paced</span>
<span class="s0">morosely up and down it, then they descended into the hollow where the</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks awaited them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well now, good-by. Tell Denisov, 'at the first shot at</span>
<span class="s0">daybreak,'&quot; said Dolokhov and was about to ride away, but Petya seized</span>
<span class="s0">hold of him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Really!&quot; he cried, &quot;you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how</span>
<span class="s0">splendid! How I love you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;All right, all right!&quot; said Dolokhov. But Petya did not let go of</span>
<span class="s0">him and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward</span>
<span class="s0">him and wanted to kiss him. Dolokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his</span>
<span class="s0">horse, and vanished into the darkness.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">Having returned to the watchman's hut, Petya found Denisov in the</span>
<span class="s0">passage. He was awaiting Petya's return in a state of agitation,</span>
<span class="s0">anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Thank God!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Yes, thank God!&quot; he repeated,</span>
<span class="s0">listening to Petya's rapturous account. &quot;But, devil take you, I</span>
<span class="s0">haven't slept because of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can</span>
<span class="s0">still get a nap before morning.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But... no,&quot; said Petya, &quot;I don't want to sleep yet. Besides I</span>
<span class="s0">know myself, if I fall asleep it's finished. And then I am used to not</span>
<span class="s0">sleeping before a battle.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his</span>
<span class="s0">expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next</span>
<span class="s0">day.</span>

<span class="s0">Then, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he rose and went out of</span>
<span class="s0">doors.</span>

<span class="s0">It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were</span>
<span class="s0">still falling from the trees. Near the watchman's hut the black shapes</span>
<span class="s0">of the Cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered together could be</span>
<span class="s0">seen. Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their</span>
<span class="s0">horses beside them were discernible, and in the hollow the dying</span>
<span class="s0">campfire gleamed red. Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep;</span>
<span class="s0">here and there, amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of</span>
<span class="s0">the horses near by, could be heard low voices which seemed to be</span>
<span class="s0">whispering.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.</span>
<span class="s0">Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses</span>
<span class="s0">munching their oats. In the dark Petya recognized his own horse, which</span>
<span class="s0">he called &quot;Karabakh&quot; though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to</span>
<span class="s0">it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Karabakh! We'll do some service tomorrow,&quot; said he,</span>
<span class="s0">sniffing its nostrils and kissing it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why aren't you asleep, sir?&quot; said a Cossack who was sitting under a</span>
<span class="s0">wagon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, ah... Likhachev--isn't that your name? Do you know I have</span>
<span class="s0">only just come back! We've been into the French camp.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride</span>
<span class="s0">but also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his</span>
<span class="s0">life than to act &quot;just anyhow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you should get some sleep now,&quot; said the Cossack.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I am used to this,&quot; said Petya. &quot;I say, aren't the flints in</span>
<span class="s0">your pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don't you want any? You</span>
<span class="s0">can have some.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look</span>
<span class="s0">at Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Petya. &quot;Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and</span>
<span class="s0">then they're sorry for it afterwards. I don't like that.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just so,&quot; said the Cossack.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen</span>
<span class="s0">my saber for me? It's got bl...&quot; (Petya feared to tell a lie, and</span>
<span class="s0">the saber never had been sharpened.) &quot;Can you do it?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Of course I can.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Likhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Petya heard the</span>
<span class="s0">warlike sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat</span>
<span class="s0">on its edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I say! Are the lads asleep?&quot; asked Petya.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Some are, and some aren't--like us.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, and that boy?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vesenny? Oh, he's thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast</span>
<span class="s0">asleep after his fright. He was that glad!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">After that Petya remained silent for a long time, listening to the</span>
<span class="s0">sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure</span>
<span class="s0">appeared.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you sharpening?&quot; asked a man coming up to the wagon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why, this gentleman's saber.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's right,&quot; said the man, whom Petya took to be an hussar.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Was the cup left here?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, by the wheel!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The hussar took the cup.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It must be daylight soon,&quot; said he, yawning, and went away.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov's</span>
<span class="s0">guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon</span>
<span class="s0">captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under</span>
<span class="s0">it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark</span>
<span class="s0">blotch to the right was the watchman's hut, and the red blotch below</span>
<span class="s0">to the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had</span>
<span class="s0">come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew</span>
<span class="s0">nor waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom</span>
<span class="s0">where nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be</span>
<span class="s0">the watchman's hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very</span>
<span class="s0">depths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be</span>
<span class="s0">the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a</span>
<span class="s0">wagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon</span>
<span class="s0">but on a terribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have</span>
<span class="s0">to fall for a whole day or a whole month, or go on falling and never</span>
<span class="s0">reach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhachev, who</span>
<span class="s0">was sitting under the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest,</span>
<span class="s0">most wonderful, most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of.</span>
<span class="s0">It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back</span>
<span class="s0">into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished--disappeared</span>
<span class="s0">altogether and dissolved into nothingness.</span>

<span class="s0">Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was</span>
<span class="s0">in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.</span>

<span class="s0">He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the</span>
<span class="s0">earth. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were</span>
<span class="s0">swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if</span>
<span class="s0">the clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low</span>
<span class="s0">that one could touch it with one's hand.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya's eyes began to close and he swayed a little.</span>

<span class="s0">The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed</span>
<span class="s0">and jostled one another. Someone snored.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...&quot; hissed the saber against the</span>
<span class="s0">whetstone, and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing</span>
<span class="s0">some unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. Petya was as musical as Natasha and</span>
<span class="s0">more so than Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about</span>
<span class="s0">it, and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him</span>
<span class="s0">particularly fresh and attractive. The music became more and more</span>
<span class="s0">audible. The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another.</span>
<span class="s0">And what was played was a fugue--though Petya had not the least</span>
<span class="s0">conception of what a fugue is. Each instrument--now resembling a</span>
<span class="s0">violin and now a horn, but better and clearer than violin or horn-</span>
<span class="s0">played its own part, and before it had finished the melody merged with</span>
<span class="s0">another instrument that began almost the same air, and then with a</span>
<span class="s0">third and a fourth; and they all blended into one and again became</span>
<span class="s0">separate and again blended, now into solemn church music, now into</span>
<span class="s0">something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh--why, that was in a dream!&quot; Petya said to himself, as he lurched</span>
<span class="s0">forward. &quot;It's in my ears. But perhaps it's music of my own. Well,</span>
<span class="s0">go on, my music! Now!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance,</span>
<span class="s0">sounds fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again</span>
<span class="s0">all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. &quot;Oh, this is</span>
<span class="s0">delightful! As much as I like and as I like!&quot; said Petya to himself.</span>
<span class="s0">He tried to conduct that enormous orchestra.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now softly, softly die away!&quot; and the sounds obeyed him. &quot;Now</span>
<span class="s0">fuller, more joyful. Still more and more joyful!&quot; And from an</span>
<span class="s0">unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds. &quot;Now voices join</span>
<span class="s0">in!&quot; ordered Petya. And at first from afar he heard men's voices and</span>
<span class="s0">then women's. The voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and</span>
<span class="s0">Petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy.</span>

<span class="s0">With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from</span>
<span class="s0">the trees, and the hissing of the saber, &quot;Ozheg-zheg-zheg...&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">again the horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the</span>
<span class="s0">choir but joining in it.</span>

<span class="s0">Petya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all</span>
<span class="s0">the time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no</span>
<span class="s0">one to share it. He was awakened by Likhachev's kindly voice.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Petya woke up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's getting light, it's really getting light!&quot; he exclaimed.</span>

<span class="s0">The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to</span>
<span class="s0">their very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare</span>
<span class="s0">branches. Petya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket</span>
<span class="s0">and gave it to Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and</span>
<span class="s0">sheathed it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening</span>
<span class="s0">their saddle girths.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And here's the commander,&quot; said Likhachev.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov came out of the watchman's hut and, having called Petya,</span>
<span class="s0">gave orders to get ready.</span>




<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness,</span>
<span class="s0">tightened their saddle girths, and formed companies. Denisov stood</span>
<span class="s0">by the watchman's hut giving final orders. The infantry of the</span>
<span class="s0">detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the</span>
<span class="s0">trees in the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through</span>
<span class="s0">the mud. The esaul gave some orders to his men. Petya held his horse</span>
<span class="s0">by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face,</span>
<span class="s0">having been bathed in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were</span>
<span class="s0">particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down his spine and his</span>
<span class="s0">whole body pulsed rhythmically.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, is ev'wything weady?&quot; asked Denisov. &quot;Bwing the horses.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The horses were brought. Denisov was angry with the Cossack</span>
<span class="s0">because the saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted.</span>
<span class="s0">Petya put his foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to</span>
<span class="s0">nip his leg, but Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of</span>
<span class="s0">his own weight and, turning to look at the hussars starting in the</span>
<span class="s0">darkness behind him, rode up to Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for</span>
<span class="s0">God's sake...!&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov seemed to have forgotten Petya's very existence. He turned</span>
<span class="s0">to glance at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I ask one thing of you,&quot; he said sternly, &quot;to obey me and not shove</span>
<span class="s0">yourself forward anywhere.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He did not say another word to Petya but rode in silence all the</span>
<span class="s0">way. When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably</span>
<span class="s0">growing light over the field. Denisov talked in whispers with the</span>
<span class="s0">esaul and the Cossacks rode past Petya and Denisov. When they had</span>
<span class="s0">all ridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill.</span>
<span class="s0">Slipping onto their haunches and sliding, the horses descended with</span>
<span class="s0">their riders into the ravine. Petya rode beside Denisov, the pulsation</span>
<span class="s0">of his body constantly increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter,</span>
<span class="s0">but the mist still hid distant objects. Having reached the valley,</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov looked back and nodded to a Cossack beside him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The signal!&quot; said he.</span>

<span class="s0">The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the</span>
<span class="s0">tramp of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from</span>
<span class="s0">various sides, and then more shots.</span>

<span class="s0">At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Petya lashed his</span>
<span class="s0">horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov who</span>
<span class="s0">shouted at him. It seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was</span>
<span class="s0">fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the</span>
<span class="s0">bridge he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he</span>
<span class="s0">galloped on. In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were</span>
<span class="s0">running from right to left across the road. One of them fell in the</span>
<span class="s0">mud under his horse's feet.</span>

<span class="s0">Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the</span>
<span class="s0">midst of that crowd terrible screams arose. Petya galloped up, and the</span>
<span class="s0">first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,</span>
<span class="s0">clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!&quot; shouted Petya, and giving rein to his</span>
<span class="s0">excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.</span>

<span class="s0">He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged</span>
<span class="s0">Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,</span>
<span class="s0">were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red</span>
<span class="s0">face, had been defending himself against the hussars. When Petya</span>
<span class="s0">galloped up the Frenchman had already fallen. &quot;Too late again!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">flashed through Petya's mind and he galloped on to the place from</span>
<span class="s0">which the rapid firing could be heard. The shots came from the yard of</span>
<span class="s0">the landowner's house he had visited the night before with Dolokhov.</span>
<span class="s0">The French were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden</span>
<span class="s0">thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who</span>
<span class="s0">crowded at the gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached the</span>
<span class="s0">gate, Petya saw Dolokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish tint,</span>
<span class="s0">shouting to his men. &quot;Go round! Wait for the infantry!&quot; he exclaimed</span>
<span class="s0">as Petya rode up to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!&quot; shouted Petya, and without pausing a moment</span>
<span class="s0">galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the</span>
<span class="s0">smoke was thickest.</span>

<span class="s0">A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others</span>
<span class="s0">plashed against something. The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped after</span>
<span class="s0">Petya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke</span>
<span class="s0">some of the French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes</span>
<span class="s0">to meet the Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the</span>
<span class="s0">pond. Petya was galloping along the courtyard, but instead of</span>
<span class="s0">holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and</span>
<span class="s0">strangely, slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle. His</span>
<span class="s0">horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the</span>
<span class="s0">morning light, stopped suddenly, and Petya fell heavily on to the</span>
<span class="s0">wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly</span>
<span class="s0">though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his skull.</span>

<span class="s0">After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the</span>
<span class="s0">house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that</span>
<span class="s0">they surrendered, Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, who lay</span>
<span class="s0">motionless with outstretched arms.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Done for!&quot; he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov who was riding toward him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Killed?&quot; cried Denisov, recognizing from a distance the</span>
<span class="s0">unmistakably lifeless attitude--very familiar to him--in which Petya's</span>
<span class="s0">body was lying.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Done for!&quot; repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance of these words</span>
<span class="s0">afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who</span>
<span class="s0">were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. &quot;We won't take</span>
<span class="s0">them!&quot; he called out to Denisov.</span>

<span class="s0">Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, dismounted, and with</span>
<span class="s0">trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained,</span>
<span class="s0">mud-bespattered face which had already gone white.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">he recalled Petya's words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise</span>
<span class="s0">at the sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denisov turned</span>
<span class="s0">away, walked to the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.</span>

<span class="s0">Among the Russian prisoners rescued by Denisov and Dolokhov was</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre Bezukhov.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>

<span class="s0">During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been</span>
<span class="s0">issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners</span>
<span class="s0">among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party</span>
<span class="s0">was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it</span>
<span class="s0">had left Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled</span>
<span class="s0">the first stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other</span>
<span class="s0">half had gone on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had</span>
<span class="s0">marched in front of the prisoners was left; they had all</span>
<span class="s0">disappeared. The artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them</span>
<span class="s0">during the first days was now replaced by Marshal Junot's enormous</span>
<span class="s0">baggage train, convoyed by Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a</span>
<span class="s0">cavalry baggage train.</span>

<span class="s0">From Vyazma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in</span>
<span class="s0">three columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder</span>
<span class="s0">that Pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow had now reached the utmost limit.</span>

<span class="s0">The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead</span>
<span class="s0">horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments</span>
<span class="s0">continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again</span>
<span class="s0">lagging behind it.</span>

<span class="s0">Several times during the march false alarms had been given and the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run</span>
<span class="s0">headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and</span>
<span class="s0">abused each other for their causeless panic.</span>

<span class="s0">These three groups traveling together--the cavalry stores, the</span>
<span class="s0">convoy of prisoners, and Junot's baggage train--still constituted a</span>
<span class="s0">separate and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly</span>
<span class="s0">melting away.</span>

<span class="s0">Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred</span>
<span class="s0">and twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been</span>
<span class="s0">captured or left behind. Some of Junot's wagons also had been captured</span>
<span class="s0">or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers</span>
<span class="s0">from Davout's corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned</span>
<span class="s0">that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to</span>
<span class="s0">the prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had</span>
<span class="s0">been shot by the marshal's own order because a silver spoon</span>
<span class="s0">belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession.</span>

<span class="s0">The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three</span>
<span class="s0">hundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a</span>
<span class="s0">hundred now remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort</span>
<span class="s0">than even the cavalry saddles or Junot's baggage. They understood that</span>
<span class="s0">the saddles and Junot's spoon might be of some use, but that cold</span>
<span class="s0">and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and</span>
<span class="s0">hungry Russians who froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case</span>
<span class="s0">the order was to shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but</span>
<span class="s0">revolting. And the escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition</span>
<span class="s0">they themselves were in, of giving way to the pity they felt for the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse, treated</span>
<span class="s0">them with particular moroseness and severity.</span>

<span class="s0">At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores,</span>
<span class="s0">several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away,</span>
<span class="s0">but were recaptured by the French and shot.</span>

<span class="s0">The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been</span>
<span class="s0">abandoned. All who could walk went together, and after the third stage</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre had rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that</span>
<span class="s0">had chosen Karataev for its master.</span>

<span class="s0">On the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell ill with</span>
<span class="s0">the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he</span>
<span class="s0">grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know</span>
<span class="s0">why, but since Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an</span>
<span class="s0">effort to go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning</span>
<span class="s0">with which Karataev generally lay down at the halting places, and when</span>
<span class="s0">he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than</span>
<span class="s0">before, Pierre moved farther away and did not think about him.</span>

<span class="s0">While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his</span>
<span class="s0">intellect but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is</span>
<span class="s0">created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the</span>
<span class="s0">satisfaction of simple human needs, and that all unhappiness arises</span>
<span class="s0">not from privation but from superfluity. And now during these last</span>
<span class="s0">three weeks of the march he had learned still another new, consolatory</span>
<span class="s0">truth--that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned that</span>
<span class="s0">as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely</span>
<span class="s0">free, so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack</span>
<span class="s0">freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and</span>
<span class="s0">that those limits are very near together; that the person in a bed</span>
<span class="s0">of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now,</span>
<span class="s0">sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while</span>
<span class="s0">the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes</span>
<span class="s0">he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet</span>
<span class="s0">that were covered with sores--his footgear having long since fallen to</span>
<span class="s0">pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife--of his own</span>
<span class="s0">free will as it had seemed to him--he had been no more free than now</span>
<span class="s0">when they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself</span>
<span class="s0">subsequently termed his sufferings, but which at the time he</span>
<span class="s0">scarcely felt, the worst was the state of his bare, raw, and</span>
<span class="s0">scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing,</span>
<span class="s0">the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was</span>
<span class="s0">even pleasant; there was no great cold, it was always warm walking</span>
<span class="s0">in the daytime, and at night there were the campfires; the lice that</span>
<span class="s0">devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing that was at first hard to</span>
<span class="s0">bear was his feet.</span>

<span class="s0">After the second day's march Pierre, having examined his feet by the</span>
<span class="s0">campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when</span>
<span class="s0">everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,</span>
<span class="s0">walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more</span>
<span class="s0">terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,</span>
<span class="s0">but thought of other things.</span>

<span class="s0">Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the</span>
<span class="s0">saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to</span>
<span class="s0">another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows</span>
<span class="s0">superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain</span>
<span class="s0">limit.</span>

<span class="s0">He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who</span>
<span class="s0">lagged behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did</span>
<span class="s0">not think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would</span>
<span class="s0">soon have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about</span>
<span class="s0">himself. The harder his position became and the more terrible the</span>
<span class="s0">future, the more independent of that position in which he found</span>
<span class="s0">himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts, memories, and</span>
<span class="s0">imaginings that came to him.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill</span>
<span class="s0">along the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the</span>
<span class="s0">roughness of the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd</span>
<span class="s0">around him and then again at his feet. The former and the latter</span>
<span class="s0">were alike familiar and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran</span>
<span class="s0">merrily along the side of the road, sometimes in proof of its</span>
<span class="s0">agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along</span>
<span class="s0">on three, and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at</span>
<span class="s0">the crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleeker</span>
<span class="s0">than it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh of different</span>
<span class="s0">animals--from men to horses--in various stages of decomposition; and</span>
<span class="s0">as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all</span>
<span class="s0">it wanted.</span>

<span class="s0">It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment</span>
<span class="s0">it might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began</span>
<span class="s0">raining harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed</span>
<span class="s0">the water, which ran along the ruts in streams.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps</span>
<span class="s0">in threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally</span>
<span class="s0">addressing the rain, he repeated: &quot;Now then, now then, go on! Pelt</span>
<span class="s0">harder!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and</span>
<span class="s0">deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and</span>
<span class="s0">comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction</span>
<span class="s0">from a conversation with Karataev the day before.</span>

<span class="s0">At their yesterday's halting place, feeling chilly by a dying</span>
<span class="s0">campfire, Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was</span>
<span class="s0">burning better. There Platon Karataev was sitting covered up--head and</span>
<span class="s0">all--with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">knew. It was already past midnight, the hour when Karataev was usually</span>
<span class="s0">free of his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the</span>
<span class="s0">fire and heard Platon's voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his</span>
<span class="s0">pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at</span>
<span class="s0">his heart. His feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he</span>
<span class="s0">wished to go away, but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down,</span>
<span class="s0">trying not to look at Platon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, how are you?&quot; he asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won't grant us death,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">replied Platon, and at once resumed the story he had begun.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And so, brother,&quot; he continued, with a smile on his pale</span>
<span class="s0">emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes, &quot;you</span>
<span class="s0">see, brother...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre had long been familiar with that story. Karataev had told</span>
<span class="s0">it to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially</span>
<span class="s0">joyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that</span>
<span class="s0">tale as to something new, and the quiet rapture Karataev evidently</span>
<span class="s0">felt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was</span>
<span class="s0">of an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with his</span>
<span class="s0">family, and who went once to the Nizhni fair with a companion--a</span>
<span class="s0">rich merchant.</span>

<span class="s0">Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning</span>
<span class="s0">his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained</span>
<span class="s0">knife was found under the old merchant's pillow. He was tried,</span>
<span class="s0">knouted, and his nostrils having been torn off, &quot;all in due form&quot; as</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev put it, he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And so, brother&quot; (it was at this point that Pierre came up), &quot;ten</span>
<span class="s0">years or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict,</span>
<span class="s0">submitting as he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God</span>
<span class="s0">for death. Well, one night the convicts were gathered just as we</span>
<span class="s0">are, with the old man among them. And they began telling what each was</span>
<span class="s0">suffering for, and how they had sinned against God. One told how he</span>
<span class="s0">had taken a life, another had taken two, a third had set a house on</span>
<span class="s0">fire, while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. So</span>
<span class="s0">they asked the old man: 'What are you being punished for, Daddy?'--'I,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear brothers,' said he, 'am being punished for my own and other</span>
<span class="s0">men's sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was</span>
<span class="s0">not mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear brothers, and had much property. 'And he went on to tell</span>
<span class="s0">them all about it in due order. 'I don't grieve for myself,' he</span>
<span class="s0">says, 'God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my old</span>
<span class="s0">wife and the children,' and the old man began to weep. Now it happened</span>
<span class="s0">that in the group was the very man who had killed the other</span>
<span class="s0">merchant. 'Where did it happen, Daddy?' he said. 'When, and in what</span>
<span class="s0">month?' He asked all about it and his heart began to ache. So he comes</span>
<span class="s0">up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet! 'You are</span>
<span class="s0">perishing because of me, Daddy,' he says. 'It's quite true, lads, that</span>
<span class="s0">this man,' he says, 'is being tortured innocently and for nothing! I,'</span>
<span class="s0">he says, 'did that deed, and I put the knife under your head while you</span>
<span class="s0">were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,' he says, 'for Christ's sake!'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Karataev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and</span>
<span class="s0">he drew the logs together.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And the old man said, 'God will forgive you, we are all sinners</span>
<span class="s0">in His sight. I suffer for my own sins,' and he wept bitter tears.</span>
<span class="s0">Well, and what do you think, dear friends?&quot; Karataev continued, his</span>
<span class="s0">face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he</span>
<span class="s0">now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his</span>
<span class="s0">story: &quot;What do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to</span>
<span class="s0">the authorities. 'I have taken six lives,' he says (he was a great</span>
<span class="s0">sinner), 'but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don't let</span>
<span class="s0">him suffer because of me.' So he confessed and it was all written down</span>
<span class="s0">and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and</span>
<span class="s0">while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in</span>
<span class="s0">the papers all in due form--the authorities I mean--time passed. The</span>
<span class="s0">affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar's decree came: to</span>
<span class="s0">set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been</span>
<span class="s0">awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man.</span>
<span class="s0">'Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A</span>
<span class="s0">paper has come from the Tsar!' so they began looking for him,&quot; here</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev's lower jaw trembled, &quot;but God had already forgiven him--he</span>
<span class="s0">was dead! That's how it was, dear fellows!&quot; Karataev concluded and sat</span>
<span class="s0">for a long time silent, gazing before him with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">And Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story</span>
<span class="s0">itself but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that</span>
<span class="s0">lit up Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic significance of</span>
<span class="s0">that joy.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;A vos places!&quot;* suddenly cried a voice.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;To your places.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something</span>
<span class="s0">joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left</span>
<span class="s0">came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners at a trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension</span>
<span class="s0">people feel at the approach of those in authority. The prisoners</span>
<span class="s0">thronged together and were pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!&quot; and hardly had</span>
<span class="s0">the sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses</span>
<span class="s0">rattled by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat</span>
<span class="s0">with a tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of</span>
<span class="s0">the marshals. His eye fell on Pierre's large and striking figure,</span>
<span class="s0">and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.</span>

<span class="s0">The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with</span>
<span class="s0">a red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several</span>
<span class="s0">officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their</span>
<span class="s0">faces all looked excited and worried.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What did he say? What did he say?&quot; Pierre heard them ask.</span>

<span class="s0">While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in</span>
<span class="s0">a crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that</span>
<span class="s0">morning. He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On</span>
<span class="s0">his face, besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday</span>
<span class="s0">while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently,</span>
<span class="s0">there was now an expression of quiet solemnity.</span>

<span class="s0">Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with</span>
<span class="s0">tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say</span>
<span class="s0">something to him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself.</span>
<span class="s0">He made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away.</span>

<span class="s0">When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round.</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch</span>
<span class="s0">tree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look</span>
<span class="s0">round again but went limping up the hill.</span>

<span class="s0">From behind, where Karataev had been sitting, came the sound of a</span>
<span class="s0">shot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that</span>
<span class="s0">he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk--a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And</span>
<span class="s0">he again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one</span>
<span class="s0">of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale,</span>
<span class="s0">and in the expression on their faces--one of them glanced timidly at</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre--there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of</span>
<span class="s0">the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and</span>
<span class="s0">remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt</span>
<span class="s0">while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.</span>

<span class="s0">Behind him, where Karataev had been sitting, the dog began to</span>
<span class="s0">howl. &quot;What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?&quot; thought Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided</span>
<span class="s0">looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog</span>
<span class="s0">was howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their</span>
<span class="s0">faces.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal's baggage train stopped</span>
<span class="s0">at the village of Shamshevo. The men crowded together round the</span>
<span class="s0">campfires. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh,</span>
<span class="s0">lay down with his back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He</span>
<span class="s0">again slept as he had done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino.</span>

<span class="s0">Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or</span>
<span class="s0">another, gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same</span>
<span class="s0">thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and</span>
<span class="s0">that movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in</span>
<span class="s0">consciousness of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and</span>
<span class="s0">more blessed than all else is to love this life in one's sufferings,</span>
<span class="s0">in innocent sufferings.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Karataev!&quot; came to Pierre's mind.</span>

<span class="s0">And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly</span>
<span class="s0">old man who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. &quot;Wait a</span>
<span class="s0">bit,&quot; said the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was</span>
<span class="s0">alive--a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface</span>
<span class="s0">consisted of drops closely pressed together, and all these drops moved</span>
<span class="s0">and changed places, sometimes several of them merging into one,</span>
<span class="s0">sometimes one dividing into many. Each drop tried to spread out and</span>
<span class="s0">occupy as much space as possible, but others striving to do the same</span>
<span class="s0">compressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That is life,&quot; said the old teacher.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How simple and clear it is,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;How is it I did not</span>
<span class="s0">know it before?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect</span>
<span class="s0">Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from</span>
<span class="s0">the surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now,</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said the teacher.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you understand, damn you?&quot; shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.</span>

<span class="s0">He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a</span>
<span class="s0">Russian soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting</span>
<span class="s0">a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and</span>
<span class="s0">his sinewy, hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned</span>
<span class="s0">the ramrod. His brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly</span>
<span class="s0">visible by the glow of the charcoal.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's all the same to him,&quot; he muttered, turning quickly to a</span>
<span class="s0">soldier who stood behind him. &quot;Brigand! Get away!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned</span>
<span class="s0">away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier</span>
<span class="s0">the Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting</span>
<span class="s0">something with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the</span>
<span class="s0">blue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, he's come?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;And Plat-&quot; he began, but did not</span>
<span class="s0">finish.</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his</span>
<span class="s0">fancy--of the look Platon had given him as he sat under the tree, of</span>
<span class="s0">the shot heard from that spot, of the dog's howl, of the guilty</span>
<span class="s0">faces of the two Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and</span>
<span class="s0">smoking gun, and of Karataev's absence at this halt--and he was on the</span>
<span class="s0">point of realizing that Karataev had been killed, but just at that</span>
<span class="s0">instant, he knew not why, the recollection came to his mind of a</span>
<span class="s0">summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady on the</span>
<span class="s0">veranda of his house in Kiev. And without linking up the events of the</span>
<span class="s0">day or drawing a conclusion from them, Pierre closed his eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories</span>
<span class="s0">of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating globe, and he sank into</span>
<span class="s0">water so that it closed over his head.</span>

<span class="s0">Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid</span>
<span class="s0">firing. French soldiers were running past him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Cossacks!&quot; one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of</span>
<span class="s0">Russians surrounded Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">For a long time he could not understand what was happening to him.</span>
<span class="s0">All around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!&quot; old soldiers exclaimed, weeping,</span>
<span class="s0">as they embraced Cossacks and hussars.</span>

<span class="s0">The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered</span>
<span class="s0">them clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he</span>
<span class="s0">sat among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier</span>
<span class="s0">who approached him, and kissed him, weeping.</span>

<span class="s0">Dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd of</span>
<span class="s0">disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had</span>
<span class="s0">happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed</span>
<span class="s0">Dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched</span>
<span class="s0">them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent.</span>
<span class="s0">On the opposite side stood Dolokhov's Cossack, counting the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How many?&quot; Dolokhov asked the Cossack.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The second hundred,&quot; replied the Cossack.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Filez, filez!&quot;* Dolokhov kept saying, having adopted this</span>
<span class="s0">expression from the French, and when his eyes met those of the</span>
<span class="s0">prisoners they flashed with a cruel light.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Get along, get along!&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Denisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some</span>
<span class="s0">Cossacks who were carrying the body of Petya Rostov to a hole that had</span>
<span class="s0">been dug in the garden.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight</span>
<span class="s0">of the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men</span>
<span class="s0">freezing, or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while</span>
<span class="s0">carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past,</span>
<span class="s0">carrying away the property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings,</span>
<span class="s0">and dukes; but the process of the flight and disintegration of the</span>
<span class="s0">French army went on essentially as before.</span>

<span class="s0">From Moscow to Vyazma the French army of seventy-three thousand</span>
<span class="s0">men not reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but</span>
<span class="s0">pillage) was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five</span>
<span class="s0">thousand had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding</span>
<span class="s0">terms of the progression could be determined mathematically. The</span>
<span class="s0">French army melted away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to</span>
<span class="s0">Vyazma, from Vyazma to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and</span>
<span class="s0">from the Berezina to Vilna--independently of the greater or lesser</span>
<span class="s0">intensity of the cold, the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any</span>
<span class="s0">other particular conditions. Beyond Vyazma the French army instead</span>
<span class="s0">of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass, and so went</span>
<span class="s0">on to the end. Berthier wrote to his Emperor (we know how far</span>
<span class="s0">commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in</span>
<span class="s0">describing the condition of an army) and this is what he said:</span>


<span class="s0">I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the</span>
<span class="s0">various corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages</span>
<span class="s0">of the last two or three days' march. They are almost disbanded.</span>
<span class="s0">Scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of</span>
<span class="s0">their regiments, the others go off by themselves in different</span>
<span class="s0">directions hoping to find food and escape discipline. In general</span>
<span class="s0">they regard Smolensk as the place where they hope to recover. During</span>
<span class="s0">the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their</span>
<span class="s0">cartridges and their arms. In such a state of affairs, whatever your</span>
<span class="s0">ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your Majesty's service</span>
<span class="s0">demands that the army should be rallied at Smolensk and should first</span>
<span class="s0">of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted cavalry,</span>
<span class="s0">unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer in</span>
<span class="s0">proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out</span>
<span class="s0">with hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few days'</span>
<span class="s0">rest. Many have died last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This</span>
<span class="s0">state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear</span>
<span class="s0">that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be</span>
<span class="s0">under control in case of an engagement.</span>

<span class="s0">November 9: twenty miles from Smolensk.</span>


<span class="s0">After staggering into Smolensk which seemed to them a promised land,</span>
<span class="s0">the French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own</span>
<span class="s0">stores, and when everything had been plundered fled farther.</span>

<span class="s0">They all went without knowing whither or why they were going.</span>
<span class="s0">Still less did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any</span>
<span class="s0">orders to him. But still he and those about him retained their old</span>
<span class="s0">habits: wrote commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day;</span>
<span class="s0">called one another sire, mon cousin, prince d'Eckmuhl, roi de</span>
<span class="s0">Naples, and so on. But these orders and reports were only on paper,</span>
<span class="s0">nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out,</span>
<span class="s0">and though they entitled one another Majesties, Highnesses, or</span>
<span class="s0">Cousins, they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had</span>
<span class="s0">done much evil for which they had now to pay. And though they</span>
<span class="s0">pretended to be concerned about the army, each was thinking only of</span>
<span class="s0">himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself.</span>




<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign</span>
<span class="s0">from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian</span>
<span class="s0">blindman's bluff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of them</span>
<span class="s0">occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his</span>
<span class="s0">whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into</span>
<span class="s0">a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to</span>
<span class="s0">escape runs straight into his opponent's arms.</span>

<span class="s0">At first while they were still moving along the Kaluga road,</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's armies made their presence known, but later when they</span>
<span class="s0">reached the Smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell</span>
<span class="s0">tight--and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the</span>
<span class="s0">Russians.</span>

<span class="s0">Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit</span>
<span class="s0">and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of</span>
<span class="s0">approximately ascertaining the enemy's position--by cavalry</span>
<span class="s0">scouting--was not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent</span>
<span class="s0">and rapid change of position by each army, even what information was</span>
<span class="s0">obtained could not be delivered in time. If news was received one</span>
<span class="s0">day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before, by</span>
<span class="s0">the third day when something could have been done, that army was</span>
<span class="s0">already two days' march farther on and in quite another position.</span>

<span class="s0">One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smolensk there were</span>
<span class="s0">several different roads available for the French, and one would have</span>
<span class="s0">thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned</span>
<span class="s0">where the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan</span>
<span class="s0">and undertaken something new. But after a four days' halt the mob,</span>
<span class="s0">with no maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten</span>
<span class="s0">track, neither to the right nor to the left but along the old--the</span>
<span class="s0">worst--road, through Krasnoe and Orsha.</span>

<span class="s0">Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French</span>
<span class="s0">separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of</span>
<span class="s0">twenty-four hours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, then the</span>
<span class="s0">kings, then the dukes. The Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take</span>
<span class="s0">the road to the right beyond the Dnieper--which was the only</span>
<span class="s0">reasonable thing for him to do--themselves turned to the right and</span>
<span class="s0">came out onto the highroad at Krasnoe. And here as in a game of</span>
<span class="s0">blindman's buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing their enemy</span>
<span class="s0">unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the</span>
<span class="s0">sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their</span>
<span class="s0">comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days separate</span>
<span class="s0">portions of the French army--first Murat's (the vice-king's), then</span>
<span class="s0">Davout's, and then Ney's--ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage,</span>
<span class="s0">their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the</span>
<span class="s0">Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.</span>

<span class="s0">Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of</span>
<span class="s0">Smolensk which were in nobody's way, because despite the unfortunate</span>
<span class="s0">plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor</span>
<span class="s0">against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of</span>
<span class="s0">ten thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsha with only one thousand men</span>
<span class="s0">left, having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having</span>
<span class="s0">crossed the Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.</span>

<span class="s0">From Orsha they fled farther along the road to Vilna, still</span>
<span class="s0">playing at blindman's buff with the pursuing army. At the Berezina</span>
<span class="s0">they again became disorganized, many were drowned and many</span>
<span class="s0">surrendered, but those who got across the river fled farther. Their</span>
<span class="s0">supreme chief donned a fur coat and, having seated himself in a</span>
<span class="s0">sleigh, galloped on alone, abandoning his companions. The others who</span>
<span class="s0">could do so drove away too, leaving those who could not to surrender</span>
<span class="s0">or die.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVIII</span>


<span class="s0">This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which</span>
<span class="s0">they did all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they</span>
<span class="s0">turned onto the Kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the</span>
<span class="s0">army, none of the movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might</span>
<span class="s0">have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the</span>
<span class="s0">historians, who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of</span>
<span class="s0">one man, would have found it impossible to make the story of the</span>
<span class="s0">retreat fit their theory. But no! Mountains of books have been written</span>
<span class="s0">by the historians about this campaign, and everywhere are described</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's arrangements, the maneuvers, and his profound plans which</span>
<span class="s0">guided the army, as well as the military genius shown by his marshals.</span>

<span class="s0">The retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he had a free road into a</span>
<span class="s0">well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along</span>
<span class="s0">which Kutuzov afterwards pursued him--this unnecessary retreat along a</span>
<span class="s0">devastated road--is explained to us as being due to profound</span>
<span class="s0">considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for his</span>
<span class="s0">retreat from Smolensk to Orsha. Then his heroism at Krasnoe is</span>
<span class="s0">described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle</span>
<span class="s0">and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick</span>
<span class="s0">and said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;J'ai assez fait l'empereur; il est temps de faire le general,&quot;* but</span>
<span class="s0">nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the</span>
<span class="s0">scattered fragments of the army he left behind.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act the</span>
<span class="s0">general.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals,</span>
<span class="s0">especially of Ney--a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he</span>
<span class="s0">made his way by night around through the forest and across the Dnieper</span>
<span class="s0">and escaped to Orsha, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths</span>
<span class="s0">of his men.</span>

<span class="s0">And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic</span>
<span class="s0">army is presented to us by the historians as something great and</span>
<span class="s0">characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is</span>
<span class="s0">taught to be ashamed of--even that act finds justification in the</span>
<span class="s0">historians' language.</span>

<span class="s0">When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of</span>
<span class="s0">historical ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just, the historians</span>
<span class="s0">produce a saving conception of &quot;greatness.&quot; &quot;Greatness,&quot; it seems,</span>
<span class="s0">excludes the standards of right and wrong. For the &quot;great&quot; man nothing</span>
<span class="s0">is wrong, there is no atrocity for which a &quot;great&quot; man can be blamed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;C'est grand!&quot;* say the historians, and there no longer exists</span>
<span class="s0">either good or evil but only &quot;grand&quot; and &quot;not grand.&quot; Grand is good,</span>
<span class="s0">not grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of</span>
<span class="s0">some special animals called &quot;heroes.&quot; And Napoleon, escaping home in a</span>
<span class="s0">warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his</span>
<span class="s0">comrades but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que</span>
<span class="s0">c'est grand,*[2] and his soul is tranquil.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;It is great.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">*[2] That it is great.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n'y</span>
<span class="s0">a qu'un pas,&quot;* said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been</span>
<span class="s0">repeating: &quot;Sublime! Grand! Napoleon le Grand!&quot; Du sublime au ridicule</span>
<span class="s0">il n'y a qu'un pas.</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not</span>
<span class="s0">commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to</span>
<span class="s0">admit one's own nothingness and immeasurable meanness.</span>

<span class="s0">For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no</span>
<span class="s0">human actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where</span>
<span class="s0">simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign</span>
<span class="s0">of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is</span>
<span class="s0">that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three</span>
<span class="s0">armies surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered</span>
<span class="s0">French, hungry and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the</span>
<span class="s0">historians relate) the aim of the Russians was to stop the French,</span>
<span class="s0">to cut them off, and capture them all?</span>

<span class="s0">How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than</span>
<span class="s0">the French had given battle at Borodino, did not achieve its purpose</span>
<span class="s0">when it had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim</span>
<span class="s0">was to capture them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us</span>
<span class="s0">that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not</span>
<span class="s0">beat them? How could that happen?</span>

<span class="s0">History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions</span>
<span class="s0">says that this occurred because Kutuzov and Tormasov and Chichagov,</span>
<span class="s0">and this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers...</span>

<span class="s0">But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were</span>
<span class="s0">guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried</span>
<span class="s0">and punished? But even if we admitted that Kutuzov, Chichagov, and</span>
<span class="s0">others were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still</span>
<span class="s0">incomprehensible why, the position of the Russian army being what it</span>
<span class="s0">was at Krasnoe and at the Berezina (in both cases we had superior</span>
<span class="s0">forces), the French army with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not</span>
<span class="s0">captured, if that was what the Russians aimed at.</span>

<span class="s0">The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military</span>
<span class="s0">historians (to the effect that Kutuzov hindered an attack) is</span>
<span class="s0">unfounded, for we know that he could not restrain the troops from</span>
<span class="s0">attacking at Vyazma and Tarutino.</span>

<span class="s0">Why was the Russian army--which with inferior forces had withstood</span>
<span class="s0">the enemy in full strength at Borodino--defeated at Krasnoe and the</span>
<span class="s0">Berezina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was</span>
<span class="s0">numerically superior?</span>

<span class="s0">If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon and his marshals--and that aim was not merely frustrated</span>
<span class="s0">but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled--then</span>
<span class="s0">this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the</span>
<span class="s0">French to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly considered</span>
<span class="s0">victorious by Russian historians.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims</span>
<span class="s0">of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical</span>
<span class="s0">rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit</span>
<span class="s0">that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon and defeats for Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a</span>
<span class="s0">conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French</span>
<span class="s0">victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series of</span>
<span class="s0">Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the</span>
<span class="s0">liberation of their country.</span>

<span class="s0">The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the</span>
<span class="s0">historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns</span>
<span class="s0">and the generals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth,</span>
<span class="s0">have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that</span>
<span class="s0">never existed, namely that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">with his marshals and his army.</span>

<span class="s0">There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have</span>
<span class="s0">been senseless and its attainment quite impossible.</span>

<span class="s0">It would have been senseless, first because Napoleon's</span>
<span class="s0">disorganized army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that</span>
<span class="s0">is to say, was doing just what every Russian desired. So what was</span>
<span class="s0">the use of performing various operations on the French who were</span>
<span class="s0">running away as fast as they possibly could?</span>

<span class="s0">Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men</span>
<span class="s0">whose whole energy was directed to flight.</span>

<span class="s0">Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one's own</span>
<span class="s0">troops in order to destroy the French army, which without external</span>
<span class="s0">interference was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its</span>
<span class="s0">path was not blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than</span>
<span class="s0">it actually did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original</span>
<span class="s0">army.</span>

<span class="s0">Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, kings, and dukes--whose capture would have been in the</span>
<span class="s0">highest degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit</span>
<span class="s0">diplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized.</span>
<span class="s0">Still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of</span>
<span class="s0">the French, when our own army had melted away to half before</span>
<span class="s0">reaching Krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy</span>
<span class="s0">the corps of prisoners, and when our men were not always getting</span>
<span class="s0">full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger.</span>

<span class="s0">All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon</span>
<span class="s0">and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving</span>
<span class="s0">out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had</span>
<span class="s0">planted, should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The</span>
<span class="s0">only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he</span>
<span class="s0">was very angry. But not even that could be said for those who drew</span>
<span class="s0">up this project, for it was not they who had suffered from the</span>
<span class="s0">trampled beds.</span>

<span class="s0">But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would</span>
<span class="s0">have been senseless, it was impossible.</span>

<span class="s0">It was impossible first because--as experience shows that a</span>
<span class="s0">three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with</span>
<span class="s0">the plans--the probability of Chichagov, Kutuzov, and Wittgenstein</span>
<span class="s0">effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to</span>
<span class="s0">be tantamount to impossibility, as in fact thought Kutuzov, who when</span>
<span class="s0">he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great</span>
<span class="s0">distances do not yield the desired results.</span>

<span class="s0">Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with</span>
<span class="s0">which Napoleon's army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than</span>
<span class="s0">the Russians possessed would have been required.</span>

<span class="s0">Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term &quot;to cut off&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">has no meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army.</span>
<span class="s0">To cut off an army--to bar its road--is quite impossible, for there is</span>
<span class="s0">always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when</span>
<span class="s0">nothing can be seen, as the military scientists might convince</span>
<span class="s0">themselves by the example of Krasnoe and of the Berezina. It is only</span>
<span class="s0">possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it</span>
<span class="s0">is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one's hand. Men</span>
<span class="s0">can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules</span>
<span class="s0">of strategy and tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops</span>
<span class="s0">quite rightly did not consider that this suited them, since death by</span>
<span class="s0">hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike.</span>

<span class="s0">Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the</span>
<span class="s0">world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those</span>
<span class="s0">that obtained in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the</span>
<span class="s0">French strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done</span>
<span class="s0">more without destroying itself.</span>

<span class="s0">During the movement of the Russian army from Tarutino to Krasnoe</span>
<span class="s0">it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to</span>
<span class="s0">the population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of</span>
<span class="s0">the army without a battle.</span>

<span class="s0">And it is of this period of the campaign--when the army lacked boots</span>
<span class="s0">and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and</span>
<span class="s0">was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees</span>
<span class="s0">of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and</span>
<span class="s0">the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be</span>
<span class="s0">maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where</span>
<span class="s0">discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for</span>
<span class="s0">months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and</span>
<span class="s0">cold, when half the army perished in a single month--it is of this</span>
<span class="s0">period of the campaign that the historians tell us how Miloradovich</span>
<span class="s0">should have made a flank march to such and such a place, Tormasov to</span>
<span class="s0">another place, and Chichagov should have crossed (more than</span>
<span class="s0">knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so &quot;routed&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;cut off&quot; the French and so on and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should</span>
<span class="s0">have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not</span>
<span class="s0">to blame because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed</span>
<span class="s0">that they should do what was impossible.</span>

<span class="s0">All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between</span>
<span class="s0">the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the</span>
<span class="s0">historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the</span>
<span class="s0">beautiful words and sentiments of various generals, and not the</span>
<span class="s0">history of the events.</span>

<span class="s0">To them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting, and so do</span>
<span class="s0">their surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but</span>
<span class="s0">the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals</span>
<span class="s0">and in graves does not even interest them, for it does not come within</span>
<span class="s0">the range of their investigation.</span>

<span class="s0">Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans</span>
<span class="s0">and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who</span>
<span class="s0">took a direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed</span>
<span class="s0">insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.</span>

<span class="s0">The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in</span>
<span class="s0">the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it</span>
<span class="s0">was senseless and unattainable.</span>

<span class="s0">The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion.</span>
<span class="s0">That aim was attained in the first place of itself, as the French</span>
<span class="s0">ran away, and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight.</span>
<span class="s0">Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying</span>
<span class="s0">the French, and thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was</span>
<span class="s0">following the French, ready to use its strength in case their movement</span>
<span class="s0">stopped.</span>

<span class="s0">The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the</span>
<span class="s0">experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a</span>
<span class="s0">menace than to strike the running animal on the head.</span>





<span class="s0">BOOK FIFTEEN: 1812 --13</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror:</span>
<span class="s0">substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it</span>
<span class="s0">is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this</span>
<span class="s0">horror at the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual</span>
<span class="s0">wound, which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">heals, but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.</span>

<span class="s0">After Prince Andrew's death Natasha and Princess Mary alike felt</span>
<span class="s0">this. Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing</span>
<span class="s0">cloud of death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the</span>
<span class="s0">face. They carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and</span>
<span class="s0">painful contact. Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street,</span>
<span class="s0">a summons to dinner, the maid's inquiry what dress to prepare, or</span>
<span class="s0">worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an</span>
<span class="s0">insult, painfully irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary</span>
<span class="s0">quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful</span>
<span class="s0">choir that still resounded in their imagination, and hindered their</span>
<span class="s0">gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant</span>
<span class="s0">had opened out before them.</span>

<span class="s0">Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and</span>
<span class="s0">pain. They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it</span>
<span class="s0">was of very unimportant matters.</span>

<span class="s0">Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of</span>
<span class="s0">a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did</span>
<span class="s0">they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them</span>
<span class="s0">that what they had lived through and experienced could not be</span>
<span class="s0">expressed in words, and that any reference to the details of his</span>
<span class="s0">life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished before their eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of</span>
<span class="s0">everything that might lead up to the subject--this halting on all</span>
<span class="s0">sides at the boundary of what they might not mention--brought before</span>
<span class="s0">their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were</span>
<span class="s0">both feeling.</span>

<span class="s0">But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete</span>
<span class="s0">joy. Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent</span>
<span class="s0">arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was</span>
<span class="s0">the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which</span>
<span class="s0">she had dwelt for the first fortnight. She received letters from her</span>
<span class="s0">relations to which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas</span>
<span class="s0">had been put was damp and he began to cough; Alpatych came to</span>
<span class="s0">Yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice</span>
<span class="s0">and suggestions that they should return to Moscow to the house on</span>
<span class="s0">the Vozdvizhenka Street, which had remained uninjured and needed</span>
<span class="s0">only slight repairs. Life did not stand still and it was necessary</span>
<span class="s0">to live. Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm</span>
<span class="s0">of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then, and</span>
<span class="s0">sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natasha alone, yet the</span>
<span class="s0">cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded</span>
<span class="s0">to them. She went through the accounts with Alpatych, conferred with</span>
<span class="s0">Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and made preparations</span>
<span class="s0">for the journey to Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making</span>
<span class="s0">preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary asked the countess to let Natasha go with her to</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw</span>
<span class="s0">their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change</span>
<span class="s0">of scene and the advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am not going anywhere,&quot; Natasha replied when this was proposed to</span>
<span class="s0">her. &quot;Do please just leave me alone!&quot; And she ran out of the room,</span>
<span class="s0">with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation</span>
<span class="s0">rather than of sorrow.</span>

<span class="s0">After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her</span>
<span class="s0">grief, Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself,</span>
<span class="s0">sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and</span>
<span class="s0">twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing</span>
<span class="s0">intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This</span>
<span class="s0">solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of</span>
<span class="s0">it. As soon as anyone entered she got up quickly, changed her position</span>
<span class="s0">and expression, and picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting</span>
<span class="s0">impatiently for the intruder to go.</span>

<span class="s0">She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that</span>
<span class="s0">on which--with a terrible questioning too great for her strength-</span>
<span class="s0">her spiritual gaze was fixed.</span>

<span class="s0">One day toward the end of December Natasha, pale and thin, dressed</span>
<span class="s0">in a black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a</span>
<span class="s0">knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously</span>
<span class="s0">crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at</span>
<span class="s0">a corner of the door.</span>

<span class="s0">She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone--to the other</span>
<span class="s0">side of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never</span>
<span class="s0">before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and</span>
<span class="s0">improbable, was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible</span>
<span class="s0">than this side of life, where everything was either emptiness and</span>
<span class="s0">desolation or suffering and indignity.</span>

<span class="s0">She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine</span>
<span class="s0">him otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he</span>
<span class="s0">had been at Mytishchi, at Troitsa, and at Yaroslavl.</span>

<span class="s0">She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own,</span>
<span class="s0">and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.</span>

<span class="s0">There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning</span>
<span class="s0">his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and</span>
<span class="s0">a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs</span>
<span class="s0">twitches just perceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha knows that he is</span>
<span class="s0">struggling with terrible pain. &quot;What is that pain like? Why does he</span>
<span class="s0">have that pain? What does he feel? How does it hurt him?&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. He noticed her watching him, raised his eyes, and began to</span>
<span class="s0">speak seriously:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;One thing would be terrible,&quot; said he: &quot;to bind oneself forever</span>
<span class="s0">to a suffering man. It would be continual torture.&quot; And he looked</span>
<span class="s0">searchingly at her. Natasha as usual answered before she had time to</span>
<span class="s0">think what she would say. She said: &quot;This can't go on--it won't. You</span>
<span class="s0">will get well--quite well.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what</span>
<span class="s0">she had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at</span>
<span class="s0">those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in</span>
<span class="s0">that protracted gaze.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I agreed,&quot; Natasha now said to herself, &quot;that it would be</span>
<span class="s0">dreadful if he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because</span>
<span class="s0">it would have been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently.</span>
<span class="s0">He thought it would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live</span>
<span class="s0">and feared death. And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not</span>
<span class="s0">say what I meant. I thought quite differently. Had I said what I</span>
<span class="s0">thought, I should have said: even if he had to go on dying, to die</span>
<span class="s0">continually before my eyes, I should have been happy compared with</span>
<span class="s0">what I am now. Now there is nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No,</span>
<span class="s0">he did not and never will know it. And now it will never, never be</span>
<span class="s0">possible to put it right.&quot; And now he again seemed to be saying the</span>
<span class="s0">same words to her, only in her imagination Natasha this time gave</span>
<span class="s0">him a different answer. She stopped him and said: &quot;Terrible for you,</span>
<span class="s0">but not for me! You know that for me there is nothing in life but you,</span>
<span class="s0">and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me,&quot; and he</span>
<span class="s0">took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible</span>
<span class="s0">evening four days before his death. And in her imagination she said</span>
<span class="s0">other tender and loving words which she might have said then but</span>
<span class="s0">only spoke now: &quot;I love thee!... thee! I love, love...&quot; she said,</span>
<span class="s0">convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate</span>
<span class="s0">effort...</span>

<span class="s0">She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in</span>
<span class="s0">her eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.</span>
<span class="s0">Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again</span>
<span class="s0">with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And</span>
<span class="s0">now, now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at</span>
<span class="s0">the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing</span>
<span class="s0">itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her</span>
<span class="s0">ears. Dunyasha, her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a</span>
<span class="s0">frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Come to your Papa at once, please!&quot; said she with a strange,</span>
<span class="s0">excited look. &quot;A misfortune... about Peter Ilynich... a letter,&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">finished with a sob.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>


<span class="s0">Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natasha was feeling</span>
<span class="s0">a special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of</span>
<span class="s0">them--her father, mother, and Sonya--were so near to her, so familiar,</span>
<span class="s0">so commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult</span>
<span class="s0">to the world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not</span>
<span class="s0">merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard</span>
<span class="s0">Dunyasha's words about Peter Ilynich and a misfortune, but did not</span>
<span class="s0">grasp them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live</span>
<span class="s0">their own old, quiet, and commonplace life,&quot; thought Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of</span>
<span class="s0">her mother's room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He had</span>
<span class="s0">evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were</span>
<span class="s0">choking him. When he saw Natasha he waved his arms despairingly and</span>
<span class="s0">burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round</span>
<span class="s0">face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Pe... Petya... Go, go, she... is calling...&quot; and weeping like a</span>
<span class="s0">child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost</span>
<span class="s0">fell into it, covering his face with his hands.</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natasha's whole</span>
<span class="s0">being. Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache</span>
<span class="s0">as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But</span>
<span class="s0">the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the</span>
<span class="s0">oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life.</span>
<span class="s0">The sight of her father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that</span>
<span class="s0">she heard through the door, made her immediately forget herself and</span>
<span class="s0">her own grief.</span>

<span class="s0">She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to</span>
<span class="s0">her mother's door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came</span>
<span class="s0">out from that room and taking Natasha by the arm said something to</span>
<span class="s0">her. Natasha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid</span>
<span class="s0">steps, pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with</span>
<span class="s0">herself, and then ran to her mother.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward</span>
<span class="s0">position, stretching out and beating her head against the wall.</span>
<span class="s0">Sonya and the maids were holding her arms.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha! Natasha!...&quot; cried the countess. &quot;It's not true... it's</span>
<span class="s0">not true... He's lying... Natasha!&quot; she shrieked, pushing those around</span>
<span class="s0">her away. &quot;Go away, all of you; it's not true! Killed!... ha, ha,</span>
<span class="s0">ha!... It's not true!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother,</span>
<span class="s0">embraced her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face</span>
<span class="s0">toward herself, and clung to her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,&quot; she kept on</span>
<span class="s0">whispering, not pausing an instant.</span>

<span class="s0">She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,</span>
<span class="s0">demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her</span>
<span class="s0">mother's dress.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...&quot; she whispered</span>
<span class="s0">incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her</span>
<span class="s0">own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.</span>

<span class="s0">The countess pressed her daughter's hand, closed her eyes, and</span>
<span class="s0">became quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed</span>
<span class="s0">swiftness, glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Natasha began to</span>
<span class="s0">press her daughter's head with all her strength. Then she turned</span>
<span class="s0">toward her daughter's face which was wincing with pain and gazed</span>
<span class="s0">long at it.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, you love me?&quot; she said in a soft trustful whisper.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, you would not deceive me? You'll tell me the whole truth?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look</span>
<span class="s0">there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;My darling Mummy!&quot; she repeated, straining all the power of her</span>
<span class="s0">love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that</span>
<span class="s0">crushed her mother.</span>

<span class="s0">And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing</span>
<span class="s0">to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in</span>
<span class="s0">the bloom of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the</span>
<span class="s0">next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother.</span>
<span class="s0">Her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the</span>
<span class="s0">countess every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling</span>
<span class="s0">her to life.</span>

<span class="s0">During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few</span>
<span class="s0">minutes, and Natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and</span>
<span class="s0">closed her eyes, but opened them again on hearing the bedstead</span>
<span class="s0">creak. The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won't you have some</span>
<span class="s0">tea?&quot; Natasha went up to her. &quot;You have improved in looks and grown</span>
<span class="s0">more manly,&quot; continued the countess, taking her daughter's hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mamma! What are you saying...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, he is no more, no more!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first</span>
<span class="s0">time.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>


<span class="s0">Princess Mary postponed her departure. Sonya and the count tried</span>
<span class="s0">to replace Natasha but could not. They saw that she alone was able</span>
<span class="s0">to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha remained constantly at her mother's side, sleeping on a lounge</span>
<span class="s0">chair in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her</span>
<span class="s0">incessantly because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones</span>
<span class="s0">soothed her mother.</span>

<span class="s0">The mother's wounded spirit could not heal. Petya's</span>
<span class="s0">death had torn from her half her life. When the news of Petya's</span>
<span class="s0">death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a</span>
<span class="s0">month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no</span>
<span class="s0">interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess,</span>
<span class="s0">this second blow, restored Natasha to life.</span>

<span class="s0">A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is</span>
<span class="s0">like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep</span>
<span class="s0">wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike</span>
<span class="s0">can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from</span>
<span class="s0">within.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha's wound healed in that way. She thought her life was</span>
<span class="s0">ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the</span>
<span class="s0">essence of life--love--was still active within her. Love awoke and</span>
<span class="s0">so did life.</span>

<span class="s0">Prince Andrew's last days had bound Princess Mary and Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another.</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked</span>
<span class="s0">after Natasha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed</span>
<span class="s0">in her mother's bedroom had strained Natasha's physical strength.</span>

<span class="s0">One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever, Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Natasha lay</span>
<span class="s0">down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away</span>
<span class="s0">she called her back.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I don't want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are tired--try to sleep.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;She is much better. She spoke so well today,&quot; said Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary's face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is she like him?&quot; thought Natasha. &quot;Yes, like and yet not like. But</span>
<span class="s0">she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me.</span>
<span class="s0">What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind</span>
<span class="s0">like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mary,&quot; she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary's hand to herself,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Mary, you mustn't think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love</span>
<span class="s0">you! Let us be quite, quite friends.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Natasha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her</span>
<span class="s0">feelings.</span>

<span class="s0">From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only</span>
<span class="s0">between women was established between Princess Mary and Natasha.</span>
<span class="s0">They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one</span>
<span class="s0">another and spent most of their time together. When one went out the</span>
<span class="s0">other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt</span>
<span class="s0">more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself</span>
<span class="s0">when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them;</span>
<span class="s0">an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other's</span>
<span class="s0">presence.</span>

<span class="s0">Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were</span>
<span class="s0">already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They</span>
<span class="s0">spoke most of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her</span>
<span class="s0">childhood, of her mother, her father, and her daydreams; and</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha, who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly</span>
<span class="s0">turned away from that life of devotion, submission, and the poetry</span>
<span class="s0">of Christian self-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary by affection, learned to love her past too and to understand a</span>
<span class="s0">side of life previously incomprehensible to her. She did not think</span>
<span class="s0">of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life, for she</span>
<span class="s0">was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood and loved in</span>
<span class="s0">another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary, listening to Natasha's tales of childhood and early youth, there</span>
<span class="s0">also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life: belief</span>
<span class="s0">in life and its enjoyment.</span>

<span class="s0">Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they</span>
<span class="s0">thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him</span>
<span class="s0">had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without</span>
<span class="s0">being conscious of it.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all</span>
<span class="s0">talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,</span>
<span class="s0">and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm</span>
<span class="s0">carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her</span>
<span class="s0">drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.</span>

<span class="s0">One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.</span>
<span class="s0">Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and</span>
<span class="s0">then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.</span>

<span class="s0">Another time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled, so she</span>
<span class="s0">called again--though she could hear Dunyasha coming--called her in the</span>
<span class="s0">deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, sing, and</span>
<span class="s0">listened attentively to herself.</span>

<span class="s0">She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the</span>
<span class="s0">layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable,</span>
<span class="s0">delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking</span>
<span class="s0">root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed</span>
<span class="s0">her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound</span>
<span class="s0">had begun to heal from within.</span>

<span class="s0">At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count</span>
<span class="s0">insisted on Natasha's going with her to consult the doctors.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>


<span class="s0">After the encounter at Vyazma, where Kutuzov had been unable to hold</span>
<span class="s0">back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy</span>
<span class="s0">and so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the</span>
<span class="s0">Russians who pursued them, continued as far as Krasnoe without a</span>
<span class="s0">battle. The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the</span>
<span class="s0">French could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke</span>
<span class="s0">down, and the information received of the movements of the French</span>
<span class="s0">was never reliable.</span>

<span class="s0">The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous</span>
<span class="s0">marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not</span>
<span class="s0">go any faster.</span>

<span class="s0">To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not</span>
<span class="s0">losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarutino and</span>
<span class="s0">less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that</span>
<span class="s0">place a hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with only fifty</span>
<span class="s0">thousand.</span>

<span class="s0">The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our</span>
<span class="s0">army as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference</span>
<span class="s0">was that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of</span>
<span class="s0">destruction as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen</span>
<span class="s0">were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind</span>
<span class="s0">were among their own people. The chief cause of the wastage of</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon's army was the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing</span>
<span class="s0">proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the</span>
<span class="s0">movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at</span>
<span class="s0">Tarutino and Vyazma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of</span>
<span class="s0">our army.</span>

<span class="s0">But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of</span>
<span class="s0">the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident,</span>
<span class="s0">another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself</span>
<span class="s0">to Kutuzov. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French.</span>
<span class="s0">The road the French would take was unknown, and so the closer our</span>
<span class="s0">troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover.</span>
<span class="s0">Only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag</span>
<span class="s0">path of the French. All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals</span>
<span class="s0">meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches,</span>
<span class="s0">whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches. To</span>
<span class="s0">that end Kutuzov's activity was directed during the whole campaign</span>
<span class="s0">from Moscow to Vilna--not casually or intermittently but so</span>
<span class="s0">consistently that he never once deviated from it.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov felt and knew--not by reasoning or science but with the</span>
<span class="s0">whole of his Russian being--what every Russian soldier felt: that</span>
<span class="s0">the French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven</span>
<span class="s0">out; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the</span>
<span class="s0">hardship of this march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled for</span>
<span class="s0">such a time of the year.</span>

<span class="s0">But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">army, who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody,</span>
<span class="s0">and for some reason to capture a king or a duke--it seemed that now-</span>
<span class="s0">when any battle must be horrible and senseless--was the very time to</span>
<span class="s0">fight and conquer somebody. Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when</span>
<span class="s0">one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with</span>
<span class="s0">those soldiers--ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved--who</span>
<span class="s0">within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half</span>
<span class="s0">their number, and who at the best if the flight continued would have</span>
<span class="s0">to go a greater distance than they had already traversed, before</span>
<span class="s0">they reached the frontier.</span>

<span class="s0">This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow,</span>
<span class="s0">and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians</span>
<span class="s0">stumbled on the French army.</span>

<span class="s0">So it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to find one of the three</span>
<span class="s0">French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen</span>
<span class="s0">thousand men. Despite all Kutuzov's efforts to avoid that ruinous</span>
<span class="s0">encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob</span>
<span class="s0">of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Krasnoe for three</span>
<span class="s0">days.</span>

<span class="s0">Toll wrote a disposition: &quot;The first column will march to so and</span>
<span class="s0">so,&quot; etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the</span>
<span class="s0">disposition. Prince Eugene of Wurttemberg fired from a hill over the</span>
<span class="s0">French crowds that were running past, and demanded reinforcements</span>
<span class="s0">which did not arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and</span>
<span class="s0">hid themselves in the forest by night, making their way round as</span>
<span class="s0">best they could, and continued their flight.</span>

<span class="s0">Miloradovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the</span>
<span class="s0">commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found</span>
<span class="s0">when he was wanted--that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche* as he</span>
<span class="s0">styled himself--who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys</span>
<span class="s0">demanding their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was</span>
<span class="s0">ordered to do.</span>


<span class="s0">*Knight without fear and without reproach.</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;I give you that column, lads,&quot; he said, riding up to the troops and</span>
<span class="s0">pointing out the French to the cavalry.</span>

<span class="s0">And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could</span>
<span class="s0">scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented to</span>
<span class="s0">them--that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,</span>
<span class="s0">frost-bitten, and starving--and the column that had been presented</span>
<span class="s0">to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been</span>
<span class="s0">anxious to do.</span>

<span class="s0">At Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several</span>
<span class="s0">hundred cannon, and a stick called a &quot;marshal's staff,&quot; and disputed</span>
<span class="s0">as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their</span>
<span class="s0">achievement--though they much regretted not having taken Napoleon,</span>
<span class="s0">or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, and reproached one</span>
<span class="s0">another and especially Kutuzov for having failed to do so.</span>

<span class="s0">These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of</span>
<span class="s0">the most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes</span>
<span class="s0">and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable</span>
<span class="s0">deed. They blamed Kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the</span>
<span class="s0">campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he</span>
<span class="s0">thought nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from</span>
<span class="s0">the Linen Factories because he was comfortable there, that at</span>
<span class="s0">Krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was</span>
<span class="s0">there he had quite lost his head, and that it was probable that he had</span>
<span class="s0">an understanding with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so</span>
<span class="s0">on, and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions,</span>
<span class="s0">talk in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as</span>
<span class="s0">grand, while Kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty,</span>
<span class="s0">dissolute, weak old courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite-</span>
<span class="s0">a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian name.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>


<span class="s0">In 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused of blundering. The</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written</span>
<span class="s0">by order of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutuzov was a</span>
<span class="s0">cunning court liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by</span>
<span class="s0">his blunders at Krasnoe and the Berezina he deprived the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">army of the glory of complete victory over the French.*</span>


<span class="s0">*History of the year 1812. The character of Kutuzov and</span>
<span class="s0">reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at Krasnoe,</span>
<span class="s0">by Bogdanovich.</span>


<span class="s0">Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian</span>
<span class="s0">mind does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary</span>
<span class="s0">individuals who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their</span>
<span class="s0">personal will to it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish</span>
<span class="s0">such men for discerning the higher laws.</span>

<span class="s0">For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon-</span>
<span class="s0">that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in</span>
<span class="s0">exile, showed human dignity--Napoleon is the object of adulation and</span>
<span class="s0">enthusiasm; he is grand. But Kutuzov--the man who from the beginning</span>
<span class="s0">to the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or</span>
<span class="s0">deed from Borodino to Vilna, presented an example exceptional in</span>
<span class="s0">history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future</span>
<span class="s0">importance of what was happening--Kutuzov seems to them something</span>
<span class="s0">indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of him and of the year</span>
<span class="s0">1812 they always seem a little ashamed.</span>

<span class="s0">And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose</span>
<span class="s0">activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be</span>
<span class="s0">difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the</span>
<span class="s0">will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find</span>
<span class="s0">an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being</span>
<span class="s0">so completely accomplished as that to which all Kutuzov's efforts were</span>
<span class="s0">directed in 1812.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov never talked of &quot;forty centuries looking down from the</span>
<span class="s0">Pyramids,&quot; of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of what</span>
<span class="s0">he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said</span>
<span class="s0">nothing about himself, adopted no prose, always appeared to be the</span>
<span class="s0">simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de</span>
<span class="s0">Stael, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with</span>
<span class="s0">generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who</span>
<span class="s0">tried to prove anything to him. When Count Rostopchin at the Yauza</span>
<span class="s0">bridge galloped up to Kutuzov with personal reproaches for having</span>
<span class="s0">caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: &quot;How was it you promised</span>
<span class="s0">not to abandon Moscow without a battle?&quot; Kutuzov replied: &quot;And I shall</span>
<span class="s0">not abandon Moscow without a battle,&quot; though Moscow was then already</span>
<span class="s0">abandoned. When Arakcheev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that</span>
<span class="s0">Ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutuzov replied:</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I was just saying so myself,&quot; though a moment before he had said</span>
<span class="s0">quite the contrary. What did it matter to him--who then alone amid a</span>
<span class="s0">senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what</span>
<span class="s0">was happening--what did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed</span>
<span class="s0">the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it</span>
<span class="s0">matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.</span>

<span class="s0">Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man--who by</span>
<span class="s0">experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the</span>
<span class="s0">words serving as their expression are not what move people--use</span>
<span class="s0">quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head.</span>

<span class="s0">But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the</span>
<span class="s0">whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single</span>
<span class="s0">aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite</span>
<span class="s0">of himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his</span>
<span class="s0">real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be</span>
<span class="s0">understood. Beginning with the battle of Borodino, from which time his</span>
<span class="s0">disagreement with those about him began, he alone said that the battle</span>
<span class="s0">of Borodino was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in</span>
<span class="s0">his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death. He alone</span>
<span class="s0">said that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to</span>
<span class="s0">Lauriston's proposal of peace, he said: There can be no peace, for</span>
<span class="s0">such is the people's will. He alone during the retreat of the French</span>
<span class="s0">said that all our maneuvers are useless, everything is being</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished of itself better than we could desire; that the enemy</span>
<span class="s0">must be offered &quot;a golden bridge&quot;; that neither the Tarutino, the</span>
<span class="s0">Vyazma, nor the Krasnoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some</span>
<span class="s0">force to reach the frontier with, and that he would not sacrifice a</span>
<span class="s0">single Russian for ten Frenchmen.</span>

<span class="s0">And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakcheev</span>
<span class="s0">to please the Emperor, he alone--incurring thereby the Emperor's</span>
<span class="s0">displeasure--said in Vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier</span>
<span class="s0">is useless and harmful.</span>

<span class="s0">Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of</span>
<span class="s0">the events. His actions--without the smallest deviation--were all</span>
<span class="s0">directed to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his</span>
<span class="s0">strength for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3)</span>
<span class="s0">to drive them out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the</span>
<span class="s0">sufferings of our people and of our army.</span>

<span class="s0">This procrastinator Kutuzov, whose motto was &quot;Patience and Time,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodino, investing</span>
<span class="s0">the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">who before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be</span>
<span class="s0">lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his</span>
<span class="s0">death that Borodino was a victory, despite the assurance of generals</span>
<span class="s0">that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have</span>
<span class="s0">to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during</span>
<span class="s0">the whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then,</span>
<span class="s0">should not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the</span>
<span class="s0">frontiers of Russia crossed.</span>

<span class="s0">It is easy now to understand the significance of these events--if</span>
<span class="s0">only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that</span>
<span class="s0">existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals--for the events and</span>
<span class="s0">results now lie before us.</span>

<span class="s0">But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general</span>
<span class="s0">opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the</span>
<span class="s0">events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?</span>

<span class="s0">The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of</span>
<span class="s0">the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he</span>
<span class="s0">possessed in full purity and strength.</span>

<span class="s0">Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling</span>
<span class="s0">caused the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's wish,</span>
<span class="s0">to select him--an old man in disfavor--to be their representative in</span>
<span class="s0">the national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest</span>
<span class="s0">human pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all</span>
<span class="s0">his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing</span>
<span class="s0">pity on them.</span>

<span class="s0">That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not</span>
<span class="s0">be cast in the false mold of a European hero--the supposed ruler of</span>
<span class="s0">men--that history has invented.</span>

<span class="s0">To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception</span>
<span class="s0">of greatness.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>


<span class="s0">The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle</span>
<span class="s0">of Krasnoe. Toward evening--after much disputing and many mistakes</span>
<span class="s0">made by generals who did not go to their proper places, and after</span>
<span class="s0">adjutants had been sent about with counterorders--when it had become</span>
<span class="s0">plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and</span>
<span class="s0">would be no battle, Kutuzov left Krasnoe and went to Dobroe whither</span>
<span class="s0">his headquarters had that day been transferred.</span>

<span class="s0">The day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his plump</span>
<span class="s0">little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented</span>
<span class="s0">generals who whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the</span>
<span class="s0">road groups of French prisoners captured that day (there were seven</span>
<span class="s0">thousand of them) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires.</span>
<span class="s0">Near Dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with</span>
<span class="s0">talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get</span>
<span class="s0">hold of, were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed</span>
<span class="s0">French guns. At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of</span>
<span class="s0">talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov who, wearing a white</span>
<span class="s0">cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round</span>
<span class="s0">shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white horse. One of</span>
<span class="s0">the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had</span>
<span class="s0">been captured.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general</span>
<span class="s0">was saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he</span>
<span class="s0">gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a</span>
<span class="s0">specially wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by</span>
<span class="s0">frost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and</span>
<span class="s0">festering eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them,</span>
<span class="s0">one of whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of</span>
<span class="s0">raw flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial</span>
<span class="s0">in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the</span>
<span class="s0">malevolent expression with which, after a glance at Kutuzov, the</span>
<span class="s0">soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what</span>
<span class="s0">he was doing.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He</span>
<span class="s0">puckered his face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head.</span>
<span class="s0">At another spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a</span>
<span class="s0">Frenchman on the shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly</span>
<span class="s0">manner, and Kutuzov with the same expression on his face again</span>
<span class="s0">swayed his head.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What were you saying?&quot; he asked the general, who continuing his</span>
<span class="s0">report directed the commander in chief's attention to some standards</span>
<span class="s0">captured from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhensk</span>
<span class="s0">regiment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ah, the standards!&quot; said Kutuzov, evidently detaching himself</span>
<span class="s0">with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.</span>

<span class="s0">He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at</span>
<span class="s0">him from all sides awaiting a word from him.</span>

<span class="s0">He stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment, sighed deeply,</span>
<span class="s0">and closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in</span>
<span class="s0">chief with them. Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then,</span>
<span class="s0">submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his</span>
<span class="s0">position, raised his head and began to speak. A throng of officers</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded him. He looked attentively around at the circle of</span>
<span class="s0">officers, recognizing several of them.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I thank you all!&quot; he said, addressing the soldiers and then again</span>
<span class="s0">the officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words</span>
<span class="s0">were distinctly heard. &quot;I thank you all for your hard and faithful</span>
<span class="s0">service. The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor</span>
<span class="s0">to you forever.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He paused and looked around.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Lower its head, lower it!&quot; he said to a soldier who had</span>
<span class="s0">accidentally lowered the French eagle he was holding before the</span>
<span class="s0">Preobrazhensk standards. &quot;Lower, lower, that's it. Hurrah lads!&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">added, addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hur-r-rah!&quot; roared thousands of voices.</span>

<span class="s0">While the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov leaned forward in his</span>
<span class="s0">saddle and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and</span>
<span class="s0">apparently ironic gleam.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see, brothers...&quot; said he when the shouts had ceased... and all</span>
<span class="s0">at once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no</span>
<span class="s0">longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who</span>
<span class="s0">wanted to tell his comrades something very important.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of</span>
<span class="s0">the soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was</span>
<span class="s0">going to say.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You see, brothers, I know it's hard for you, but it can't be</span>
<span class="s0">helped! Bear up; it won't be for long now! We'll see our visitors</span>
<span class="s0">off and then we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your service. It is</span>
<span class="s0">hard for you, but still you are at home while they--you see what</span>
<span class="s0">they have come to,&quot; said he, pointing to the prisoners. &quot;Worse off</span>
<span class="s0">than our poorest beggars. While they were strong we didn't spare</span>
<span class="s0">ourselves, but now we may even pity them. They are human beings too.</span>
<span class="s0">Isn't it so, lads?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze</span>
<span class="s0">fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew</span>
<span class="s0">brighter and brighter with an old man's mild smile, which drew the</span>
<span class="s0">corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased</span>
<span class="s0">speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody</span>
<span class="s0">bastards!&quot; he cried, suddenly lifting his head.</span>

<span class="s0">And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first</span>
<span class="s0">time during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov's words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could</span>
<span class="s0">have repeated the field marshal's address, begun solemnly and then</span>
<span class="s0">changing into an old man's simplehearted talk; but the hearty</span>
<span class="s0">sincerity of that speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined</span>
<span class="s0">with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause,</span>
<span class="s0">exactly expressed by that old man's good-natured expletives, was not</span>
<span class="s0">merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found</span>
<span class="s0">expression in their joyous and long-sustained shouts. Afterwards</span>
<span class="s0">when one of the generals addressed Kutuzov asking whether he wished</span>
<span class="s0">his caleche to be sent for, Kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a</span>
<span class="s0">sob, being evidently greatly moved.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>


<span class="s0">When the troops reached their night's halting place on the eighth of</span>
<span class="s0">November, the last day of the Krasnoe battles, it was already</span>
<span class="s0">growing dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional</span>
<span class="s0">lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the</span>
<span class="s0">falling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost</span>
<span class="s0">grew keener.</span>

<span class="s0">An infantry regiment which had left Tarutino three thousand strong</span>
<span class="s0">but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that</span>
<span class="s0">night at its halting place--a village on the highroad. The</span>
<span class="s0">quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were</span>
<span class="s0">full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff.</span>
<span class="s0">There was only one hut available for the regimental commander.</span>

<span class="s0">The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the</span>
<span class="s0">village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.</span>

<span class="s0">Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its</span>
<span class="s0">lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep</span>
<span class="s0">through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village,</span>
<span class="s0">and immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of</span>
<span class="s0">branches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another</span>
<span class="s0">section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a</span>
<span class="s0">group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the</span>
<span class="s0">horses. A third section scattered through the village arranging</span>
<span class="s0">quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French corpses</span>
<span class="s0">that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and</span>
<span class="s0">thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve</span>
<span class="s0">for shelter.</span>

<span class="s0">Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle</span>
<span class="s0">wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, all together--shove!&quot; cried the voices, and the huge</span>
<span class="s0">surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost,</span>
<span class="s0">was seen swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked</span>
<span class="s0">more and more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had</span>
<span class="s0">been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That's it... Where</span>
<span class="s0">are you shoving to?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to</span>
<span class="s0">sing. At the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty</span>
<span class="s0">voices roared out at once: &quot;Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. All together!</span>
<span class="s0">Heave away, boys!...&quot; but despite their united efforts the wattle</span>
<span class="s0">hardly moved, and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing</span>
<span class="s0">of the men was audible.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...</span>
<span class="s0">will you? You may want us one of these days.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into</span>
<span class="s0">the village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about</span>
<span class="s0">thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the</span>
<span class="s0">village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of</span>
<span class="s0">the gasping men.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you up to?&quot; suddenly came the authoritative voice of a</span>
<span class="s0">sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;There are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you</span>
<span class="s0">foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I'll give it to you!&quot; shouted he,</span>
<span class="s0">hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Can't you make less noise?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and</span>
<span class="s0">wiped his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling</span>
<span class="s0">against the wattle.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;There, how that devil hits out! He's made my face all bloody,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Don't you like it?&quot; said a laughing voice, and moderating their</span>
<span class="s0">tones the men moved forward.</span>

<span class="s0">When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud</span>
<span class="s0">as before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.</span>

<span class="s0">In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered</span>
<span class="s0">and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day</span>
<span class="s0">and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a</span>
<span class="s0">flank march to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture</span>
<span class="s0">him.</span>

<span class="s0">By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place</span>
<span class="s0">the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood</span>
<span class="s0">crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers</span>
<span class="s0">flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been</span>
<span class="s0">trodden down.</span>

<span class="s0">Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without</span>
<span class="s0">any orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night,</span>
<span class="s0">shelters were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being</span>
<span class="s0">boiled, and muskets and accouterments put in order.</span>

<span class="s0">The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by</span>
<span class="s0">the Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket</span>
<span class="s0">rests, and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo,</span>
<span class="s0">called the roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for</span>
<span class="s0">the night--some repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some</span>
<span class="s0">stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>


<span class="s0">One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched</span>
<span class="s0">conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time--lacking warm</span>
<span class="s0">boots and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the</span>
<span class="s0">snow with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations</span>
<span class="s0">(the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)--they</span>
<span class="s0">would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.</span>

<span class="s0">On the contrary, the army had never under the best material</span>
<span class="s0">conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was</span>
<span class="s0">because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were</span>
<span class="s0">sifted out of the army day by day. All the physically or morally</span>
<span class="s0">weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the</span>
<span class="s0">army--physically and mentally--remained.</span>

<span class="s0">More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company</span>
<span class="s0">than anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and</span>
<span class="s0">their campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by</span>
<span class="s0">their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh, Makeev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you</span>
<span class="s0">lost or have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!&quot; shouted a</span>
<span class="s0">red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking</span>
<span class="s0">because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire. &quot;And you,</span>
<span class="s0">Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood!&quot; said he to another soldier.</span>

<span class="s0">This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being</span>
<span class="s0">robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier they</span>
<span class="s0">called &quot;Jackdaw,&quot; a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose</span>
<span class="s0">obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the</span>
<span class="s0">light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier</span>
<span class="s0">carrying a load of wood.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bring it here--that's fine!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with</span>
<span class="s0">their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats,</span>
<span class="s0">making the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit</span>
<span class="s0">their pipes. The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood,</span>
<span class="s0">setting his arms akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and</span>
<span class="s0">deftly on the spot where he stood.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It's well that I'm a</span>
<span class="s0">musketeer...&quot; he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look out, your soles will fly off!&quot; shouted the red-haired man,</span>
<span class="s0">noticing that the sole of the dancer's boot was hanging loose. &quot;What a</span>
<span class="s0">fellow you are for dancing!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw</span>
<span class="s0">it on the fire.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Right enough, friend,&quot; said he, and, having sat down, took out of</span>
<span class="s0">his knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his</span>
<span class="s0">foot. &quot;It's the steam that spoils them,&quot; he added, stretching out</span>
<span class="s0">his feet toward the fire.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They'll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we've</span>
<span class="s0">finished hammering them, we're to receive double kits!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after all, it</span>
<span class="s0">seems,&quot; said one sergeant major.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I've had an eye on him this long while,&quot; said the other.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, he's a poor sort of soldier...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, it's all very well, but when a man's feet are frozen how can</span>
<span class="s0">he walk?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Eh? Don't talk nonsense!&quot; said a sergeant major.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you want to be doing the same?&quot; said an old soldier, turning</span>
<span class="s0">reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, you know,&quot; said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in</span>
<span class="s0">a squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the</span>
<span class="s0">fire, &quot;a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it's death. Take</span>
<span class="s0">me, now! I've got no strength left,&quot; he added, with sudden</span>
<span class="s0">resolution turning to the sergeant major. &quot;Tell them to send me to</span>

<span class="s0">hospital; I'm aching all over; anyway I shan't be able to keep up.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That'll do, that'll do!&quot; replied the sergeant major quietly.</span>

<span class="s0">The soldier said no more and the talk went on.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is</span>
<span class="s0">that not one of them had what you might call real boots on,&quot; said a</span>
<span class="s0">soldier, starting a new theme. &quot;They were no more than make-believes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for</span>
<span class="s0">the colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">put in the dancer. &quot;As they turned them over one seemed still alive</span>
<span class="s0">and, would you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But they're a clean folk, lads,&quot; the first man went on; &quot;he was</span>
<span class="s0">white--as white as birchbark--and some of them are such fine</span>
<span class="s0">fellows, you might think they were nobles.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But they don't understand our talk at all,&quot; said the dancer with</span>
<span class="s0">a puzzled smile. &quot;I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in</span>
<span class="s0">his own way. A queer lot!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it's strange, friends,&quot; continued the man who had wondered at</span>
<span class="s0">their whiteness, &quot;the peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when</span>
<span class="s0">they began burying the dead--where the battle was you know--well,</span>
<span class="s0">those dead had been lying there for nearly a month, and says the</span>
<span class="s0">peasant, 'they lie as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell</span>
<span class="s0">as a puff of powder smoke.'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Was it from the cold?&quot; asked someone.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If</span>
<span class="s0">it had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. 'But,'</span>
<span class="s0">he says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,' he</span>
<span class="s0">says, 'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as</span>
<span class="s0">we drag them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,' he says, 'are</span>
<span class="s0">white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">All were silent.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It must be from their food,&quot; said the sergeant major. &quot;They used to</span>
<span class="s0">gobble the same food as the gentry.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">No one contradicted him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That peasant near Mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were</span>
<span class="s0">all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days</span>
<span class="s0">and still didn't finish carting the dead away. And as for the</span>
<span class="s0">wolves, he says...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That was a real battle,&quot; said an old soldier. &quot;It's the only one</span>
<span class="s0">worth remembering; but since that... it's only been tormenting folk.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them</span>
<span class="s0">and, my word, they didn't let us get near before they just threw</span>
<span class="s0">down their muskets and went on their knees. 'Pardon!' they say. That's</span>
<span class="s0">only one case. They say Platov took 'Poleon himself twice. But he</span>
<span class="s0">didn't know the right charm. He catches him and catches him--no</span>
<span class="s0">good! He turns into a bird in his hands and flies away. And there's no</span>
<span class="s0">way of killing him either.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You're a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I come to look at you!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Liar, indeed! It's the real truth.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If he fell into my hands, when I'd caught him I'd bury him in the</span>
<span class="s0">ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he's</span>
<span class="s0">ruined!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, anyhow we're going to end it. He won't come here again,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">remarked the old soldier, yawning.</span>

<span class="s0">The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to</span>
<span class="s0">sleep.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Look at the stars. It's wonderful how they shine! You would think</span>
<span class="s0">the women had spread out their linen,&quot; said one of the men, gazing</span>
<span class="s0">with admiration at the Milky Way.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;That's a sign of a good harvest next year.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We shall want some more wood.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That's queer.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he's</span>
<span class="s0">sprawling!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen</span>
<span class="s0">asleep could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now</span>
<span class="s0">and again exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces</span>
<span class="s0">off came a sound of general, merry laughter.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!&quot; said one of the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers, &quot;and what a lot of them there are!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They're having such fun,&quot; said he, coming back. &quot;Two Frenchies have</span>
<span class="s0">turned up. One's quite frozen and the other's an awful swaggerer. He's</span>
<span class="s0">singing songs....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, I'll go across and have a look....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>


<span class="s0">The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest.</span>
<span class="s0">A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow,</span>
<span class="s0">lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.</span>

<span class="s0">About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the</span>
<span class="s0">forest, and the crackling of dry branches.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;A bear, lads,&quot; said one of the men.</span>

<span class="s0">They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into</span>
<span class="s0">the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging</span>
<span class="s0">to one another.</span>

<span class="s0">These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They</span>
<span class="s0">came up to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers did not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an</span>
<span class="s0">officer's hat and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he</span>
<span class="s0">had been going to sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy</span>
<span class="s0">soldier with a shawl tied round his head, was stronger. He raised</span>
<span class="s0">his companion and said something, pointing to his mouth. The</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the ground</span>
<span class="s0">for the sick man, and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for</span>
<span class="s0">both of them.</span>

<span class="s0">The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his</span>
<span class="s0">head wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.</span>

<span class="s0">When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and</span>
<span class="s0">resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire,</span>
<span class="s0">looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally</span>
<span class="s0">he emitted a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel,</span>
<span class="s0">pointing to his shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact</span>
<span class="s0">that Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer</span>
<span class="s0">who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would</span>
<span class="s0">not take a French officer into his hut to warm him, and when the</span>
<span class="s0">messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to</span>
<span class="s0">be brought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He rose and tried to walk,</span>
<span class="s0">but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held</span>
<span class="s0">him up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You won't do it again, eh?&quot; said one of the soldiers, winking and</span>
<span class="s0">turning mockingly to Ramballe.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are--a real peasant!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.</span>

<span class="s0">They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two</span>
<span class="s0">soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around</span>
<span class="s0">their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh,</span>
<span class="s0">my brave, kind friends,&quot; and he leaned his head against the shoulder</span>
<span class="s0">of one of the men like a child.</span>

<span class="s0">Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire,</span>
<span class="s0">surrounded by the soldiers.</span>

<span class="s0">Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes,</span>
<span class="s0">was wearing a woman's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round</span>
<span class="s0">his head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a</span>
<span class="s0">French song in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the</span>
<span class="s0">nearest soldier. The soldiers simply held their sides as they</span>
<span class="s0">watched him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I'll soon pick it up. How</span>
<span class="s0">is it?&quot; said the man--a singer and a wag--whom Morel was embracing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!&quot; sang Morel, winking. &quot;Ce</span>
<span class="s0">diable a quatre...&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*&quot;Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy devil.&quot;</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;Vivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!&quot; repeated the soldier,</span>
<span class="s0">flourishing his arm and really catching the tune.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!&quot; rose their rough, joyous laughter from all</span>
<span class="s0">sides.</span>

<span class="s0">Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, go on, go on!&quot;</span>

    <span class="s0">&quot;Qui eut le triple talent,</span>
    <span class="s0">De boire, de battre,</span>
    <span class="s0">Et d'etre un vert galant.&quot;*</span>


<span class="s0">*Who had a triple talent</span>

 <span class="s0">For drinking, for fighting,</span>

 <span class="s0">And for being a gallant old boy...</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zaletaev!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Ke...&quot; Zaletaev, brought out with effort: &quot;ke-e-e-e,&quot; he drawled,</span>
<span class="s0">laboriously pursing his lips, &quot;le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e</span>
<span class="s0">de-tra-va-ga-la&quot; he sang.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to</span>
<span class="s0">eat?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after</span>
<span class="s0">starving.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to</span>
<span class="s0">work on his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they</span>
<span class="s0">watched him. The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse</span>
<span class="s0">themselves with such nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side</span>
<span class="s0">of the fire, but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow</span>
<span class="s0">and glance at Morel with a smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They are men too,&quot; said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his</span>
<span class="s0">coat. &quot;Even wormwood grows on its own root.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard</span>
<span class="s0">frost....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was</span>
<span class="s0">looking at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now</span>
<span class="s0">flaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering</span>
<span class="s0">something gladsome and mysterious to one another.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER X</span>


<span class="s0">The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical</span>
<span class="s0">progression; and that crossing of the Berezina about which so much has</span>
<span class="s0">been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and</span>
<span class="s0">not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been</span>
<span class="s0">and still is written about the Berezina, on the French side this is</span>
<span class="s0">only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities</span>
<span class="s0">their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated</span>
<span class="s0">at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory,</span>
<span class="s0">and on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg--far from the</span>
<span class="s0">seat of war--a plan (again one of Pfuel's) had been devised to catch</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon in a strategic trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured</span>
<span class="s0">himself that all would happen according to plan, and therefore</span>
<span class="s0">insisted that it was just the crossing of the Berezina that</span>
<span class="s0">destroyed the French army. In reality the results of the crossing were</span>
<span class="s0">much less disastrous to the French--in guns and men lost--than Krasnoe</span>
<span class="s0">had been, as the figures show.</span>

<span class="s0">The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in the fact</span>
<span class="s0">that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans</span>
<span class="s0">for cutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the only</span>
<span class="s0">possible line of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the</span>
<span class="s0">army demanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd</span>
<span class="s0">fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed</span>
<span class="s0">to reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was</span>
<span class="s0">impossible to block its path. This was shown not so much by the</span>
<span class="s0">arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the</span>
<span class="s0">bridges. When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow and women with children who were with the French transport,</span>
<span class="s0">all--carried on by vis inertiae--pressed forward into boats and into</span>
<span class="s0">the ice-covered water and did not, surrender.</span>

<span class="s0">That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of</span>
<span class="s0">pursuers was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own</span>
<span class="s0">people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite</span>
<span class="s0">place he held among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining</span>
<span class="s0">in the same pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share</span>
<span class="s0">in the necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed</span>
<span class="s0">of the fact that half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not</span>
<span class="s0">know what to do--perished of cold and hunger despite their captors'</span>
<span class="s0">desire to save them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The</span>
<span class="s0">most compassionate Russian commanders, those favorable to the</span>
<span class="s0">French--and even the Frenchmen in the Russian service--could do</span>
<span class="s0">nothing for the prisoners. The French perished from the conditions</span>
<span class="s0">to which the Russian army was itself exposed. It was impossible to</span>
<span class="s0">take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to</span>
<span class="s0">give to the French who, though not harmful, or hated, or guilty,</span>
<span class="s0">were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but they were</span>
<span class="s0">exceptions.</span>

<span class="s0">Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was</span>
<span class="s0">hope. Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in</span>
<span class="s0">collective flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was</span>
<span class="s0">concentrated.</span>

<span class="s0">The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the</span>
<span class="s0">remnant, especially after the Berezina, on which (in consequence of</span>
<span class="s0">the Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians,</span>
<span class="s0">and the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, blamed one</span>
<span class="s0">another and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of</span>
<span class="s0">the Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov led to</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly</span>
<span class="s0">expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a</span>
<span class="s0">respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to</span>
<span class="s0">blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or</span>
<span class="s0">asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable</span>
<span class="s0">formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at</span>
<span class="s0">every turn.</span>

<span class="s0">Because they could not understand him all these people assumed</span>
<span class="s0">that it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never</span>
<span class="s0">grasp the profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his</span>
<span class="s0">phrases (which they thought were mere phrases) about a &quot;golden</span>
<span class="s0">bridge,&quot; about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd</span>
<span class="s0">of tatterdemalions, and so forth. They had heard all that before.</span>
<span class="s0">And all he said--that it was necessary to await provisions, or that</span>
<span class="s0">the men had no boots--was so simple, while what they proposed was so</span>
<span class="s0">complicated and clever, that it was evident that he was old and stupid</span>
<span class="s0">and that they, though not in power, were commanders of genius.</span>

<span class="s0">After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff</span>
<span class="s0">reached their maximum. Kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged</span>
<span class="s0">his shoulders. Only once, after the affair of the Berezina, did he get</span>
<span class="s0">angry and write to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor) the following letter:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency</span>
<span class="s0">please be so good as to set off for Kaluga on receipt of this, and</span>
<span class="s0">there await further commands and appointments from His Imperial</span>
<span class="s0">Majesty.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But after Bennigsen's departure, the Grand Duke Tsarevich</span>
<span class="s0">Constantine Pavlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the</span>
<span class="s0">beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the</span>
<span class="s0">army by Kutuzov. Now having come to the army, he informed Kutuzov of</span>
<span class="s0">the Emperor's displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the</span>
<span class="s0">slowness of their advance. The Emperor intended to join the army</span>
<span class="s0">personally in a few days' time.</span>

<span class="s0">The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs-</span>
<span class="s0">this same Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief</span>
<span class="s0">against the sovereign's wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke</span>
<span class="s0">and heir--apparent from the army--who on his own authority and</span>
<span class="s0">contrary to the Emperor's will had decided on the abandonment of</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, now realized at once that his day was over, that his part</span>
<span class="s0">was played, and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer</span>
<span class="s0">his. And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court.</span>
<span class="s0">He saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had</span>
<span class="s0">played his part was ended and felt that his mission was</span>
<span class="s0">accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious of the</span>
<span class="s0">physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical</span>
<span class="s0">rest.</span>

<span class="s0">On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his &quot;dear</span>
<span class="s0">Vilna&quot; as he called it. Twice during his career Kutuzov had been</span>
<span class="s0">governor of Vilna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured,</span>
<span class="s0">he found old friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of</span>
<span class="s0">which he had so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the</span>
<span class="s0">cares of army and state and, as far as the passions that seethed</span>
<span class="s0">around him allowed, immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had</span>
<span class="s0">formerly been accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that</span>
<span class="s0">had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at</span>
<span class="s0">all.</span>

<span class="s0">Chichagov, one of the most zealous &quot;cutters-off&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;breakers-up,&quot; who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece</span>
<span class="s0">and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent:</span>
<span class="s0">Chichagov, noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to him</span>
<span class="s0">because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811</span>
<span class="s0">independently of Kutuzov, and found that peace had already been</span>
<span class="s0">concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing</span>
<span class="s0">that peace was really Kutuzov's; this Chichagov was the first to</span>
<span class="s0">meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress</span>
<span class="s0">naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he</span>
<span class="s0">handed Kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The</span>
<span class="s0">contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man</span>
<span class="s0">in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of</span>
<span class="s0">Chichagov, who knew of the accusations that were being directed</span>
<span class="s0">against Kutuzov.</span>

<span class="s0">When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentally mentioned that</span>
<span class="s0">the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at</span>
<span class="s0">Borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the</span>
<span class="s0">contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give</span>
<span class="s0">dinner parties,&quot; warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word</span>
<span class="s0">he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov</span>
<span class="s0">to be animated by the same desire.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle</span>
<span class="s0">penetrating smile: &quot;I meant merely to say what I said.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Contrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov detained the greater part</span>
<span class="s0">of the army at Vilna. Those about him said that he became</span>
<span class="s0">extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that</span>
<span class="s0">town. He attended to army affairs reluctantly, left everything to</span>
<span class="s0">his generals, and while awaiting the Emperor's arrival led a</span>
<span class="s0">dissipated life.</span>

<span class="s0">Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite-</span>
<span class="s0">Count Tolstoy, Prince Volkonski, Arakcheev, and others--the Emperor</span>
<span class="s0">reached Vilna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove</span>
<span class="s0">straight to the castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred</span>
<span class="s0">generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of</span>
<span class="s0">the castle, as well as a guard of honor of the Semenov regiment.</span>

<span class="s0">A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with</span>
<span class="s0">three foam-flecked horses, shouted &quot;Coming!&quot; and Konovnitsyn rushed</span>
<span class="s0">into the vestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was waiting in the hall</span>
<span class="s0">porter's little lodge.</span>

<span class="s0">A minute later the old man's large stout figure in full-dress</span>
<span class="s0">uniform, his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his</span>
<span class="s0">stomach, waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its</span>
<span class="s0">peaks to the sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking</span>
<span class="s0">with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street,</span>
<span class="s0">took in his hand the report he had prepared for the Emperor.</span>

<span class="s0">There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka</span>
<span class="s0">furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh</span>
<span class="s0">in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be</span>
<span class="s0">descried.</span>

<span class="s0">From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating</span>
<span class="s0">effect on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all</span>
<span class="s0">over, readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up</span>
<span class="s0">and, at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the</span>
<span class="s0">sleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began</span>
<span class="s0">speaking in his smooth, ingratiating voice.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head to foot,</span>
<span class="s0">frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to</span>
<span class="s0">the old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too,</span>
<span class="s0">owing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings,</span>
<span class="s0">had its usual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob.</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and again</span>
<span class="s0">pressing the old man's hand went with him into the castle.</span>

<span class="s0">When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his</span>
<span class="s0">dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes</span>
<span class="s0">made at Krasnoe and the Berezina, and informed him of his intentions</span>
<span class="s0">for a future campaign abroad. Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark. The</span>
<span class="s0">same submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor's commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before</span>
<span class="s0">settled on his face now.</span>

<span class="s0">When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was</span>
<span class="s0">crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by</span>
<span class="s0">someone's voice saying:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Your Serene Highness!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of</span>
<span class="s0">Count Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which</span>
<span class="s0">lay a small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected</span>
<span class="s0">of him.</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed</span>
<span class="s0">across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the</span>
<span class="s0">object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the</span>
<span class="s0">First Class.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>


<span class="s0">Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor honored by his presence. Kutuzov had received the Order of St.</span>
<span class="s0">George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest</span>
<span class="s0">honors, but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him.</span>
<span class="s0">The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set</span>
<span class="s0">that example, but everybody understood that the old man was</span>
<span class="s0">blameworthy and good-for-nothing. When Kutuzov, conforming to a custom</span>
<span class="s0">of Catherine's day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be</span>
<span class="s0">lowered at the Emperor's feet on his entering the ballroom, the</span>
<span class="s0">Emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people</span>
<span class="s0">caught the words, &quot;the old comedian.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The Emperor's displeasure with Kutuzov was specially increased at</span>
<span class="s0">Vilna by the fact that Kutuzov evidently could not or would not</span>
<span class="s0">understand the importance of the coming campaign.</span>

<span class="s0">When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers</span>
<span class="s0">assembled about him: &quot;You have not only saved Russia, you have saved</span>
<span class="s0">Europe!&quot; they all understood that the war was not ended.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion</span>
<span class="s0">that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of</span>
<span class="s0">Russia, but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that</span>
<span class="s0">Russia had gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the</span>
<span class="s0">impossibility of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hardships</span>
<span class="s0">already endured by the people, of the possibility of failure and so</span>
<span class="s0">forth.</span>

<span class="s0">This being the field marshal's frame of mind he was naturally</span>
<span class="s0">regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.</span>

<span class="s0">To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural</span>
<span class="s0">method was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with</span>
<span class="s0">Barclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign--to transfer the</span>
<span class="s0">authority to the Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under</span>
<span class="s0">the commander in chief's feet without upsetting the old man by</span>
<span class="s0">informing him of the change.</span>

<span class="s0">With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its</span>
<span class="s0">real strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll,</span>
<span class="s0">Konovnitsyn, and Ermolov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke</span>
<span class="s0">loudly of the field marshal's great weakness and failing health.</span>

<span class="s0">His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to</span>
<span class="s0">another. And in fact his health was poor.</span>

<span class="s0">So naturally, simply, and gradually--just as he had come from Turkey</span>
<span class="s0">to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to</span>
<span class="s0">the army when he was needed there--now when his part was played out,</span>
<span class="s0">Kutuzov's place was taken by a new and necessary performer.</span>

<span class="s0">The war 1812, besides its national significance dear to every</span>
<span class="s0">Russian heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.</span>

<span class="s0">The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a</span>
<span class="s0">movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war</span>
<span class="s0">another leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing</span>
<span class="s0">from Kutuzov's and animated by different motives.</span>

<span class="s0">Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from</span>
<span class="s0">east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov had</span>
<span class="s0">been for the salvation and glory of Russia.</span>

<span class="s0">Kutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative</span>
<span class="s0">of the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia</span>
<span class="s0">had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was</span>
<span class="s0">nothing left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the</span>
<span class="s0">representative of the national war but to die, and Kutuzov died.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>


<span class="s0">As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the</span>
<span class="s0">physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until</span>
<span class="s0">after they were over. After his liberation he reached Orel, and on the</span>
<span class="s0">third day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was</span>
<span class="s0">laid up for three months. He had what the doctors termed &quot;bilious</span>
<span class="s0">fever.&quot; But despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him,</span>
<span class="s0">and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.</span>

<span class="s0">Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre's mind by all that</span>
<span class="s0">happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He</span>
<span class="s0">remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy,</span>
<span class="s0">internal physical distress, and pains in his feet and side. He</span>
<span class="s0">remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of</span>
<span class="s0">people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and</span>
<span class="s0">generals who questioned him, he also remembered his difficulty in</span>
<span class="s0">procuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he remembered his</span>
<span class="s0">incapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of his rescue</span>
<span class="s0">he had seen the body of Petya Rostov. That same day he had learned</span>
<span class="s0">that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodino for more</span>
<span class="s0">than a month had recently died in the Rostovs' house at Yaroslavl, and</span>
<span class="s0">Denisov who told him this news also mentioned Helene's death,</span>
<span class="s0">supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at the</span>
<span class="s0">time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its</span>
<span class="s0">significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly</span>
<span class="s0">as possible from places where people were killing one another, to some</span>
<span class="s0">peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over</span>
<span class="s0">all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orel he</span>
<span class="s0">immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw</span>
<span class="s0">in attendance on him two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had</span>
<span class="s0">come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had</span>
<span class="s0">been living on his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and</span>
<span class="s0">illness had come to look after him.</span>

<span class="s0">It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost</span>
<span class="s0">the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months</span>
<span class="s0">and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he</span>
<span class="s0">would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of</span>
<span class="s0">captivity. In the same way little by little he came to understand</span>
<span class="s0">the news he had been told after his rescue, about the death of</span>
<span class="s0">Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the destruction of the</span>
<span class="s0">French.</span>

<span class="s0">A joyous feeling of freedom--that complete inalienable freedom</span>
<span class="s0">natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt</span>
<span class="s0">outside Moscow--filled Pierre's soul during his convalescence. He</span>
<span class="s0">was surprised to find that this inner freedom, which was independent</span>
<span class="s0">of external conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of</span>
<span class="s0">external liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintances. No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere.</span>
<span class="s0">He had all he wanted: the thought of his wife which had been a</span>
<span class="s0">continual torment to him was no longer there, since she was no more.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Oh, how good! How splendid!&quot; said he to himself when a cleanly laid</span>
<span class="s0">table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down</span>
<span class="s0">for the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the</span>
<span class="s0">French had gone and that his wife was no more. &quot;Oh, how good, how</span>
<span class="s0">splendid!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And by old habit he asked himself the question: &quot;Well, and what</span>
<span class="s0">then? What am I going to do?&quot; And he immediately gave himself the</span>
<span class="s0">answer: &quot;Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he</span>
<span class="s0">had continually sought to find--the aim of life--no longer existed for</span>
<span class="s0">him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared</span>
<span class="s0">temporarily--he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not</span>
<span class="s0">present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the</span>
<span class="s0">complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at</span>
<span class="s0">this time.</span>

<span class="s0">He could not see an aim, for he now had faith--not faith in any kind</span>
<span class="s0">of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living,</span>
<span class="s0">ever-manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set</span>
<span class="s0">himself. That search for an aim had been simply a search for God,</span>
<span class="s0">and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning</span>
<span class="s0">but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God</span>
<span class="s0">is here and everywhere. In his captivity he had learned that in</span>
<span class="s0">Karataev God was greater, more infinite and unfathomable than in the</span>
<span class="s0">Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons. He felt like a</span>
<span class="s0">man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds</span>
<span class="s0">what he sought at his very feet. All his life he had looked over the</span>
<span class="s0">heads of the men around him, when he should have merely looked in</span>
<span class="s0">front of him without straining his eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable</span>
<span class="s0">infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere</span>
<span class="s0">and had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had</span>
<span class="s0">only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had</span>
<span class="s0">equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,</span>
<span class="s0">where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen.</span>
<span class="s0">And such had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and</span>
<span class="s0">philanthropy seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as</span>
<span class="s0">he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those distances</span>
<span class="s0">and he had there seen the same pettiness, worldliness, and</span>
<span class="s0">senselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the great, eternal,</span>
<span class="s0">and infinite in everything, and therefore--to see it and enjoy its</span>
<span class="s0">contemplation--he naturally threw away the telescope through which</span>
<span class="s0">he had till now gazed over men's heads, and gladly regarded the</span>
<span class="s0">ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around</span>
<span class="s0">him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became.</span>
<span class="s0">That dreadful question, &quot;What for?&quot; which had formerly destroyed all</span>
<span class="s0">his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;What for?&quot; a simple answer was now always ready in his soul: &quot;Because</span>
<span class="s0">there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls from</span>
<span class="s0">a man's head.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIII</span>


<span class="s0">In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance</span>
<span class="s0">he was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and</span>
<span class="s0">seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something</span>
<span class="s0">special of his own. The difference between his former and present self</span>
<span class="s0">was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was</span>
<span class="s0">said to him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly</span>
<span class="s0">seeking to distinguish something at a distance. At present he still</span>
<span class="s0">forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes, but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and</span>
<span class="s0">seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was</span>
<span class="s0">said, though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different.</span>
<span class="s0">Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so</span>
<span class="s0">people had been inclined to avoid him. Now a smile at the joy of</span>
<span class="s0">life always played round his lips, and sympathy for others, shone in</span>
<span class="s0">his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as</span>
<span class="s0">contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his presence.</span>

<span class="s0">Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he</span>
<span class="s0">talked, and seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in</span>
<span class="s0">conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him</span>
<span class="s0">their most intimate secrets.</span>

<span class="s0">The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly</span>
<span class="s0">hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him</span>
<span class="s0">after the old count's death, now after staying a short time in Orel-</span>
<span class="s0">where she had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his</span>
<span class="s0">ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him--felt to her</span>
<span class="s0">surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him. Pierre did</span>
<span class="s0">not in any way seek her approval, he merely studied her with interest.</span>
<span class="s0">Formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and</span>
<span class="s0">irony, and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had</span>
<span class="s0">shown him only the combative side of her nature; but now he seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart, and,</span>
<span class="s0">mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully, she let him see</span>
<span class="s0">the hidden, kindly sides of her character.</span>

<span class="s0">The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more</span>
<span class="s0">successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and</span>
<span class="s0">showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's cunning consisted simply in</span>
<span class="s0">finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,</span>
<span class="s0">hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence</span>
<span class="s0">of bad people but of people such as myself,&quot; thought she.</span>

<span class="s0">His servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticed the</span>
<span class="s0">change that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had</span>
<span class="s0">become much &quot;simpler.&quot; Terenty, when he had helped him undress and</span>
<span class="s0">wished him good night, often lingered with his master's boots in his</span>
<span class="s0">hands and clothes over his arm, to see whether he would not start a</span>
<span class="s0">talk. And Pierre, noticing that Terenty wanted a chat, generally</span>
<span class="s0">kept him there.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?&quot; he would ask.</span>

<span class="s0">And Terenty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of</span>
<span class="s0">the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and</span>
<span class="s0">talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre's stories, and then would go</span>
<span class="s0">out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master</span>
<span class="s0">and affection for him.</span>

<span class="s0">The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though</span>
<span class="s0">he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every</span>
<span class="s0">moment was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on</span>
<span class="s0">the characters of his patients in general, and especially of the</span>
<span class="s0">ladies.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our</span>
<span class="s0">provincials,&quot; he would say.</span>

<span class="s0">There were several prisoners from the French army in Orel, and the</span>
<span class="s0">doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make</span>
<span class="s0">fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.</span>

<span class="s0">The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk</span>
<span class="s0">with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love, and</span>
<span class="s0">pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially</span>
<span class="s0">against Napoleon.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight</span>
<span class="s0">such a nation,&quot; he said to Pierre. &quot;You, who have suffered so from the</span>
<span class="s0">French, do not even feel animosity toward them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely</span>
<span class="s0">by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so</span>
<span class="s0">doing.</span>

<span class="s0">During the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel his old Masonic</span>
<span class="s0">acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in</span>
<span class="s0">1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress</span>
<span class="s0">who had a large estate in Orel province, and he occupied a temporary</span>
<span class="s0">post in the commissariat department in that town.</span>

<span class="s0">Hearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they had</span>
<span class="s0">never been intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship</span>
<span class="s0">and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for</span>
<span class="s0">one another. Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man</span>
<span class="s0">of his own circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.</span>

<span class="s0">But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged</span>
<span class="s0">much behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself,</span>
<span class="s0">into apathy and egotism.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had</span>
<span class="s0">been formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to</span>
<span class="s0">think that he had been like that himself but a short time before.</span>

<span class="s0">Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family</span>
<span class="s0">affairs, his wife's affairs, and his official duties. He regarded</span>
<span class="s0">all these occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that</span>
<span class="s0">they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of</span>
<span class="s0">himself and his family. Military, administrative, political, and</span>
<span class="s0">Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">without trying to change the other's views and without condemning him,</span>
<span class="s0">but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him,</span>
<span class="s0">was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon.</span>

<span class="s0">There was a new feature in Pierre's relations with Willarski, with</span>
<span class="s0">the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met,</span>
<span class="s0">which gained for him the general good will. This was his</span>
<span class="s0">acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man's convictions by</span>
<span class="s0">words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking,</span>
<span class="s0">feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view. This</span>
<span class="s0">legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and</span>
<span class="s0">irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and</span>
<span class="s0">the interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">complete contradiction, between men's opinions and their lives, and</span>
<span class="s0">between one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused</span>
<span class="s0">and gentle smile.</span>

<span class="s0">In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a</span>
<span class="s0">center of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary</span>
<span class="s0">questions, especially requests for money to which, as an extremely</span>
<span class="s0">wealthy man, he was very exposed, produced in him a state of</span>
<span class="s0">hopeless agitation and perplexity. &quot;To give or not to give?&quot; he had</span>
<span class="s0">asked himself. &quot;I have it and he needs it. But someone else needs it</span>
<span class="s0">still more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they are both impostors?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">In the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these</span>
<span class="s0">surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything</span>
<span class="s0">to give. Formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with</span>
<span class="s0">regard to every question concerning his property, when one person</span>
<span class="s0">advised one thing and another something else.</span>

<span class="s0">Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt</span>
<span class="s0">or perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a</span>
<span class="s0">judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should</span>
<span class="s0">not be done.</span>

<span class="s0">He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he</span>
<span class="s0">felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first</span>
<span class="s0">time he had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a</span>
<span class="s0">colonel, came to him and, after talking a great deal about his</span>
<span class="s0">exploits, concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children.</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was</span>
<span class="s0">afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to</span>
<span class="s0">appear so insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused</span>
<span class="s0">the colonel's demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to</span>
<span class="s0">artifice when leaving Orel, to induce the Italian officer to accept</span>
<span class="s0">some money of which he was evidently in need. A further proof to</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was</span>
<span class="s0">furnished by his decision with regard to his wife's debts and to the</span>
<span class="s0">rebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow.</span>

<span class="s0">His head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoned up with him</span>
<span class="s0">his diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according</span>
<span class="s0">to the head steward's calculation, about two million rubles.</span>

<span class="s0">To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an</span>
<span class="s0">estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be</span>
<span class="s0">diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife's</span>
<span class="s0">debts which he was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild</span>
<span class="s0">his Moscow house and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had</span>
<span class="s0">cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, of course that's true,&quot; said Pierre with a cheerful smile.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;I don't need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much</span>
<span class="s0">richer.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">But in January Savelich came from Moscow and gave him an account</span>
<span class="s0">of the state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect</span>
<span class="s0">had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses,</span>
<span class="s0">speaking of this as of a settled matter. About the same time he</span>
<span class="s0">received letters from Prince Vasili and other Petersburg acquaintances</span>
<span class="s0">speaking of his wife's debts. And Pierre decided that the steward's</span>
<span class="s0">proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg and settle his wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow.</span>
<span class="s0">Why this was necessary he did not know, but he knew for certain that</span>
<span class="s0">it was necessary. His income would be reduced by three fourths, but he</span>
<span class="s0">felt it must be done.</span>

<span class="s0">Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.</span>

<span class="s0">During the whole time of his convalescence in Orel Pierre had</span>
<span class="s0">experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his</span>
<span class="s0">journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new</span>
<span class="s0">faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt</span>
<span class="s0">like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone--the stagecoach driver, the</span>
<span class="s0">post-house overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villages-</span>
<span class="s0">had a new significance for him. The presence and remarks of</span>
<span class="s0">Willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia</span>
<span class="s0">and its backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure. Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary</span>
<span class="s0">strength and vitality--the strength which in that vast space amid</span>
<span class="s0">the snows maintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique</span>
<span class="s0">people. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree</span>
<span class="s0">with him--an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid</span>
<span class="s0">discussions that could lead to nothing--and he smiled joyfully as he</span>
<span class="s0">listened to him.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>


<span class="s0">It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has</span>
<span class="s0">been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of</span>
<span class="s0">rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they</span>
<span class="s0">jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally</span>
<span class="s0">difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of</span>
<span class="s0">the French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But</span>
<span class="s0">when we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity,</span>
<span class="s0">energy, and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite</span>
<span class="s0">the destruction of the heap, something indestructible, which though</span>
<span class="s0">intangible is the real strength of the colony, still exists; and</span>
<span class="s0">similarly, though in Moscow in the month of October there was no</span>
<span class="s0">government no churches, shrines, riches, or houses--it was still the</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow it had been in August. All was destroyed, except something</span>
<span class="s0">intangible yet powerful and indestructible.</span>

<span class="s0">The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after</span>
<span class="s0">it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and</span>
<span class="s0">at first for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all</span>
<span class="s0">had in common: a desire to get to the place that had been called</span>
<span class="s0">Moscow, to apply their activities there.</span>

<span class="s0">Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in</span>
<span class="s0">a fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the</span>
<span class="s0">number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in</span>
<span class="s0">1812.</span>

<span class="s0">The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of</span>
<span class="s0">Wintzingerode's detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and</span>
<span class="s0">residents who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its</span>
<span class="s0">vicinity. The Russians who entered Moscow, finding it plundered,</span>
<span class="s0">plundered it in their turn. They continued what the French had</span>
<span class="s0">begun. Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the</span>
<span class="s0">villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets.</span>
<span class="s0">The Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps, and the</span>
<span class="s0">householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it</span>
<span class="s0">to their own, pretending that it was their property.</span>

<span class="s0">But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third</span>
<span class="s0">contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and</span>
<span class="s0">more difficult and assumed more definite forms.</span>

<span class="s0">The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations</span>
<span class="s0">of regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and</span>
<span class="s0">craftsmanship, with luxury, and governmental and religious</span>
<span class="s0">institutions. These forms were lifeless but still existed. There</span>
<span class="s0">were bazaars, shops, warehouses, market stalls, granaries--for the</span>
<span class="s0">most part still stocked with goods--and there were factories and</span>
<span class="s0">workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals,</span>
<span class="s0">prisons, government offices, churches, and cathedrals. The longer</span>
<span class="s0">the French remained the more these forms of town life perished,</span>
<span class="s0">until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless scene of</span>
<span class="s0">plunder.</span>

<span class="s0">The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the</span>
<span class="s0">wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But</span>
<span class="s0">plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city</span>
<span class="s0">began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater</span>
<span class="s0">the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth</span>
<span class="s0">of the city and its regular life restored.</span>

<span class="s0">Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by</span>
<span class="s0">curiosity, some by official duties, some by self-interest--house</span>
<span class="s0">owners, clergy, officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and</span>
<span class="s0">peasants--streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart.</span>

<span class="s0">Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off</span>
<span class="s0">plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses</span>
<span class="s0">out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades'</span>
<span class="s0">discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat</span>
<span class="s0">down one another's prices to below what they had been in former</span>
<span class="s0">days. Gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow</span>
<span class="s0">every day, and on all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built,</span>
<span class="s0">and old, charred ones repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths.</span>
<span class="s0">Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses. The</span>
<span class="s0">clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned.</span>
<span class="s0">Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen. Government</span>
<span class="s0">clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of</span>
<span class="s0">documents in small rooms. The higher authorities and the police</span>
<span class="s0">organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French. The</span>
<span class="s0">owners of houses in which much property had been left, brought there</span>
<span class="s0">from other houses, complained of the injustice of taking everything to</span>
<span class="s0">the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin; others insisted that as the</span>
<span class="s0">French had gathered things from different houses into this or that</span>
<span class="s0">house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was</span>
<span class="s0">found there. They abused the police and bribed them, made out</span>
<span class="s0">estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had</span>
<span class="s0">perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchin</span>
<span class="s0">wrote proclamations.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>


<span class="s0">At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex</span>
<span class="s0">of his house which had not been burned. He called on Count</span>
<span class="s0">Rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he</span>
<span class="s0">intended to leave for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was</span>
<span class="s0">celebrating the victory, everything was bubbling with life in the</span>
<span class="s0">ruined but reviving city. Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone</span>
<span class="s0">wished to meet him, and everyone questioned him about what he had</span>
<span class="s0">seen. Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all, but</span>
<span class="s0">was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in</span>
<span class="s0">any way. To all questions put to him--whether important or quite</span>
<span class="s0">trifling--such as: Where would he live? Was he going to rebuild?</span>
<span class="s0">When was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel</span>
<span class="s0">for someone?--he replied: &quot;Yes, perhaps,&quot; or, &quot;I think so,&quot; and so on.</span>

<span class="s0">He had heard that the Rostovs were at Kostroma but the thought of</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant</span>
<span class="s0">memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from</span>
<span class="s0">social obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him,</span>
<span class="s0">he had aroused in himself.</span>

<span class="s0">On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskoys</span>
<span class="s0">that Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days</span>
<span class="s0">of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's thoughts and now recurred</span>
<span class="s0">to him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">was in Moscow and living in her house--which had not been burned--in</span>
<span class="s0">Vozdvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.</span>

<span class="s0">On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of</span>
<span class="s0">their friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially</span>
<span class="s0">of the last one at Borodino.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then</span>
<span class="s0">in? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him</span>
<span class="s0">before he died?&quot; thought Pierre. He recalled Karataev and his death</span>
<span class="s0">and involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and</span>
<span class="s0">yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the</span>
<span class="s0">love he felt for both of them.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious</span>
<span class="s0">mood. The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but</span>
<span class="s0">its general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with</span>
<span class="s0">a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence</span>
<span class="s0">of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the</span>
<span class="s0">house, informed him that the princess had gone to her own</span>
<span class="s0">apartments, and that she received on Sundays.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,&quot; said Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the man. &quot;Please step into the portrait gallery.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought</span>
<span class="s0">word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he</span>
<span class="s0">would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.</span>

<span class="s0">In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her</span>
<span class="s0">another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess</span>
<span class="s0">always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were</span>
<span class="s0">like he never knew or remembered. &quot;This must be one of her</span>
<span class="s0">companions,&quot; he thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.</span>

<span class="s0">The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her</span>
<span class="s0">hand, &quot;so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the</span>
<span class="s0">very last,&quot; she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion</span>
<span class="s0">with a shyness that surprised him for an instant.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of</span>
<span class="s0">good news we had received for a long time.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more</span>
<span class="s0">uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">interrupted her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Just imagine--I knew nothing about him!&quot; said he. &quot;I thought he had</span>
<span class="s0">been killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only</span>
<span class="s0">know that he fell in with the Rostovs.... What a strange coincidence!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the</span>
<span class="s0">companion's face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,</span>
<span class="s0">as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion</span>
<span class="s0">in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would</span>
<span class="s0">not hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">But when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expressed</span>
<span class="s0">still greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">face to that of the lady in the black dress and said:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you really not recognize her?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked again at the companion's pale, delicate face with</span>
<span class="s0">its black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long</span>
<span class="s0">forgotten and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive</span>
<span class="s0">eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But no, it can't be!&quot; he thought. &quot;This stern, thin, pale face that</span>
<span class="s0">looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">But at that moment Princess Mary said, &quot;Natasha!&quot; And with difficulty,</span>
<span class="s0">effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its</span>
<span class="s0">hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from</span>
<span class="s0">that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even</span>
<span class="s0">been thinking--especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him,</span>
<span class="s0">and enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer</span>
<span class="s0">possible, it was Natasha and he loved her.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary, and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had</span>
<span class="s0">been unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He</span>
<span class="s0">tried to hide his agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more</span>
<span class="s0">clearly--clearer than any words could have done--did he betray to</span>
<span class="s0">himself, to her, and to Princess Mary that he loved her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, it's only the unexpectedness of it,&quot; thought Pierre. But as</span>
<span class="s0">soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush</span>
<span class="s0">suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and</span>
<span class="s0">fear seized his soul. He became confused in his speech and stopped</span>
<span class="s0">in the middle of what he was saying.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not at all expect</span>
<span class="s0">to see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the</span>
<span class="s0">change in her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin</span>
<span class="s0">and pale, but that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was</span>
<span class="s0">unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose</span>
<span class="s0">eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life,</span>
<span class="s0">now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least</span>
<span class="s0">shadow of a smile: only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly</span>
<span class="s0">interrogative.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's</span>
<span class="s0">part, but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her</span>
<span class="s0">whole face.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVI</span>


<span class="s0">&quot;She has come to stay with me,&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;The count and</span>
<span class="s0">countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful</span>
<span class="s0">state; but it was necessary for Natasha herself to see a doctor.</span>
<span class="s0">They insisted on her coming with me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?&quot; said Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">addressing Natasha. &quot;You know it happened the very day we were</span>
<span class="s0">rescued. I saw him. What a delightful boy he was!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes</span>
<span class="s0">widened and lit up.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What can one say or think of as a consolation?&quot; said Pierre.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing! Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">remarked Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, that is really true,&quot; Pierre hastily interrupted her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Why is it true?&quot; Natasha asked, looking attentively into Pierre's</span>
<span class="s0">eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How can you ask why?&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;The thought alone of</span>
<span class="s0">what awaits...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked</span>
<span class="s0">inquiringly at Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And because,&quot; Pierre continued, &quot;only one who believes that there</span>
<span class="s0">is a God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">stopped. Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary, asking about his friend's last days.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time</span>
<span class="s0">he felt that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that</span>
<span class="s0">there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment</span>
<span class="s0">mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world. As he</span>
<span class="s0">spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. He did not purposely say things to please her, but whatever</span>
<span class="s0">he was saying he regarded from her standpoint.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary--reluctantly as is usual in such cases--began</span>
<span class="s0">telling of the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's face quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager</span>
<span class="s0">restless expression, gradually compelled her to go into details</span>
<span class="s0">which she feared to recall for her own sake.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, and so...?&quot; Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her</span>
<span class="s0">with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. &quot;Yes, yes... so</span>
<span class="s0">he grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always</span>
<span class="s0">sought one thing--to be perfectly good--so he could not be afraid of</span>
<span class="s0">death. The faults he had--if he had any--were not of his making. So he</span>
<span class="s0">did soften?... What a happy thing that he saw you again,&quot; he added,</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly turning to Natasha and looking at her with eyes full of</span>
<span class="s0">tears.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha's face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a</span>
<span class="s0">moment. She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, that was happiness,&quot; she then said in her quiet voice with its</span>
<span class="s0">deep chest notes. &quot;For me it certainly was happiness.&quot; She paused.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;And he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I</span>
<span class="s0">entered the room....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her</span>
<span class="s0">knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted</span>
<span class="s0">her head and began to speak rapidly.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare</span>
<span class="s0">to ask about him. Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with</span>
<span class="s0">us. I had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I</span>
<span class="s0">wanted was to see him and be with him,&quot; she said, trembling, and</span>
<span class="s0">breathing quickly.</span>

<span class="s0">And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she</span>
<span class="s0">had never yet mentioned to anyone--all she had lived through during</span>
<span class="s0">those three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslavl.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full</span>
<span class="s0">of tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of</span>
<span class="s0">death, nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only</span>
<span class="s0">pity for her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat</span>
<span class="s0">beside Natasha, and heard for the first time the story of those last</span>
<span class="s0">days of her brother's and Natasha's love.</span>

<span class="s0">Evidently Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.</span>

<span class="s0">She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate</span>
<span class="s0">secrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish.</span>
<span class="s0">Several times she repeated the same thing twice.</span>

<span class="s0">Dessalles' voice was heard outside the door asking whether little</span>
<span class="s0">Nicholas might come in to say good night.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, that's all--everything,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the</span>
<span class="s0">door which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and</span>
<span class="s0">rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did</span>
<span class="s0">not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his</span>
<span class="s0">attention to her nephew who had entered the room.</span>

<span class="s0">At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas' face, which</span>
<span class="s0">resembled his father's, affected Pierre so much that when he had</span>
<span class="s0">kissed the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and</span>
<span class="s0">went to the window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but</span>
<span class="s0">she would not let him go.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, Natasha and I sometimes don't go to sleep till after two, so</span>
<span class="s0">please don't go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come</span>
<span class="s0">immediately.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: &quot;This is the</span>
<span class="s0">first time she has talked of him like that.&quot;</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XVII</span>


<span class="s0">Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few</span>
<span class="s0">minutes later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. Natasha was calm, though a severe and grave expression had</span>
<span class="s0">again settled on her face. They all three of them now experienced that</span>
<span class="s0">feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and</span>
<span class="s0">heartfelt talk. It is impossible to go back to the same</span>
<span class="s0">conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to</span>
<span class="s0">speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went</span>
<span class="s0">silently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up</span>
<span class="s0">again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break</span>
<span class="s0">the silence, looked at Natasha and at Princess Mary. They had</span>
<span class="s0">evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with</span>
<span class="s0">satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you take vodka, Count?&quot; asked Princess Mary, and those words</span>
<span class="s0">suddenly banished the shadows of the past. &quot;Now tell us about</span>
<span class="s0">yourself,&quot; said she. &quot;One hears such improbable wonders about you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to</span>
<span class="s0">him. &quot;They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary</span>
<span class="s0">Abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had</span>
<span class="s0">happened, or ought to have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also</span>
<span class="s0">instructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I have</span>
<span class="s0">noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I am an</span>
<span class="s0">interesting man now); people invite me out and tell me all about</span>
<span class="s0">myself.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;We have been told,&quot; Princess Mary interrupted her, &quot;that you lost</span>
<span class="s0">two millions in Moscow. Is that true?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But I am three times as rich as before,&quot; returned Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his</span>
<span class="s0">wife's debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that</span>
<span class="s0">he had become three times as rich as before.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What I have certainly gained is freedom,&quot; he began seriously, but</span>
<span class="s0">did not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And are you building?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes. Savelich says I must!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when you decided</span>
<span class="s0">to remain in Moscow?&quot; asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed,</span>
<span class="s0">noticing that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed</span>
<span class="s0">to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary had given to his words. &quot;I heard of it in Orel and you</span>
<span class="s0">cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">added quickly, glancing at Natasha and noticing on her face</span>
<span class="s0">curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife, &quot;but her death shocked</span>
<span class="s0">me terribly. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault,</span>
<span class="s0">and one's own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other</span>
<span class="s0">is no longer alive. And then such a death... without friends and</span>
<span class="s0">without consolation! I am very, very sorry for her,&quot; he concluded, and</span>
<span class="s0">was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Natasha's face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to</span>
<span class="s0">look at Natasha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was</span>
<span class="s0">cold, stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been</span>
<span class="s0">told?&quot; said Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre laughed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken</span>
<span class="s0">prisoner means being Napoleon's guest. Not only did I never see him</span>
<span class="s0">but I heard nothing about him--I was in much lower company!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his</span>
<span class="s0">captivity was gradually led on to do so.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But it's true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha asked with a slight smile. &quot;I guessed it then when we met at</span>
<span class="s0">the Sukharev tower, do you remember?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary's questions and especially by Natasha's into giving a</span>
<span class="s0">detailed account of his adventures.</span>

<span class="s0">At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary</span>
<span class="s0">with him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he</span>
<span class="s0">came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was</span>
<span class="s0">unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed</span>
<span class="s0">emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he</span>
<span class="s0">has lived through.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his</span>
<span class="s0">goodness. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face</span>
<span class="s0">constantly changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an</span>
<span class="s0">attention that never wandered--evidently herself experiencing all that</span>
<span class="s0">he described. Not only her look, but her exclamations and the brief</span>
<span class="s0">questions she put, showed Pierre that she understood just what he</span>
<span class="s0">wished to convey. It was clear that she understood not only what he</span>
<span class="s0">said but also what he wished to, but could not, express in words.</span>
<span class="s0">The account Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman</span>
<span class="s0">for protecting whom he was arrested was this: &quot;It was an awful</span>
<span class="s0">sight--children abandoned, some in the flames... One was snatched</span>
<span class="s0">out before my eyes... and there were women who had their things</span>
<span class="s0">snatched off and their earrings torn out...&quot; he flushed and grew</span>
<span class="s0">confused. &quot;Then a patrol arrived and all the men--all those who were</span>

<span class="s0">not looting, that is--were arrested, and I among them.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am sure you're not telling us everything; I am sure you did</span>
<span class="s0">something...&quot; said Natasha and pausing added, &quot;something fine?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass</span>
<span class="s0">over the horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he should not</span>
<span class="s0">omit anything.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused. By this time he had</span>
<span class="s0">risen from the table and was pacing the room, Natasha following him</span>
<span class="s0">with her eyes. Then he added:</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, you can't understand what I learned from that illiterate man-</span>
<span class="s0">that simple fellow.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, go on!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Where is he?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;They killed him almost before my eyes.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of</span>
<span class="s0">the last days of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his death.</span>

<span class="s0">He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now,</span>
<span class="s0">as it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that</span>
<span class="s0">he was telling it all to Natasha he experienced that pleasure which</span>
<span class="s0">a man has when women listen to him--not clever women who when</span>
<span class="s0">listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their</span>
<span class="s0">minds and when opportunity offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt</span>
<span class="s0">it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own</span>
<span class="s0">clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop--but the</span>
<span class="s0">pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and</span>
<span class="s0">absorb the very best a man shows of himself. Natasha without knowing</span>
<span class="s0">it was all attention: she did not lose a word, no single quiver in</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre's voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor a</span>
<span class="s0">single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its flight and</span>
<span class="s0">took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret meaning of</span>
<span class="s0">all Pierre's mental travail.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she</span>
<span class="s0">now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the</span>
<span class="s0">possibility of love and happiness between Natasha and Pierre, and</span>
<span class="s0">the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.</span>

<span class="s0">It was three o'clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad</span>
<span class="s0">and stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at him intently</span>
<span class="s0">with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to</span>
<span class="s0">understand something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and</span>
<span class="s0">tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary was silent. It occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock</span>
<span class="s0">and time to go to bed.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,&quot; remarked Pierre,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;but if at this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather be what you</span>
<span class="s0">were before you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?'</span>
<span class="s0">then for heaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh!</span>
<span class="s0">We imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is</span>
<span class="s0">lost, but it is only then that what is new and good begins. While</span>
<span class="s0">there is life there is happiness. There is much, much before us. I say</span>
<span class="s0">this to you,&quot; he added, turning to Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; she said, answering something quite different. &quot;I too</span>
<span class="s0">should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre looked intently at her.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and nothing more.&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It's not true, not true!&quot; cried Pierre. &quot;I am not to blame for</span>
<span class="s0">being alive and wishing to live--nor you either.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Suddenly Natasha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and</span>
<span class="s0">began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What is it, Natasha?&quot; said Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot; She smiled at Pierre through her tears. &quot;Good</span>
<span class="s0">night! It is time for bed.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre rose and took his leave.</span>


<span class="s0">Princess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked</span>
<span class="s0">of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her</span>
<span class="s0">opinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good night, Mary!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Do you know, I am often</span>
<span class="s0">afraid that by not speaking of him&quot; (she meant Prince Andrew) &quot;for</span>
<span class="s0">fear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice</span>
<span class="s0">of Natasha's remark, but she did not express agreement in words.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it possible to forget?&quot; said she.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard</span>
<span class="s0">and painful, but good, very good!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;I am sure he</span>
<span class="s0">really loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?&quot; she</span>
<span class="s0">added, suddenly blushing.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!&quot; said</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know, Mary...&quot; Natasha suddenly said with a mischievous</span>
<span class="s0">smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long</span>
<span class="s0">time, &quot;he has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if he</span>
<span class="s0">had just come out of a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral</span>
<span class="s0">bath. Isn't it true?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Princess Mary. &quot;He has greatly improved.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as</span>
<span class="s0">if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I understand why he&quot; (Prince Andrew) &quot;liked no one so much as him,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when</span>
<span class="s0">they are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike</span>
<span class="s0">him--in everything.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, but he's wonderful.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, good night,&quot; said Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her</span>
<span class="s0">face as if it had been forgotten there.</span>

<span class="s0">It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He</span>
<span class="s0">paced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult</span>
<span class="s0">problem and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and</span>
<span class="s0">wincing, and now smiling happily.</span>

<span class="s0">He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, and of their love,</span>
<span class="s0">at one moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that</span>
<span class="s0">feeling. It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and</span>
<span class="s0">down the room.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, what's to be done if it cannot be avoided? What's to be done?</span>
<span class="s0">Evidently it has to be so,&quot; said he to himself, and hastily undressing</span>
<span class="s0">he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or</span>
<span class="s0">indecision.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do</span>
<span class="s0">everything that she and I may be man and wife,&quot; he told himself.</span>

<span class="s0">A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on</span>
<span class="s0">the Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savelich came to ask him</span>
<span class="s0">about packing for the journey.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg?&quot; he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. &quot;Oh, yes,</span>
<span class="s0">long ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to</span>
<span class="s0">Petersburg,&quot; he reflected. &quot;Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good</span>
<span class="s0">fellow he is and how attentive, and how he remembers everything,&quot; he</span>
<span class="s0">thought, looking at Savelich's old face, &quot;and what a pleasant smile he</span>
<span class="s0">has!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre asked him.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What's the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under</span>
<span class="s0">the late count--the kingdom of heaven be his!--and we have lived under</span>
<span class="s0">you too, without ever being wronged.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And your children?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;The children will live just the same. With such masters one can</span>
<span class="s0">live.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what about my heirs?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Supposing I suddenly</span>
<span class="s0">marry... it might happen,&quot; he added with an involuntary smile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good</span>
<span class="s0">thing.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How easy he thinks it,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;He doesn't know how</span>
<span class="s0">terrible it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is</span>
<span class="s0">terrible!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?&quot; asked</span>
<span class="s0">Savelich.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. You must</span>
<span class="s0">forgive the trouble I have put you to,&quot; said Pierre, and seeing</span>
<span class="s0">Savelich smile, he thought: &quot;But how strange it is that he should</span>
<span class="s0">not know that now there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be</span>
<span class="s0">settled first of all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only</span>
<span class="s0">pretending. Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre reflected. &quot;No, another time.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had</span>
<span class="s0">been to see Princess Mary the day before and had there met--&quot;Whom do</span>
<span class="s0">you think? Natasha Rostova!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than</span>
<span class="s0">if he had seen Anna Semenovna.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Do you know her?&quot; asked Pierre.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I have seen the princess,&quot; she replied. &quot;I heard that they were</span>
<span class="s0">arranging a match for her with young Rostov. It would be a very good</span>
<span class="s0">thing for the Rostovs, they are said to be utterly ruined.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great</span>
<span class="s0">pity.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, she either doesn't understand or is pretending,&quot; thought</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. &quot;Better not say anything to her either.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre's journey.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;How kind they all are,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;What is surprising is that</span>
<span class="s0">they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of</span>
<span class="s0">interest to them. And all for me!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him</span>
<span class="s0">to send a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things</span>
<span class="s0">that were to be returned to their owners that day.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;And this man too,&quot; thought Pierre, looking into the face of the</span>
<span class="s0">Chief of Police. &quot;What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind.</span>
<span class="s0">Fancy bothering about such trifies now! And they actually say he is</span>
<span class="s0">not honest and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn't</span>
<span class="s0">he take bribes? That's the way he was brought up, and everybody does</span>
<span class="s0">it. But what a kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at</span>
<span class="s0">me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner.</span>

<span class="s0">As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned</span>
<span class="s0">down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The</span>
<span class="s0">picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the</span>
<span class="s0">burned-out quarters of the town, stretching out and concealing one</span>
<span class="s0">another, reminded him of the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he</span>
<span class="s0">met and their passengers, the carpenters cutting the timber for new</span>
<span class="s0">houses with axes, the women hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked</span>
<span class="s0">at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: &quot;Ah, there he</span>
<span class="s0">is! Let's see what will come of it!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">At the entrance to Princess Mary's house Pierre felt doubtful</span>
<span class="s0">whether he had really been there the night before and really seen</span>
<span class="s0">Natasha and talked to her. &quot;Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall</span>
<span class="s0">go in and find no one there.&quot; But he had hardly entered the room</span>
<span class="s0">before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his</span>
<span class="s0">sense of freedom. She was in the same black dress with soft folds</span>
<span class="s0">and her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet she was</span>
<span class="s0">quite different. Had she been like this when he entered the day before</span>
<span class="s0">he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her.</span>

<span class="s0">She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince</span>
<span class="s0">Andrew's fiancee. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on</span>
<span class="s0">her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there,</span>
<span class="s0">but Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house</span>
<span class="s0">with her.</span>

<span class="s0">Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening.</span>
<span class="s0">Though Princess Mary and Natasha were evidently glad to see their</span>
<span class="s0">visitor and though all Pierre's interest was now centered in that</span>
<span class="s0">house, by the evening they had talked over everything and the</span>
<span class="s0">conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly</span>
<span class="s0">broke off. He stayed so long that Princess Mary and Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">exchanged glances, evidently wondering when he would go. Pierre</span>
<span class="s0">noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy and embarrassed, but sat</span>
<span class="s0">on because he simply could not get up and take his leave.</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and</span>
<span class="s0">complaining of a headache began to say good night.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?&quot; she asked.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, I am not going,&quot; Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone</span>
<span class="s0">and as though offended. &quot;Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow--but I</span>
<span class="s0">won't say good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any</span>
<span class="s0">commissions for me,&quot; said he, standing before Princess Mary and</span>
<span class="s0">turning red, but not taking his departure.</span>

<span class="s0">Natasha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other</span>
<span class="s0">hand instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly</span>
<span class="s0">and intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had</span>
<span class="s0">plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and</span>
<span class="s0">long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.</span>

<span class="s0">When Natasha left the room Pierre's confusion and awkwardness</span>
<span class="s0">immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly</span>
<span class="s0">moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I wanted to tell you,&quot; said he, answering her look as if she</span>
<span class="s0">had spoken. &quot;Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess,</span>
<span class="s0">my dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of</span>
<span class="s0">her, I know it's impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a</span>
<span class="s0">brother to her. No, not that, I don't, I can't...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; he went on with an evident effort at self-control and</span>
<span class="s0">coherence. &quot;I don't know when I began to love her, but I have loved</span>
<span class="s0">her and her alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine</span>
<span class="s0">life without her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the</span>
<span class="s0">thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be</span>
<span class="s0">missing that possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell</span>
<span class="s0">me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!&quot; he added</span>
<span class="s0">after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I am thinking of what you have told me,&quot; answered Princess Mary.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love</span>
<span class="s0">at present...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love</span>
<span class="s0">was impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden</span>
<span class="s0">change in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be</span>
<span class="s0">hurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she</span>
<span class="s0">wished for.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To speak to her now wouldn't do,&quot; said the princess all the same.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what am I to do?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Leave it to me,&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;I know...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre was looking into Princess Mary's eyes.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Well?... Well?...&quot; he said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I know that she loves... will love you,&quot; Princess Mary corrected</span>
<span class="s0">herself.</span>

<span class="s0">Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a</span>
<span class="s0">frightened expression seized Princess Mary's hand.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; said Princess Mary with a smile. &quot;Write to her</span>
<span class="s0">parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it</span>
<span class="s0">to happen and my heart tells me it will.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can't be.... How happy I</span>
<span class="s0">am! No, it can't be!&quot; Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary's hands.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">she said.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I'll go. But I may come again</span>
<span class="s0">tomorrow?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Natasha was less animated</span>
<span class="s0">than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor</span>
<span class="s0">she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. &quot;Is it</span>
<span class="s0">possible? No, it can't be,&quot; he told himself at every look, gesture,</span>
<span class="s0">and word that filled his soul with joy.</span>

<span class="s0">When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could</span>
<span class="s0">not help holding it a little longer in his own.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this</span>
<span class="s0">treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that</span>
<span class="s0">it will one day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to</span>
<span class="s0">myself?... No, that's impossible!...&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Good-by, Count,&quot; she said aloud. &quot;I shall look forward very much to</span>
<span class="s0">your return,&quot; she added in a whisper.</span>

<span class="s0">And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face</span>
<span class="s0">which accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of</span>
<span class="s0">inexhaustible memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre. &quot;'I shall look forward very much to your return....' Yes, yes,</span>
<span class="s0">how did she say it? Yes, 'I shall look forward very much to your</span>
<span class="s0">return.' Oh, how happy I am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">said Pierre to himself.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XIX</span>


<span class="s0">There was nothing in Pierre's soul now at all like what had troubled</span>
<span class="s0">it during his courtship of Helene.</span>

<span class="s0">He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the</span>
<span class="s0">words he had spoken, or say: &quot;Oh, why did I not say that?&quot; and,</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Whatever made me say 'Je vous aime'?&quot; On the contrary, he now</span>
<span class="s0">repeated in imagination every word that he or Natasha had spoken and</span>
<span class="s0">pictured every detail of her face and smile, and did not wish to</span>
<span class="s0">diminish or add anything, but only to repeat it again and again. There</span>
<span class="s0">was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had</span>
<span class="s0">undertaken was right or wrong. Only one terrible doubt sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">crossed his mind: &quot;Wasn't it all a dream? Isn't Princess Mary</span>
<span class="s0">mistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I believe all</span>
<span class="s0">this--and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be sure</span>
<span class="s0">to smile and say: 'How strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn't</span>
<span class="s0">he know that he is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something</span>
<span class="s0">altogether different and higher.'&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now</span>
<span class="s0">make any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable</span>
<span class="s0">that if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things.</span>
<span class="s0">Everything ended with that.</span>

<span class="s0">A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself</span>
<span class="s0">incapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life--not for him alone</span>
<span class="s0">but for the whole world--seemed to him centered in his love and the</span>
<span class="s0">possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to</span>
<span class="s0">be occupied with one thing only--his future happiness. Sometimes it</span>
<span class="s0">seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was</span>
<span class="s0">himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be</span>
<span class="s0">busy with other interests. In every word and gesture he saw</span>
<span class="s0">allusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met by his</span>
<span class="s0">significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a</span>
<span class="s0">secret understanding between him and them. And when he realized that</span>
<span class="s0">people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his</span>
<span class="s0">whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that</span>
<span class="s0">occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.</span>

<span class="s0">When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,</span>
<span class="s0">or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the</span>
<span class="s0">assumption that everybody's welfare depended on this or that issue</span>
<span class="s0">of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and</span>
<span class="s0">surprise people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw</span>
<span class="s0">everybody--both those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning</span>
<span class="s0">of life (that is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who</span>
<span class="s0">evidently did not understand it--in the bright light of the emotion</span>
<span class="s0">that shone within himself, and at once without any effort saw in</span>
<span class="s0">everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved.</span>

<span class="s0">When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her</span>
<span class="s0">memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the</span>
<span class="s0">bliss he now knew. Prince Vasili, who having obtained a new post and</span>
<span class="s0">some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed</span>
<span class="s0">to him a pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.</span>

<span class="s0">Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity.</span>
<span class="s0">All the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained</span>
<span class="s0">true for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently,</span>
<span class="s0">but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the</span>
<span class="s0">views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved</span>
<span class="s0">correct.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I may have appeared strange and queer then,&quot; he thought, &quot;but I was</span>
<span class="s0">not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had</span>
<span class="s0">more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is</span>
<span class="s0">worth understanding in life, because... because I was happy.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Pierre's insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to</span>
<span class="s0">discover personal attributes which he termed &quot;good qualities&quot; in</span>
<span class="s0">people before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love,</span>
<span class="s0">and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes</span>
<span class="s0">for loving them.</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER XX</span>


<span class="s0">After Pierre's departure that first evening, when Natasha had said</span>
<span class="s0">to Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: &quot;He looks just, yes, just</span>
<span class="s0">as if he had come out of a Russian bath--in a short coat and with</span>
<span class="s0">his hair cropped,&quot; something hidden and unknown to herself, but</span>
<span class="s0">irrepressible, awoke in Natasha's soul.</span>

<span class="s0">Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.</span>
<span class="s0">To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to</span>
<span class="s0">the surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to</span>
<span class="s0">have forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer</span>
<span class="s0">complained of her position, did not say a word about the past, and</span>
<span class="s0">no longer feared to make happy plans for the future. She spoke</span>
<span class="s0">little of Pierre, but when Princess Mary mentioned him a</span>
<span class="s0">long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips</span>
<span class="s0">curved with a strange smile.</span>

<span class="s0">The change that took place in Natasha at first surprised Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. &quot;Can she</span>
<span class="s0">have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so</span>
<span class="s0">soon?&quot; she thought when she reflected on the change. But when she</span>
<span class="s0">was with Natasha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach</span>
<span class="s0">her. The reawakened power of life that had seized Natasha was so</span>
<span class="s0">evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence</span>
<span class="s0">Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her</span>
<span class="s0">heart.</span>

 <span class="s0">Natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling</span>
<span class="s0">that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad,</span>
<span class="s0">but bright and cheerful.</span>

<span class="s0">When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk</span>
<span class="s0">with Pierre, Natasha met her on the threshold.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?&quot; she repeated.</span>

<span class="s0">And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness</span>
<span class="s0">for her joy settled on Natasha's face.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;I wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">Understandable and touching as the look with which Natasha gazed</span>
<span class="s0">at her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her</span>
<span class="s0">agitation, these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her</span>
<span class="s0">brother and his love.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But what's to be done? She can't help it,&quot; thought the princess.</span>

<span class="s0">And with a sad and rather stern look she told Natasha all that</span>
<span class="s0">Pierre had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Natasha</span>
<span class="s0">was astounded.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;To Petersburg!&quot; she repeated as if unable to understand.</span>

<span class="s0">But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary's face she</span>
<span class="s0">guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Mary,&quot; said she, &quot;tell me what I should do! I am afraid of being</span>
<span class="s0">bad. Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You love him?&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Natasha.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Then why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,&quot; said Princess</span>
<span class="s0">Mary, who because of those tears quite forgave Natasha's joy.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;It won't be just yet--someday. Think what fun it will be when I</span>
<span class="s0">am his wife and you marry Nicholas!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Natasha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about</span>
<span class="s0">you.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">They were silent awhile.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;But why go to Petersburg?&quot; Natasha suddenly asked, and hastily</span>
<span class="s0">replied to her own question. &quot;But no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He</span>
<span class="s0">must....&quot;</span>






<span class="s0">FIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 --20</span>





<span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>


<span class="s0">Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had</span>
<span class="s0">subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the</span>
<span class="s0">mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of</span>
<span class="s0">their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.</span>

<span class="s0">Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the</span>
<span class="s0">movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time.</span>
<span class="s0">Various groups of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation</span>
<span class="s0">and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in</span>
<span class="s0">course of preparation.</span>

<span class="s0">The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to</span>
<span class="s0">shore as previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures</span>
<span class="s0">were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before.</span>
<span class="s0">They now seemed to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the</span>
<span class="s0">head of armies, who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by</span>
<span class="s0">ordering wars, campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless</span>
<span class="s0">movement by political and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.</span>

<span class="s0">The historians call this activity of the historical figures &quot;the</span>
<span class="s0">reaction.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical</span>
<span class="s0">personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the</span>
<span class="s0">reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and</span>
<span class="s0">Napoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte,</span>
<span class="s0">Chateaubriand, and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and</span>
<span class="s0">are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to</span>
<span class="s0">progress or to reaction.</span>

<span class="s0">According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in</span>
<span class="s0">Russia also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who</span>
<span class="s0">according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the</span>
<span class="s0">commencement of his reign, being the savior of Russia.</span>

<span class="s0">There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist</span>
<span class="s0">to learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander</span>
<span class="s0">for things he did wrong at this period of his reign.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he</span>
<span class="s0">did well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning</span>
<span class="s0">of his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution</span>
<span class="s0">to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakcheev,</span>
<span class="s0">favoring Golitsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkov and</span>
<span class="s0">Photius. He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active</span>
<span class="s0">army and disbanding the Semenov regiment.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the</span>
<span class="s0">historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good</span>
<span class="s0">for humanity.</span>

<span class="s0">What do these reproaches mean?</span>

<span class="s0">Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander</span>
<span class="s0">I (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle</span>
<span class="s0">with Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of</span>
<span class="s0">1813) flow from the same sources--the circumstances of his birth,</span>
<span class="s0">education, and life--that made his personality what it was and from</span>
<span class="s0">which the actions for which </span></pre>
