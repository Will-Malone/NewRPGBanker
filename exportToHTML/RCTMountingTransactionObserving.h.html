 * # Achtung! 
 * Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. 
 * Observers of this protocol are being called several times on every single mount transaction. Any thoughtless or 
 * suboptimal implementation of this protocol will slow down the whole app. Please, be responsible. 
 * 
 * # Usecases 
 * React Native platform-specific mounting layer has limitations when it comes to notifying view components about 
 * (coming or just happened) changes in the view tree. Implementing that generically for all components would make 
 * everything way to slow. For instance, the mounting layer does not have dedicated APIs to notify some component that: 
 * - Some ancestor of the component was reparented; 
 * - Some descendant of the component was added, removed or reparented; 
 * - Some ancestor of the component got new layout metrics (which might affect the absolute position of the component); 
 * - The transaction which affected the component's children just finished. 
 * 
 * If some very specific component (e.g. a performance logger) needs to handle some of the similar use-cases, it might 
 * rely on this protocol. 
 * 
 * # How to use 
 * - Declare conformance to this protocol for the ComponentView class. 
 * - Implement methods *only* suitable for a particular use case. Do not implement all methods if it is not strictly 
 * required. 
 * - Alternatively, an observer can be registered explicitly via `RCTSurface`. 
 * 
 * # Implementation details 
 * The framework checks all registered view classes for conformance to the protocol and for a set of implemented 
 * methods, then it stores this information for future use. When a view got created, the framework checks the info 
 * associated with the class and adds the view object to the list of listeners of the particular events (if needed). 
 * When a view got destroyed, the framework removes the view from suitable collections.
