   * The concept of `Owner` 
   * The purpose of `EventBeat` is handling an asynchronous callback to itself 
   * which is being delivered on some different thread. That brings a challenge 
   * of ensuring that the `EventBeat` object stays valid during the timeframe of 
   * callback execution. The concept of Owner helps with that. The owner is a 
   * shared pointer that retains (probably indirectly) the `EventBeat` object. 
   * To ensure the correctness of the call, `EventBeat` retains the owner 
   * (practically creating a retain cycle) during executing the callback. In 
   * case if the pointer to the owner already null, `EventBeat` skips executing 
   * the callback. It's impossible to retain itself directly or refer to the 
   * shared pointer to itself from a constructor. `OwnerBox` is designed to work 
   * around this issue; it allows to store the pointer later, right after the 
   * creation of some other object that owns an `EventBeat`.
