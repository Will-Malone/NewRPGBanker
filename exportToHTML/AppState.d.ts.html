 <span class="s0">* AppState can tell you if the app is in the foreground or background, 
 * and notify you when the state changes. 
 * 
 * AppState is frequently used to determine the intent and proper behavior 
 * when handling push notifications. 
 * 
 * App State Events 
 *      change - This even is received when the app state has changed. 
 *      focus [Android] - Received when the app gains focus (the user is interacting with the app). 
 *      blur [Android] - Received when the user is not actively interacting with the app. 
 * 
 * App States 
 *      active - The app is running in the foreground 
 *      background - The app is running in the background. The user is either in another app or on the home screen 
 *      inactive [iOS] - This is a transition state that currently never happens for typical React Native apps. 
 *      unknown [iOS] - Initial value until the current app state is determined 
 *      extension [iOS] - The app is running as an app extension 
 *
