<pre><span class="s0"># </span><span class="s2">Disallow use of deprecated functions </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">`no-deprecated-functions`</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">Over the years Jest has accrued some debt in the form of functions that have</span>
<span class="s2">either been renamed for clarity, or replaced with more powerful APIs.</span>

<span class="s2">While typically these deprecated functions are kept in the codebase for a number</span>
<span class="s2">of majors, eventually they are removed completely.</span>

<span class="s2">This rule requires knowing which version of Jest you're using - see</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">this section of the readme</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">../../README.md#jest-version-setting</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">for details</span>
<span class="s2">on how that is obtained automatically and how you can explicitly provide a</span>
<span class="s2">version if needed.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Rule details</span>

<span class="s2">This rule warns about calls to deprecated functions, and provides details on</span>
<span class="s2">what to replace them with, based on the version of Jest that is installed.</span>

<span class="s2">This rule can also autofix a number of these deprecations for you.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">`jest.resetModuleRegistry`</span>

<span class="s2">This function was renamed to `resetModules` in Jest 15, and is scheduled for</span>
<span class="s2">removal in Jest 27.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">`jest.addMatchers`</span>

<span class="s2">This function was replaced with `expect.extend` in Jest 17, and is scheduled for</span>
<span class="s2">removal in Jest 27.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">`require.requireActual` &amp; `require.requireMock`</span>

<span class="s2">These functions were replaced in Jest 21 and removed in Jest 26.</span>

<span class="s2">Originally, the `requireActual` &amp; `requireMock` the `requireActual`&amp;</span>
<span class="s2">`requireMock` functions were placed onto the `require` function.</span>

<span class="s2">These functions were later moved onto the `jest` object in order to be easier</span>
<span class="s2">for type checkers to handle, and their use via `require` deprecated. Finally,</span>
<span class="s2">the release of Jest 26 saw them removed from the `require` function altogether.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">`jest.runTimersToTime`</span>

<span class="s2">This function was renamed to `advanceTimersByTime` in Jest 22, and is scheduled</span>
<span class="s2">for removal in Jest 27.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">`jest.genMockFromModule`</span>

<span class="s2">This function was renamed to `createMockFromModule` in Jest 26, and is scheduled</span>
<span class="s2">for removal in a future version of Jest.</span>
